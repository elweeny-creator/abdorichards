Loved their features and everything really seemed great, but then when I started doing some digging and reading reviews, there were too many recent ones that were poor and has made me want to reconsider. \n\nWe have four people that all need to access the phone and we need to keep texts and voice messages organized so things are not getting dropped.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Interesting, I actually started with Iplum and had a hard time with it.

After talking with her, it became apparent she actually was never taught foundational knowledge of caring from a functional mobility standpoint (She had an extensive exercise packet that included ankle pumps, though). They owned equipment, hired caregivers, had two other family members and patient was being seen by home health intermittently previously. When I went over and met them, I was able to teach them how to do a two person transfer of the patient safely with a slide board from the hospital bed to their custom wheelchair. First time up in it in a year. It opened the world to them to know that they would be able to take her outside, tilt her back or do her hair, and it was really more about their piece of mine as well as the parent.

At the OP clinic, we do not have a receptionist and it falls on the therapists to answer phones, schedule patients, do patient intake, open up the clinic, etc. Since opening my own business and reducing my hours, my boss has been criticizing me for clocking in 10-15 minutes early to do the tasks above. My thinking is that this is the cost of not having a receptionist and I can’t be expected to do these tasks for free. Any insight would be appreciated!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I think your boss needs to consider who is supposed to be paid to open the clinic 15 min early so clients dont' arrive to a locked door. If they want someone else to do it they can schedule them and let you know that you shouldn't. If they want you to do it, you can't legally work off the clock.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I totally agree you should be paid for those extra tasks.

They want to determine if you have the ability to personally guarantee the lease. If you told them you are a start up I wouldn’t think they would have an expectation.

And what their interaction with the landlord has been. Consider also how safe you feel coming and going there by yourself at night. Also look closely at parking. Very closely.

So can you leave marketing materials up in the common area even when you are not there? Or is it a shared space that you will only be renting hourly/as needed? \n\nI recommend trying to negotiate an hourly rate or fixed lease amount instead of paying a percent of what you are making… the country club I rent from wanted me to do 70/30 with them but I asked for a fixed amount and they agreed to $650/month.

I am starting a mobile side business in CA. I just opened an S-Corp as we can’t do an LLC here. When meeting with my accountant for personal taxes he told me it was crazy to open an S-Corp prior to having 60/80 K in profit and I should just be a sole proprietor. He recommends that I un-incorporate as s-corps are extra steps and expensive in CA. I did the s-corp so my personal assets are protected but he insisted that a good insurance would cover that. This is against any and all recommendations that I have received. Any thoughts/recs??? I am so irritated about the prospect of starting the process over as I am just about ready to start accepting clients! Thank you in advance.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Regardless of what your CPA says, you as a PT can establish ONLY an S-Corp in CA. The CPA may not be aware of that\n\nCOMMENT 2: I actually don't think any of the below answers are correct. You don't HAVE to be an s-corp because s-corp is a tax designation entity. It has nothing to do with the structure of your business. Physical Therapy practices cannot be LLCs in California but individuals can elect to be either a sole proprietor or professional corporation. All professional corporations"}

He's also one of the fastest and has a ridiculously good throwing arm with great accuracy.  Unfortunately, his coaches won't give him a chance at QB because of his size, and the kid they play at QB isn't accurate enough to throw long passes.  Last game, I watched my son start to give up.  He was sitting on the sideline with tears in his eyes, trying not to cry and visibly sinking in to sadness.  He was avoiding looking at me so that he didn't melt completely in to tears, but at one point he glanced at me and I mouthed \"it's ok\" and pointed at my heart and back at him.  His coach I think noticed his change in temperment, too, and a few minutes later he was put in on defense.  I can only assume that he was told to rush the quarterback, because as soon as the ball was snapped my son forced him back 10 yards.  The next play, he did it again.  And his entire body changed after that.  He held his head up, he smiled, he started enjoying it again.\nAfter the game, I pulled him aside "}

My understanding is you can’t do that with healthshares because they aren’t in the right tax category for the accounting forms. Also, they are not guaranteeing care.

She earns more when she does patient care, which is what I hired her for. I own a 100% cash based practice, for reference.

He said those numbers are from someone he rented the space to a while back but they were from a bigger company. \nI told him I’m just starting out and that it may just be once a week as I build up clients. He said that the rates aren’t firm and would be up for more discussion. \nFor those who have been in this position; do you guys think this rental rate is typically fair? Or too high? \nJust wanted to get thoughts; I think it a bit high.\n\nCOMMENT 1: I pay 400 for a room for a month;)\n\nCOMMENT 2: $65/ hr?! That’s a lot of money!

Some places charge providers a flat fee per hour with a monthly capped charge."}

But for some reason when it comes to therapy, people do not want to pay. People pay enormous amount of money to veterinarians and usually it is all cash.

Also medbridge makes it really difficult and not pretty to make workout splits, ie different exercise on M/W/F while true coach allows that pretty easily. \n\nBecause of this, I just use google sheets with commenting turned on. If i had more cash pay patients, I'd probably use true coach ."}

The buyer tends not to care about things like Google reviews, novelty of practice, etc., they just care about the EBITDA. Even after selling, the buyer will likely expect you to be part of the practice for 18+ months to transition and get established. That's just based on one conversation I had with a broker. My practice has several employees, so maybe it's different for a solo practice.\n\nCOMMENT 2: At one point I was just curious what my business was worth so I had someone that buys similar businesses look at mine.

Just a general question: is shin pain common with growing pains? My oldest son will be 10 in Aug, and is on the small side so I’m expecting a growth spurt soon. He’s very active and pretty much never complains about pain, but was in tears this morning telling me he’s had shin pain for “weeks”. Apparently it’s inconsistent, not worse at night or with activity. I never had growing pains, so I have no idea, and I always have an underlying and probably unreasonable fear of osteosarcoma.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Could be shin splints.  I had that as a teen.  Horrible pain.  There is taping to help try YouTube and see if that helps\n\nCOMMENT 2: My son had horrible growing pains. His dad also had Osgood -Schlatters in his middle school years and had horrible pains. Might look into a cho-pat brace to wear with activities, it might offer some relief.

Pro is that the card is on file once you put it in initially so you don't have to swipe.  It is suppose to be hipaa secure.  My only Con so far is that the first payment did take extra time to process and I think I had to contact customer care, but they responded prompty and, after that, it has been reasonable turn around time for my standards.

From what I have heard from other providers using MedBridge, the cost of trying to get clients to answer the needed questions after each session, to correctly login each time, to set up and the cost (at least on MedBridge) was not worth it. Larger places have a PTA contacting them and basically urging them to keep logging so they can bill out. Also, at least in MedBridge, it doesn’t even track the time spent for you, so you still have to do that. Some sort of timer when you’re in X client’s chart seems helpful for this thing. It feels like one more way to track stuff that isn’t actually helping. (We have a EHR with great messaging so we hear when we need to about HEP and if it’s an issue. We can also track it in MedBridge but I prefer to have all I can in our EHR.)\n\nCOMMENT 2: Very cool! Yeh, please come back and let us know the cost. Thanks"}

How do I deal with the calls coming in if they’re Medicare patients? “Oh yeah sorry I can’t see you because you have Medicare, OR we can only do wellness” like, this sucks! I don’t want to sound uneducated in the subject or like I can’t see these people. Probably like 85% of people I’ll be seeing in the future have traditional Medicare. It’s just so discouraging when you’re trying to get started.

Please feel free to DM if needed.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Have the patient ask for a physical copy of the referral. They have every legal right to that and in the end it doesn’t matter where the referral is written to for physical therapy just that it exist and the patient can produce it for the PT clinic. ￼\n\nCOMMENT 2: These hospitals are buying up all competition and getting reimbursed more for their services by insurance companies than outpatient clinics. Greed is taking over the healthcare space"}

There is a difference between opening your own practice (non compete), and taking their company’s resources (non solicitation).

Got multiple emails about it ahead of time....starting in Jan/Feb timeframe I believe.  About 1/4 of the PTs there were private practice owners.  You're split up by states and you schedule meetings ahead of time with your senators and local districts.  I also went 5 years ago.  It's impossible for a lot of PTs to go because you absolutely cannot put 20+ PTs in a meeting room with a congressman...they physically wouldn't all fit.

It’s easy to want to quit on our dreams and desires when we have a bad day, because everything in our perspective makes it seem like we should. But if you have a good day and you still want to quit, then maybe strongly consider it.”  If you can have a good day and you still don’t feel like this is for you, don’t feel bad. Realize that you have the gumption to look at yourself in the face and know that this road isn’t for you. And that’s ok. But don’t give up just because you had a rough/bad day. They are going to happen…\n\nUncaged clinicians, don’t give up on your dream because of a rough patch. We all have them, reach out and talk to someone: a mentor, accountability partner, a friend. They can help you through. If after a good day, you still want to quit, then realize this may not be for you, "}

If we had even half-way decent membership % we could push for some real change and reimbursement.  If not, we can probably just keep watching reimbursements fall 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nCOMMENT 2: We have 100,000 members but there are 500,000 PTs and PTAs in the US. Membership makes the APTA stronger.

If growth is in your plan, then it may be more cost effective from a time management perspective to pay for an EMR platform now. Most will handle scheduling, billing, documentation, reports, template builds, super bills, etc. If you wait to make the swap once your business is busy you may not have the luxury of time to setup your EMR the way you want to. \n\nOn that note, I locked in PTEverywhere at a deep discount before I had a single patient. I am so glad that I did. I was able to create templates, scheduling, billing when I had the time to do so and now have access to look back at financial reports and patient data to day"}

So I'm curious of the comparison of the 2 in general and if Jane's billing system is reasonable with fees - I do all of my processing online and not in person with a card reader. \n\nAny thoughts on that and on the usability and friendliness of either system and on the costs of it in general would be super helpful!\n\nCOMMENT 1: We switched to PTE last year.

I wanted to be the kind of mom who could drop off and pick up her kids from school every day.\n\n \n\nSo, when my oldest daughter, just shy of nine years old at the time, suggested that I start my own healthcare business, I was skeptical at first. How could I possibly juggle the demands of running a business with the demands of being a mom?

I learned how to balance the demands of work and family, and I discovered that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.

I can try to design eval or daily note templates, but when they get exported as a pdf (to send to physicians, worker's comp, etc), it gets un-formatted and difficult to decipher. They have a 'help' page, but it's just a huge document that is unsearchable - you have to literally scan through all the text to find the topic you're looking for, and even then, it's often just basic info that's not usable.  There are major issues with being able to see what documents I've emailed or faxed to varioius people, as there is no record of that at all, and there is also no way to save common recipients (so I have to fully enter fax numbers or email address for literally every document)."}

It’s an additional thing that separates you from the insurance based clinic around the corner, shows that you actually care about their rehab journey and don’t view them just as another name, and is helpful regarding exercise changes/modifications that most PTs don’t get to make until the following week.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I am not cash base but if I were i think that level a follow up would be a great idea. I am working on a telehealth job which I have yet to start but I do know they have some kind of text message system as well. There is some question on hippa compliance so I would make sure they have signed a release stating they are aware that text messaging is not secure. Were there may be a different app system you could use that is considered secure. Something to think about."}

So if you have PTAs who you can hire under your LLC as 1099s you can offer the agency PT staffing from eval to DC by your staffing company.  Then you can make a little bit off each visit done by your PTAs. In Florida all you need is to get a Health Care Services Pool license. $600 every two years."}

So they cannot function independently as a 1099, only employee.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I would be extremely careful about hiring as a 1099. There are both IRS and state laws regarding this and many states are becoming much more vigilant about auditing small businesses for this. I have been through an audit it is very difficulty to prove that they fit the 1099 IC route in most situations for an assistant. Please get very good legal advice on this and be prepared to face an audit on it. The penalties can be significant."}

I am a physical therapist and have 16 years experience, with the last 11.5 years being in home health with a mostly geriatric population. In my work with senior patients, I find that most of them won’t keep up with their exercise routine after I discharge. I get it. It’s really hard to start and stick with an exercise routine when no one is holding you accountable. But when they don’t keep up their exercises, they usually lose the progress they made with me and end up weaker, often falling and breaking something, at which point they’re referred back for therapy again and we start back at square one (or even further back). I wish insurance companies would pay for regular, ongoing therapy visits to prevent this kind of decline, but the reality is that they just don’t. The patients I treat are homebound, so going to an outpatient clinic usually isn’t an option. Mobile therapy options that bill as outpatient are also limited (my sister actually had her own practice doing this but recently moved out of state, and I have no desire to deal with the insurance headache that she had to, all for minimal reimbursement).\n"}

What’s the shoulders position in supine? Is your grandma able to be mobilized to assess laxity? If the deformity on xray is related to laxity then what other options does she have?

So therapeutic exercise can be used for different professions than just physical therapist. So physicians can bill 97110 and they would put their modifier instead of ours(GP). Also, the Herman and Wallace Institute allows a wide array of providers to take their courses, including Naturopathic Doctors. Many other pelvic floor courses can be taken by others.

In severe OA cases ROM can be quite compromised prior to Sx. Long term soft tissue contractures, muscle atrophy and fascial restrictions can take a long time to improve. \nFunction is far more important than end ROM. \nInflammation of local soft tissue and scarring can decrease over time. Patience is key. \nPilates reformer exercises can work magic on TKRs.\n\nCOMMENT 2: My 2 cents:\n1. How about focusing on function rather than pain. \n2. Her AROM is really good at 4 months, could also be that pain is inhibiting you from stretching further. Maybe she is ov"}

If cupping is the only thing they want, you can just charge cash for a wellness/recovery visit. PT is a full eval and YOU decide whether cupping is the most effective tool to use.

Right now, providing a la carte services align with my business goals but i can definitely see people prefer not to provide it. Make sure you’re charging for your time appropriately!! Massage therapists make at LEAST $1/minute and that’s excluding tip, mobile services, and additional modalities. My rates are $2.5-3/minute. I know you didn’t ask….but I figured I’d just put it out there. Hope that helps!!  😊\n"}

I am contemplating starting up a mobile practice and maybe add a brick and mortar spot if the business justifies it. I currently work home heath 3 days a week and 2 Saturdays a month in acute but also have peds and outpatient experience. I am saddened on the push to DC people so soon from home health and now the census had been very low. I enjoy working with the older adult group especially those with PD and dementia as well as those who are generally weak. I'd like to keep it cash pay/private pay to avoid  insurance altogether. \n\nMy questions are: The older adult population is heavy Medicare so can you even offer cash services for physical therapy or does it have to be marketed as wellness? \n\nWhat are good software programs to use for documenting as well as for accounting purposes? \n\nHow do I go about marketing myself initially to the community? \n\nThank you all for reading this far.😊\n\nPicture for a chuckle 😆\n\nCOMMENT 1: Hi, geriatrics are my niche and I am only cash based.  I don't find it very difficult to brand what I am doing as wellness with this population bc most of my people really want a consistent exercise program tha"}

I usually feel that their ethics are good, but I’ve recently started dry needling and was educated to bill it as manual therapy. I don’t feel comfortable with this, but they haven’t been willing to set up a cash pay system for dry needling. Do I continue to dry needle and not bill for it? Or just tell them I will no longer be providing dry needling services?\n\nCOMMENT 1: The answer is actually really simple. The Insurnace companies tell you. I can’t answer for you as it depends on where you are but all Insurnace companies very specifically tell you what to bill and if covered In their medical guidelines. Just a quick google search…. Hope that helps\n\nCOMMENT 2: I'm not sure why you feel it isn't manual therapy? \nImo, with PT services, our time should be reimbursed the maximum amount, because it shouldn't matter what we choose to do in our tx session; it should all be up to us. Why would we not get the best reimbursement for our time?"}

I was wondering what the top notch weight lifting certification programs are? Preferably one non biased to thick thighs 😂\n\nIn undergrad I would beat most classmates in the 1 and 2 mile races we had, placing third in female/male races. I beat everyone in the class in the blindfolded balance board exercises. We had university BB players, lacrosse players and football players in that class. And I lasted longer running while having VO2max tested. That was great because it smashed misconceptions about big girls and the re-defined what “fit” or “athletic” means. I have a couple weight lifting courses I’m looking at but they seem very generic. Any and all advice appreciated 🏋️‍♀️\n\nCOMMENT 1: I would go for the CFMA Cert from ICE. It will cover the Olympic lifts plus a lot more and be much more applicable across the board for many types of fitness athletes. This is coming from someone with an Olympic Weightlifting background and the USAW level 1. Unless you only want to work with Weightlifters, but they will likely look for someone who has weightlifting experience before coming to you to be honest.\n\nCOMMENT 2: Another vote for the ICE CMFA certification, I'm so glad I did that"}

I took their 1st peds course in the 90's. I've used it on babies ever since. It's like magic on the tiny ones. I think you may have to take the intro course 1st so you learn how to feel the CST rhythm before you try to feel it on a baby. But not sure if that's still the case\n\nCOMMENT 2: I’m a pediatric/neuro PT and am trained in CST through Uplegder. There is also a massage therapist named Lori Henderickson who does classes on infant CST. I think her class is good, but you need to know the foundational CST concepts first. She just talks about her infant specific protocol without going over a lot of the foundational anatomy and physiology."}

For example, If the patient is in Ontario when you performed the service (in person or over phone/video) you would be subject to laws in Ontario.  It is nearly impossible to know how each jurisdiction would behave in the event of a law violation or complaint EVERYWHERE in the world.  \n\n2)  The typical course of action of a governing board such as a state PT board to a practic act violation would be a cease and desist.  If you are sent a cease and desist, you can try to present evidence that you are NOT, in fact, violating the practice act to see if you can convince them to let you continue, or you could simply cease and desist and let it go.  They would only have you cease and desist in THEIR jurisdiction.  For example if the Califor"}

The whole point is for individuals not to sue you personally or go after your personal assets. You can definitely ask several people about this including your insurance agent, your CPA, or your small business attorney. You will have to calculate the risk on your part to determine the benefit of insuring both and how much patient care you're actually doing.\n\nCOMMENT 2: From HPSO, yep, that’s pretty accurate."}

Like others said, it fulfilled a mission to collaborate on patients with limb loss and offer a space for older adults. The caseload hasn't grown in the brick and mortar ad I had hoped but I smile every time I put my key in the door and see my logo on the wall so I'm gonna keep it going for a while and see if I can make it work!\n\nCOMMENT 2: I still provide mobile visits but also wanted to have a brick n mortar space to fully live out the vision I have.   I think it’s important to really think out what you want to do with your business and if having a clinic space helps move you toward that goal.  For me I envisioned having a space that I could host workshops and education seminars to help the community and I wanted to be able to offer other services that can’t be provided in a mobile setting.\n\nI also think it’s important not to rush into a space, make sure it’s the best fit for you before taking the leap."}

I live in NC & am licensed here as well as the other therapists that work for me. I realize the home health company in Florida would have to discharge her from her home health episode of care before she would be eligible to receive PT through Med B.

I started by talking to PTs I had already worked with to see who would be willing to do some evals for me. I am a cash clinic so I’m able to pay well and I have a great working relationship with many PTs. I had a taker and she just works 4-8 hours per month doing evals PRN around her other schedule. I now have a second location with another PT that gives me 4-6 hrs per month. I do all treatments. \nStart networking, be generous as you fiscally can and flexible with schedule and you might be surprised who is open to working for you."}

Her mother informed me that she has had horrible posture for years (her mother is reportedly always on her case about her posture).

Some insurance companies only cover the live class, not the recording or pre-recorded content. Ask a few companies lots of questions about what you would be covered for traveling and online. I highly recommend a lawyer to either create or review your waivers. But it is what you are covered for that will really come down to the wire if something happens.

I have specialty experience in both pelvic health and spinal deformities(scoliosis/schuermanns etc), both of which I feel are underserved populations.

I live in TN, I’m relatively new here, I’m using the compact agreement between TN and NC. I have an idea of services and the model I want to use, but the legalities of starting a practice confuse me. I don’t plan on accepting any insurance. \n\n2) If I start simple, with only offering private Pilates lessons (no PT), does this conflict with my PT license? I’ve been told that the liability will always fall on my PT license, even if I am only offering personal training/Pilates. I have a 4 month old at home and my husband is deployed, so I thought the private Pilates/personal training would be an easier place to start than PT services, but I don’t want to have any conflict or fail to follow any rules. For those that offer both personal training and PT, how do you keep the 2 separate? \n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading, hoping those questions m"}

I employ PTAs and OTAs and have never thought that.  So I would first ask yourself, how do you see them? What makes it lesser quality care?  To be honest, most PTs are so caught up in evals and paperwork, they have little time for treatment.  On the other hand,, assistants only treat, all day long.  They are experts.  But it doesn't matter what anyone here thinks, it's what you think.  If you have any biases, then you won't be able to convince anyone otherwise.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I used to manage several PTAs before opening my practice and if you spend the time to teach and train them they can be very good and provide super high quality care. If you can pair that with a good personality the patients may even request them over you. Just like we were taught, they can be taught too."}

I chose them because they have no fees on account maintenance or transactions and no minimum balance requirement. You can also add sub accounts to help organize your money without having to open up several separate checking accounts. You earn 1.5% in interest too. They came recommended on Forbes and Nerd Wallet. They are an online banking compny, so if you’re looking for physical branch locations, I’d look elsewhere. Obviously since I just opened it this morning I can’t speak to how they are in the long term, but those are the things I liked about them! Hope that helps!"}

Review time.\n\nWe all dread those meetings with our superiors.\n\nWe are required to fill out forms answering questions about how WE think we have been performing.  Then, we are asked about our goals over the next 6 months and 1 year.\n\nAfter 18 years of showing up to this rodeo, I knew that MY goals didn’t matter - unless they were to attend certain CEU courses, increase my units/visit charged, and to see more patients.\n\nHow did I think I did?\n\nWell, I think I got a lot of people better, back to living their lives, and happy that they had me as a therapist.\n\nHowever, you tell me, Mr. Director.\n\nThis review was probably like ones you have been through.  And not unlike most others I had experienced.\n\nThere was the discussion that if I added just three more exercises to the patient’s (ther-ex) program at least every other day, how it would positively impact my yearly bonus.\n\nSpeaking of adding exercises, this would also help to get my average units/visit up.  This would get me out of “last place” for the entire company.\n\nMy director then requested that I start documenting each week as to why a patient did not attend treatments 3x/wk for that week.

Do you feel that there is a need for years of experience before doing so or is it more about just doing it?\n\nSometimes I feel that if I am going to charge cash rates that I need to have a couple of extra skills like dry needling and/or manipulations so that I provide more than just the average PT.\n\nOr is it just providing that amazing customer service. What really is the thing?…\n\nCOMMENT 1: I remember a therapist telling me exactly this. “Work for 5 years. Develop your skills and make connections. Then go on your own.”\n\nTotal BS. \n\nYou can hire experience instead of waiting to gain it. \n\nIn a cash model people aren’t buying the commodity of PT. They are buying “The Experience” not YOUR experience. \n\nEvery year you spend not doing things that move you toward your goal is a year driving in the wrong direction.\n\nCOMMENT 2: This is a great question 🙂 and I’m going to say what I think you need to hear, maybe not what you want to hear. \n\nI’ve got 3 thoughts that I think will be helpful:\n\nMost people will consider clinical skill, personal growth and finances, so let’s tackle them. \n\n1.

Mostly just read what everyone has to say. But I’m trying to become Uncaged and I was wondering if anyone here has experience with having a clinic space in your home or in a shed type building in the back yard. I don’t really have the space in my home but I’ve thought about the possibility of having a shed type building finished out in my back yard for a clinic space. It is just me and I think ultimately it would be a lot cheaper than commercial rent. I’m planning to start mobile whenever I find my first clients until I gain some momentum and then transition to a brick and mortar clinic. Any considerations with having a clinic out of your home/personal property? Anyone who has done this or thought about it and decided against it and why? Anyone who has done it and loved it? Legally what kind of hoops are there to jump through as well as does it change anything with insurance (homeowners vs business)? Basically I’m just trying to decide if this is a viable option or if I should bite the bullet and rent a space. I welcome any and all feedback at this point.\n\nCOMMENT 1: I’m about to open my business from my home in about a month. I was a little nervous about cli"}

Have a 79 year old women as a patient right now who is going on 6 weeks now of having a 8-10/10 pain that affects most of her right side from her rib cage down to her glutes (described as burning with shooting bouts of pain). \n\nWe just started PT 2 weeks ago (she was undergoing testing by primary MD - X-rays and US without significant findings other than some OA) and have only been able to meet once due to scheduling conflicts. \n\nShe struggles to do even very basic movements including seated flexion, side bending to open up space on the right side, and ant / post pelvic tilts in standing as she cannot tolerate any other positions. Tissue including glutes and paraspinals are very sensitive to touch. Lumbar ROM reveals increased pain with motions closing down space on facet joints on the R side but doesn’t recreate pain in rib cage / thoracic pain. Central and unilateral PAs reproduce some but not all of the areas of pain on the right side radiating into glutes between L3-L5. \n\nShe does have a history of RA but mostly in her hands and has not had recent blood work. does anyone have experience with RA flare ups in the spine?
