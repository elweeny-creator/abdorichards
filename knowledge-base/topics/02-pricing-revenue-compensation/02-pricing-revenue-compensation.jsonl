You’ll need to check with your accountant and it’s based on the type of business structure.

It incentivizes people by having a small discount and it fills my schedule with more reliability than selling packages. 5% isn’t much of a discount but it always makes people happy 😃 and it’s not a burden to me financially."}

TIA!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I looked into it. Read the fine print. And check out the fee rates, they’ll take a pretty penny from you. You’ll have to decide for yourself, I got signed up and decided to never use it.\n\nCOMMENT 2: They charge you 8-13% transaction fees.  But we do accept it.  We do not allow for package discounts if a client uses care credit."}

I have been seeing clients privately for 25 years. I have a good referral source in place and am ready to expand a bit. I have 3 therapists, who I know very well and are ready to take any referrals I can’t handle time-wise.  \nMy plan is to do the marketing, get the referrals, see the client for the initial evaluation/consultation, get payment for a Package of sessions, and then assign them to an appropriate therapist. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1.  What’s the best way to set up this relationship (I’m in California)?\n\n2. I will have them sign the document declaring they are a separate business (I forgot the name of it). \n\n3. How should I pay them (Venmo, Zelle vs check etc)?\n\n4. What % of the total fee that I collect should I pay them?\n \n5. Do I 1099 my payments to them?\n\nAnd there’s probably some considerations/ legal items I’m not thinking about as well. I’m open to suggestions!\n\nThank you!", "comments": [{"text": "I would definitely pay by check & hopefully they will understand they would be independent contractors since they will be 1099’d at the end of the year. (I think I read that Venmo was going to start reporting when someone received more than $600/year from one source to the government & that might create a nightmare for the IC).

I have been seeing clients privately for 25 years. I have a good referral source in place and am ready to expand a bit. I have 3 therapists, who I know very well and are ready to take any referrals I can’t handle time-wise.  \nMy plan is to do the marketing, get the referrals, see the client for the initial evaluation/consultation, get payment for a Package of sessions, and then assign them to an appropriate therapist. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1.  What’s the best way to set up this relationship (I’m in California)?\n\n2. I will have them sign the document declaring they are a separate business (I forgot the name of it). \n\n3. How should I pay them (Venmo, Zelle vs check etc)?\n\n4. What % of the total fee that I collect should I pay them?\n \n5. Do I 1099 my payments to them?\n\nAnd there’s probably some considerations/ legal items I’m not thinking about as well. I’m open to suggestions!\n\nThank you!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I would definitely pay by check & hopefully they will understand they would be independent contractors since they will be 1099’d at the end of the year. (I think I read that Venmo was going to start reporting when someone received more than $600/year from one source to the government & that might create a nightmare for the IC). The % of the total fee would depend on how much “extra work” you’re needing to do ie billing, marketing, accounting etc. I pay my IC’s 80% of what I (my company) receives as payment.

She mentioned taking 20% of each visit for my patients and 50% of each visit when I see her patients. My patients are defined as anyone I bring in (for example, if I treat one of my mobile patients in the office) and her patients are anyone who calls to see her (so if someone calls to see her and learns of the 6 month wait list and doesn't want to wait, she'll direct them to me). 50% seems really high to me so I'm curious to get other's opinion's on this! For context, she has a great reputation, >20 years experience, has mentioned she'd be willing to teach me in some specialized areas and otherwise is very flexible with no min number of days/hours required and I would still work for myself. That being said, it's still 50% for a finders fee and I would be doing all of the work with the patient. Since I'm just going from side hustle to full time, I am a bit nervous about building up a case load and this would be one way that could majorly help with that.

When you are just starting out as your own business, it may seem as if the therapist is doing all the work(providing care to the pt and completing the documentation) and yes this is the revenue for the business. However, you need to realize how much goes into the greater picture of running a business than just treating patients and as many people in this group are just starting out, the full picture isn't visible yet(it wasn't for me until this year as I decide to grow my business with additional team members, services, products). As she is a business owner of a brick and mortar clinic, >20 years of experience, high reputation and an impressive 6 month waiting list, she has done EVERYTHING!  She has put in her time, effort, risk, sleepless nights, 60-80 hr work weeks, covering any shift a staff can't, learning HR/bookkeeping/accounting/compliance/risk mngmt/leadership and the cost/time each entails, mistakes in hiring/pricing/policies/EMRs/risk mngmt/scheduling, overcoming and improving on her processes to avoid those same mistakes in the future, cost of property, marketing and advertising,  paying staff instead of herself probably during slow times and so MUCH more!!!  She is also taking a risk on bringing any practitioner or employee into a business she has built for 20 yrs. Her profit margin is not 50% if she pays you 50%. If the business runs on a 5-10% profit margin and she pays a % higher to her team, that's a significant loss in the margin, so as the CEO, that comes out of her CEO salary so to speak. The COST of Attraction, Aquisition and Retention has been Tens of thousands each year for 20 years in addition to overhead costs of admin, environment, etc. We, as a profession, are kind, good-willed humans, and we can be that while being a business owner also, which includes setting your boundaries on what it is worth to the owner to continue running the business. Referring patients out would be giving away her very hard earned Attraction and Aquisition potential to only to give it to someone else for their profit. There is a great likelihood that referring them to someone like a new Uncaged clinician, she will not get them back because that Uncaged member is going to do everything in their power to retain that client, right?  So then she would have worked for years on Attraction and Aquistion(the most costly for the owner) only to give the source of revenue to someone else. That first phone call can make or break a client, so that's the most important call, that's when you get the commitment from the client. For the same reason becoming Uncaged is risky, is the very reason she must work her numbers wisely. Imagine working diligently to get your schedule up to your first 10 clients, your max,  and having to give them to someone else for no return on investment to you. She has INVESTED 20 years of building trust and respect of the community!  Huge accomplishment! Congratulations to her!  Now you just have to decide if you want to be part of what she has already built or if you are ready/willing/capable of doing the same.   Either way, choose what is right for you. Respect the process. Even if you were to work with her and didn't appreciate the numbers, you may be able to learn lots just being involved in her system with your new frame of mind as a new business owner. The whole point, there's another side to the coin. Thanks for letting me share.

I was approached by a local PT who has a booming business (>6 month wait list) to work in her office (still be my own biz owner). She mentioned taking 20% of each visit for my patients and 50% of each visit when I see her patients. My patients are defined as anyone I bring in (for example, if I treat one of my mobile patients in the office) and her patients are anyone who calls to see her (so if someone calls to see her and learns of the 6 month wait list and doesn't want to wait, she'll direct them to me). 50% seems really high to me so I'm curious to get other's opinion's on this! For context, she has a great reputation, >20 years experience, has mentioned she'd be willing to teach me in some specialized areas and otherwise is very flexible with no min number of days/hours required and I would still work for myself. That being said, it's still 50% for a finders fee and I would be doing all of the work with the patient. Since I'm just going from side hustle to full time, I am a bit nervous about building up a case load and this would be one way that could majorly help with that. Does anyone else practice in a similar model? What % split seems fair and reasonable given this situation? I'd love to hear all thoughts an opinions! Thanks\n\nCOMMENT 1: When you hire someone you plan to pay them 30-50% of the revenue they bring in. It sounds like she’s looking at it like you’re an employee\n\nCOMMENT 2: I can understand why this may sound as if the price is skewed to her benefit, but IT SHOULD BE!

Contact a health insurance broker.\n\nCOMMENT 2: One option is to check your state’s health insurance marketplace (the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare). See if there are insurance brokers associated with it who can help you look at plans on the marketplace (the brokers are no cost to you) and ask them if you might qualify for tax credits which lessen your monthly cost. I did this after a layoff and was pleasantly surprised about the affordability - though I’m not getting family coverage so can’t speak to that part."}

Wanted to get a sense of what I should be asking for a workshop I may potentially do. \nIt's not meant to make bank or promote an offer. just trying to help people out with some information.\nIf I would do it on my own, it would be really informal and I would have done it at a low cost for the participants and hope to get at least 30 people attending for 10 dollars each.\nI am in talks with an organization (in Montreal, Canada) that is interested to join me for it. If I contract it to the non profit, I can choose my rate and hope they have the budget for it. They will not be charging the participants. So i don't want to highball it but don't want to lowball it.\nIt will take some prep on my part and be about 90 minutes. \nDo I charge my hourly rate (That people pay to see me)? because that may be too high for them to afford. but I also don't know how much they can afford. I don't want to name them but for context, this non profit provides medical, legal and social services to Montreal youth. they have a number of medical, social, and legal services including: Information and referrals,, Medical clinics, Legal assistance and consultations, counseling, and Workshops on legal rights, safer drug use, babysitting and other social topics such as self-esteem, body-image, and boundaries. (showing that they are a more liberal organization and likely use their money to help people ++ if that means anything).\nTL:DR: how do I come up with a rate?

Wanted to get a sense of what I should be asking for a workshop I may potentially do. \nIt's not meant to make bank or promote an offer. just trying to help people out with some information.\nIf I would do it on my own, it would be really informal and I would have done it at a low cost for the participants and hope to get at least 30 people attending for 10 dollars each.\nI am in talks with an organization (in Montreal, Canada) that is interested to join me for it. If I contract it to the non profit, I can choose my rate and hope they have the budget for it. They will not be charging the participants. So i don't want to highball it but don't want to lowball it.\nIt will take some prep on my part and be about 90 minutes. \nDo I charge my hourly rate (That people pay to see me)? because that may be too high for them to afford. but I also don't know how much they can afford. I don't want to name them but for context, this non profit provides medical, legal and social services to Montreal youth. they have a number of medical, social, and legal services including: Information and referrals,, Medical clinics, Legal assistance and consultations, counseling, and Workshops on legal rights, safer drug use, babysitting and other social topics such as self-esteem, body-image, and boundaries. (showing that they are a more liberal organization and likely use their money to help people ++ if that means anything).\nTL:DR: how do I come up with a rate? If I DO highball it, and they say no, you think they'll be ok to negotiate for something they can work with?\nThanks a lot\nFeel free to message me if you are more comfortable with that\n\nCOMMENT 1: Don’t speculate what they can afford.
