I don’t yet have the ability to bill insurances and all that fun stuff myself yet. I’m having a hard time finding a company (besides Luna) who can handle the admin side of our job while letting me see someone through their whole POC. So far everyone just wants me to do SUP visits while a PTA treats. I’ve already amassed a decent amount of patients over the last couple years, but due to recent changes I just need a new company to contract for to see my people. Any leads would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I'm in Vero Beach , FL feel free to reach out\n\nCOMMENT 2: I'm in Central Florida and there is also a company called LifeCare Home therapy which does that.

Only about 180,000 people.  There’s plenty of business for us all! \n\nMost people are blue collar workers just like my dad was. People value being taken care of and I’m finding that out the more I push! \n\nKeep your head up and keep moving forward! \n\nDon’t waste time being busy, but be busy doing the things that work!\n\nForgot this originally. Even though I am still doing prn HH; the mindset shift if I’m now working on my business and doing part time for them vs part time in my business and HH as my main source WAS HUGE!!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Jeremy Sutton Love watching your testimony unfold.  Keep up the great work and thank you for being a light\n\nCOMMENT 2: Nice work!! 🙌🏽 Are you charging for drive time or just writing it off? I’m doing this as well (combo of HH prn and cash mobile) but some of my mobile pts are more than a half hour drive away… it definitely cuts down on how many patients I can see if I’m doing those long drives."}

This is a question for everyone who has started their own mobile practice.\n\nWhat was the main reason you started it?\n\nLooking back at that reason specifically, has it lived up to your expectations?\n\nAlso, looking at it now, what are YOUR biggest pros and cons of starting your own mobile practice?\n\nThank you in advance for your responses.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Less overhead, getting out of my W2 job, being able to provide exceptional care without having insurance dictating what we could do (cash pay practice). Better income potential than W2. And yes would never go back\n\nPros: flexible schedule, not paying rent for a clinic, pts love the concierge level experience vs what they get with HH\n\nCons: driving to other pts but isn't that big of a deal\n\nCOMMENT 2: Pro: flexibility, time to research best/updated practices, spending time with patients rather than documenting for the insurance companies, I found a new passion for business operations. \n\nCon: time that goes into start up, marketing takes $, balancing a job with benefits and slowly decreasing that caseload so I can slowly increase my private pay caseload."}

Thought this would be a great idea. I’ve had good back and forth convos via e mail, met with some in person, brought pizza, but haven’t gotten much from them and it’s been 3 weeks. They make it seem like there’s such demand, but I’m sitting here like hello? Remmeber i said i can see your people ASAP?\n\nCOMMENT 1: It might be that the medical reason and need for multiple disciplines that qualified them for inpatient rehab means needing a nurse and OT and/or SLP post discharge and HH can do all of that. People also like that HH is paid at 100% by Medicare and they might not have a supplement to cover the Med B 20% so patients “pick” HH. I see that all the time in ALFs. The patient could easily be seen by Med B but HH is coming in instead.\n\nCOMMENT 2: Generally speaking most (not all) clients when they leave rehabs will qualify as homebound which under Medicare is paid 100% for a home health agency/ provider so most will go that route because there is no copay. Once they are no longer homebound they do not qualify for HH. Also transportation is NOT a qualifier under Medicare to make you homebound. You may have “no way” to get transportation but are physically able to leave the home, Medicare will not pay for home health that way.
