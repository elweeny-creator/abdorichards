I’m in the middle of my maternity leave and the idea of having to go back to work and leave my baby girl is daunting! I’ve always toyed with the idea of starting a mobile cash-based practice but chicken out everytime! I took a Herman & Wallace Pelvic Health course last summer and never got to use anything I learned. I’m seriously considering attempting to get something mobile started now and would like my focus to be on pregnant and postpartum mothers. I haven’t taken any classes on pregnancy but would love to. I’m not able to do this fill time but could start slow and see where it takes me. What is the reality that something like this could work? Mobile cash-based pregnant/postpartum patients. Any insight is more than welcome. Can anyone weigh in on this? I’m so over working for other people and would love to give my girl all of the attention she needs! Thank you!!!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I’d say this is definitely doable but don’t just fall for the fantasy of how great it sounds. It CAN be, but after a lot of work, even if you plan to start slowly. There will be a lot of work to go into starting a business you won’t know about til you start, even slow/part time. I did this coming back from my first mat leave and I have no regrets, but wish someone painted a realistic picture for me. It was way more work and is now the flexible venture I wanted. The end goal of working part time and being with my kiddo was possible, but the work to get it going wasn’t as simple or “part time” as I thought. I would much rather work hard for myself than someone else, but just want you to have a realistic view of what it entails. \n\nI also think you’ll need to take more coursework to adequately treat this population as a solo provider without mentorship. \n\nI’d also recommend the Business Accelerator course through Pelvic PT Rising. It’s an investment that will save you a lot of headaches and mistakes as you launch!\n\nCOMMENT 2: Definitely doable but don’t get confused, it’s not “less work” or less time."}

So I went in network with Medicare and BCBS and hate all the paperwork, uncertainty, errors (my fault) that delay billing… the oops the copay was higher… I have a wait list but  I don’t want to play the game. I wanna get my $150/session in cash/card and go back to minimal paperwork…\n\nAt this point my hh job was easier (I was a rare spoiled one making good $$ working little)\n\nSo how to transition to a cash only business? Do I open a different cash only location? Close, get a job, and start weaning off job again? Do new people cash? I am lost but to stay as it is I was better off at my job…"}

I am hearing up to open a brick and mortar location, with PT and sime other services.  There is a location that I am looking at in a small shopping center.  Price is good, but not really a desirable center with a 7/11 and a few other shops.  On the other hand it is very centrally located in the middle of tons of housing, next to my kids school, next to a park where all the kids play baseball and soccer.  Do you think location and reputation will make people look past the rest of the shopping center?  All advice is appreciated!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Ask the other tenants how they like being there…. And what their interaction with the landlord has been. Consider also how safe you feel coming and going there by yourself at night. Also look closely at parking. Very closely. That can be a big deal breaker for patients if the parking is sparse, or they have to walk far to get to your suite.\n\nCOMMENT 2: Always remember. Location. Location. Location.

Since it's a brand new business I don't know if the business will flop or take off so hard to know what to worry about when it comes to size of a space. Anyone been in this situation before? Advice?\n\nCOMMENT 1: Negotiate...if you really like the space, but it's on the small side, perhaps you can offer to pay  more/month for say a year commitment, and then options to renew clause at 6 month increments ( with small percentage increases) for example. Doesn't hurt to throw things out there if you haven't already!\n\nCOMMENT 2: Write in a back out clause. We have been in business a long time sign every 5 years.   Our back out is a 6 month notice. No penalty."}

He's also one of the fastest and has a ridiculously good throwing arm with great accuracy.  Unfortunately, his coaches won't give him a chance at QB because of his size, and the kid they play at QB isn't accurate enough to throw long passes.  Last game, I watched my son start to give up.  He was sitting on the sideline with tears in his eyes, trying not to cry and visibly sinking in to sadness.  He was avoiding looking at me so that he didn't melt completely in to tears, but at one point he glanced at me and I mouthed \"it's ok\" and pointed at my heart and back at him.  His coach I think noticed his change in temperment, too, and a few minutes later he was put in on defense.  I can only assume that he was told to rush the quarterback, because as soon as the ball was snapped my son forced him back 10 yards.  The next play, he did it again.  And his entire body changed after that.  He held his head up, he smiled, he started enjoying it again.\nAfter the game, I pulled him aside and said \"listen to me.  There are going to be times that you don't get the shot you think you deserve.  And in those times, you'll have 2 choices.  You can give up and stop trying, and that's ok.  You can make that choice.  But if you do that, no one will ever give you that chance again.  Or, you can choose to go back out and prove to the doubters why they should've believed in you in the first place.  And that's what you did today.  You made them see why they have to give you a chance.  Because you're worth it.\"\nToday has been discouraging, and frustrating, and a little teary on my end.  But I've replayed that conversation in my head a few times, and decided to listen to myself.\nIt's SUPER hard to start a small business, especially when you're competing with 100 other options.  But it's our job to bounce back and prove why we can't be ignored.", "comments": [{"text": "We have so much to learn from our kids and how we choose to guide them through life.

He's also one of the fastest and has a ridiculously good throwing arm with great accuracy.  Unfortunately, his coaches won't give him a chance at QB because of his size, and the kid they play at QB isn't accurate enough to throw long passes.  Last game, I watched my son start to give up.  He was sitting on the sideline with tears in his eyes, trying not to cry and visibly sinking in to sadness.  He was avoiding looking at me so that he didn't melt completely in to tears, but at one point he glanced at me and I mouthed \"it's ok\" and pointed at my heart and back at him.  His coach I think noticed his change in temperment, too, and a few minutes later he was put in on defense.  I can only assume that he was told to rush the quarterback, because as soon as the ball was snapped my son forced him back 10 yards.  The next play, he did it again.  And his entire body changed after that.  He held his head up, he smiled, he started enjoying it again.\nAfter the game, I pulled him aside and said \"listen to me.  There are going to be times that you don't get the shot you think you deserve.  And in those times, you'll have 2 choices.  You can give up and stop trying, and that's ok.  You can make that choice.  But if you do that, no one will ever give you that chance again.  Or, you can choose to go back out and prove to the doubters why they should've believed in you in the first place.  And that's what you did today.  You made them see why they have to give you a chance.  Because you're worth it.\"\nToday has been discouraging, and frustrating, and a little teary on my end.  But I've replayed that conversation in my head a few times, and decided to listen to myself.\nIt's SUPER hard to start a small business, especially when you're competing with 100 other options.  But it's our job to bounce back and prove why we can't be ignored.\n\nCOMMENT 1: We have so much to learn from our kids and how we choose to guide them through life. Just know you're being an amazing example in every way, especially having the courage to start and flourish in your own business. I have a 4 and 6 year old and started 2 years ago\n\nCOMMENT 2: Love that! Also, remind the coach that Stetson Bennett didn’t get a chance to play QB either, and then won Back 2 Back Natties!"}
