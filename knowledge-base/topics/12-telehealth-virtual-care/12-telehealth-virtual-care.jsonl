For the past four years, my team and I have been able to provide pain management services to underserved and rural populations in Maryland because of telehealth. In fact, an article in MedPage Today from Nov. 27th highlighted that the rates of chronic pain have INCREASED since the onset of the opioid epidemic--from about 20% to 24%--and that healthcare SHOULD be leveraging technology to reach those who cannot access effective and appropriate care. \n\nUnless Congress intervenes in the next couple of weeks, this Medicare mandate will become permanent. Today, I am asking all of my fellow PTs, OTs, and SLPs to consider advocating for the continuance of telehealth services. Your voice DOES matter, I promise!

A few other suggestions: make the video more concise/short 11 mins is long for a potential patient to watch all the way through, wear something branded to showcase your business. Good luck!\n\nCOMMENT 2: Thank you for your service! 🇺🇸I love your mindset on exercise, inclusivity🏳️‍🌈, reaching goals of your clients! The clinic looks great! Shorter video, have a couple 1 min videos to highlight treatment areas and large gym. Hire a professional to film. Need a mic for better audio and filming needs editing. Fill the gym up with clients, friends working out, need music too. Will you have other staff? Add special effects/text in video to drive home key points, visual impact. You want to invoke emotion for action, I think most people only have attention of 1 min to get your message then they swipe. You are very brave to put yourself out there for feedback. Good luck!! 👊🏾👊🏼👊🏿"}
