Communication with the business owner (myself) (and patients at times) is also lacking outside of being at the office. I have tried counseling her in many different ways regarding the importance of up to date documentation and I’ve also suggested strategies to help her stay on top of it. She agreed in her contract with me (has been a clinician and working for me for over 3 years) to 24 hours for treatment notes, and 48 hours for evals. This is a pelvic health practice. She is also about to go on maternity leave with her first baby, so I worry greatly that if this is the situation she is in now, how will she be once she is up all night with her baby? We also have rule in TX that Evals have to be signed off by a physician within 30 days and this is putting us behind and out of compliance. \n\nShe is an AMAZING clinician and will always show up for work. She is so dependable in all these ways and I 100% trust her to give quality care to our patients.  She has a huge heart.

Communication with the business owner (myself) (and patients at times) is also lacking outside of being at the office. I have tried counseling her in many different ways regarding the importance of up to date documentation and I’ve also suggested strategies to help her stay on top of it. She agreed in her contract with me (has been a clinician and working for me for over 3 years) to 24 hours for treatment notes, and 48 hours for evals. This is a pelvic health practice. She is also about to go on maternity leave with her first baby, so I worry greatly that if this is the situation she is in now, how will she be once she is up all night with her baby? We also have rule in TX that Evals have to be signed off by a physician within 30 days and this is putting us behind and out of compliance. \n\nShe is an AMAZING clinician and will always show up for work. She is so dependable in all these ways and I 100% trust her to give quality care to our patients.  She has a huge heart. I give SO much grace and guidance, this is just very hard… but Can I with hold pay or have her not see any more patients until she is caught up?

(If allowed by the admin) could you share a link to your book?\n\nThank you! 🙏\n\nCOMMENT 1: I’m currently part of a co-author book project. \n\nWe’re working with femPower publishers in Canada (lead author is Canadian, that’s why she chose them.) It will have a unique ISBN # so it can be sold in bookstores. I don’t think you get one if you self publish, but I could be wrong. \n\nYou will 100% need to do marketing to sell a book. Pre launch, actual launch, events, etc. Books won’t sell themselves.\n\nGreg Todd is currently launching a book, you could watch his IG page and see how he’s positioning it and promoting it. He can also help you write a book I believe. \n\nGenerally, books won’t make a lot of money. Most business or thought leadership books are part of a marketing funnel for a coaching program or services.

Upon reviewing the notes on Monday, it was evident that none of the notes had charges attached and frankly, all were incomplete (e.g. no mention of skilled care, incorrect execution and interpretation of outcome measures, goals that were very poorly written). I’m reluctant to submit any of them for Medicare because they don’t meet basic documentation requirements and would rather not risk making us vulnerable to accusations of fraud or abuse. I detailed all areas of every note that need to be corrected and gave her until this evening (Tuesday) to make the corrections; however, my practice team and I are not optimistic because she acknowledged the email but otherwise we have not heard from her and the notes remain unchanged. (In the email I told her that I insisted she work with the practice manager to correct these errors, but she has not heard back from her). \n\nAny idea what my recourse is here? \nIf a therapist doesn’t complete notes, am I required to pay them? \nAnd before anyone suggests that maybe her training or support from the practice factors into this, please know that this therapist was provided with many hours of training, support, training materials, one on one meetings, offers for meetings, education… At some point the therapist just has to do their job. We can’t see the patient and document for her. (For reference she is a W2).\n\nThank you!\n\nCOMMENT 1: To make it easier on her and yourself I would tell her you are going to contact the board if she doesn't finish the notes. It will lead to a greater chance of getting the notes done.  Following through with the board thing will probably take an enormous amount of time and the notes will still be incomplete.  Best of luck\n\nCOMMENT 2: I started with holding the last paycheck until all records are turned in and I put this in their employment agreement. Not sure if its too late.\n\nAlso if she tries to claim unemployment, not completing documentation goes against company policy and thus she was fired, not eligible for unemployment. Fight it so your rates dont up."}

Any recommendations/experiences?  I think I will stay side-gig style for a while, so the 10 active patients free with Healthie looks good, and someone said it's easy to switch to another EMR since with 11+ pts it costs significantly more than the others. I am not planning to do telehealth. \n\nI am planning to use Google Workspace for my email address.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Healthie feedback:  We have used Healthie for the last 5 years in our PT mobile concierge practice and has worked well for us.  My wife and I are both PTs, with a focus on pediatrics for my wife and sports/ortho for myself.  Healthie allows us to create programs as well to host educational content for clients either for free or additional revenue streams.  The intake process is very streamlined once set up, as well as billing, invoicing, superbills, etc..  As with many EMR systems, they all seem to have idiosyncrasies that could be better at times.  Overall solid for us.\n\nCOMMENT 2: What type practice- it depends on many things- insurance? Cash? Peds? Adults?

Jane offers an introductory deal if you mention Uncaged and if you're interested in GHL Uncaged offers this and saves you a ton of money.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I want to second Jane. If you plan on growing, it is a great all-in-one platform."}

Then I go ahead and schedule them for the next week. \n\nI do this because at least one patient has some conflicting appointment that causes me to have to change their time slightly. And their appointments tend to change or get canceled. \n\nGenerally allow 30 minutes in between visits for any documentation time, if I run late, traffic etc.\n\nCOMMENT 2: 1 hour slot, 30 min travel and/or doc time."}

What do you like/dislike about it?\n\nConsidering switching to it.\n\nThank you all!\n\nCOMMENT 1: We have been with them for a year and half now, switching from WebPT and its been great. The transition process was excellent. The front office/desk portion is great (scheduling, billing, etc.). We've noticed an increase in revenue since switching as well as higher amounts of patients paying their balances, since they receive a text message and email statement. The ability to save a card on file, like a credit card or HSA card has been great as well. We can just bill the copay to that card at the end of each visit. There are so many great features, that as office manager has made my job so much easier. You can check eligibility and benefits from the EMR directly, reducing the need to use other websites and allowing for increased productivity. Spry has been great, I believe you will be very pleased with them. Customer service is friendly and fast, we typically get a response within minutes.\n\nCOMMENT 2: You'll love it. Affordable and yet has all the features we need. We love them. switched from webpt more than a year back and i thank my stars everyday i see those webpt down posts."}

Thanks!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I use PTEverywhere and it has everything I need and I added a fax line which has been handy, but it is pricey. Once I got the hang of things I felt like I could have used a cheaper platform, but uploading videos of myself explaining topics for lengthier education pieces or things I want them to view and videos of myself doing exercises is easy. I started when there was a promo where it started cheaper as you built a caseload so if you call and do a demo that could be an option. This is kind of quirky, but I actually picked it over Jane because I liked that PT was in the title and how that seemed professionally, but Jane probably uploads your logo like they do and it's not really an issue, just a preference over here.

I met some women who are writing an e-book for post-partum Moms.  More regarding depression, lactation, tongue tied infants, etc and their personal experience.  The goal would be for them to eventually monetize on this e-book.  They asked me to contribute to a chapter on pelvic health, in which it would be co written and reviewed by me, Pelvic Health Physical Therapist.  They would link my practice, my name and their IG posts to my practice.  They also plan to do webinars, with me, that would promote my clinic and some local in person sessions in the community.  \n\nNow, how should I get compensated?  \n\nThey have expressed that they are limited in funds when I asked regarding payment and the marketing would be exposure/benefit.  Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.  Thank You\n\nCOMMENT 1: I'm not sure chapter authors are paid very much...my cardiopulm PT professor told me once he was paid $300 to contribute a chapter to a text book...not sure if that is typical or not.\n\nCOMMENT 2: You usually don’t get paid to add a chapter in a book. You get to call yourself an author after this and promote it as YOUR book too. You get to give it away, sale it or whatever else you want to do with it. Many times with these kinds of books you are asked to pay to contribute. If they’re not asking for money and they have a decent following, I would do it!! It is going to open doors for you. “Hey, I’m Monica! Im a PT and local author who wrote this chapter on women’s health. I would love to leave a couple copies here for your clients to help educate them.

On Friday, I arrived to my client's home (~25 min away) that I have been seeing regularly, 2-3x/week since June, with minimal to no scheduling/cancellation issues. As I pulled into their complex, they texted me (at 11:22 for an 11:30 appt) to cancel as apparently the client was ill. I believe that to actually be the case, but wasn't given any more details besides that. I decided to enforce a small fee (less than the cancellation policy fee/session cost, because it was illness related) to cover my childcare fees as I had set up a babysitter to allow me to get to the session (which was my only session of the day) and I had already arrived. I called and explained this to the patient/spouse, and they paid, but I feel maybe were not happy about this. \n\n I am mom, and also a human and totally understand things happen! I have had clients cancel same day, several hours before due to legitimate reasons and not enforced my cancellation policy. I am curious what people do about a cancellation that occurs if you've already arrived to the client's home for a session? Do you just enforce your regular cancellation policy as if it were a no-show?

On Friday, I arrived to my client's home (~25 min away) that I have been seeing regularly, 2-3x/week since June, with minimal to no scheduling/cancellation issues. As I pulled into their complex, they texted me (at 11:22 for an 11:30 appt) to cancel as apparently the client was ill. I believe that to actually be the case, but wasn't given any more details besides that. I decided to enforce a small fee (less than the cancellation policy fee/session cost, because it was illness related) to cover my childcare fees as I had set up a babysitter to allow me to get to the session (which was my only session of the day) and I had already arrived. I called and explained this to the patient/spouse, and they paid, but I feel maybe were not happy about this. \n\n I am mom, and also a human and totally understand things happen! I have had clients cancel same day, several hours before due to legitimate reasons and not enforced my cancellation policy. I am curious what people do about a cancellation that occurs if you've already arrived to the client's home for a session? Do you just enforce your regular cancellation policy as if it were a no-show?  My clients are very committed and respectful, so I think this is a one-off, but just wanted to gain some perspective from everyone. Thank you!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Did this client know about your cancellation fee? Do you go over this when you do your initial paperwork?\n\nCOMMENT 2: Since you said that the cancellation fee/policy is in your paperwork and reviewed with the client, then I would 100% charge this. I am also mobile and if someone was to cancel with 8 minutes to go to their appt, I would charge them my full cancellation fee. The only way I wouldn't do this if it was a super extenuating circumstance, i.e. they got into a car accident on the way home from errands. From your example, this client very likely knew they were ill before 11:22am - if they woke up at 9am and felt ill, they should have notified you as early as possible.

True as that my seem; especially to those whose income and business model is married to third-party payers, there is also a growing part of healthcare clinicians may be ignoring. It is the cash-paying patient. OK, before you dismiss me, hear me out! Most insured Americans have high deductibles, making them cash patients up to 6 or 12k (whatever their deductible is). In addition, a growing part of the population is without insurance. Combined, these two groups make up 51% of Americans. So, why are we bothering to fight with insurance companies when most patients cannot use it even when they have it? Because we have always looked to insurance companies to tell us what we are worth.\nHere is the problem with processing insurance for patients with high deductibles. The overhead goes up by multiples whenever insurance companies have to put their blessing on your claim. Insurance is essential; however, it is now only for catastrophic events. Recurring healthcare should be cash-based.\nThat brings us to the how? How do you start a cash practice? Several platforms on the market can help. Because I am a clinician and a software engineer, I created a marketplace that allows all the providers and me on the platform to state what they charge and the insurances they accept. In turn, I drive patients to the platform, and they get to choose a provider based on price, insurance accepted, distance from the provider, reputation rating, etc. The platform takes the provider to the discomfort of negotiating prices with patients. Furthermore, when the patients book appointments, they pay online, so I do not have to employ an army of people to collect my money. All the providers on Hutano have told me they love how the idea of a marketplace like this saves time and money.\nOverhead is a real issue in healthcare. And it comes in two flavors, fixed and variable. Fixed overhead may be what it is. Meaning there is little you can do about it. Variable overhead, on the other hand, you can manage with technology.\nI hear healthcare is complicated more often than I can count. But is it that different from other industries? Actually, not really! Consider this; there are five essential steps to accessing and providing primary healthcare. Finding a healthcare provider, booking an appointment, completing paperwork, receiving care, and follow-up care. If we figure out how to create technology that addresses the inefficiencies in each step, we will have fixed healthcare - at least primary care.\nTraditionally, healthcare tends to mesh many technologies together and hope everything will work out. Inevitably we solve upstream problems without applying any thought to the downstream issues.\nLet me give an example. Suppose you use  Zoc Doc to automate and manage scheduling. Great! Your patients find you and book appointments efficiently. However, your waiting room is still packed with patients filling out paperwork. And yes! your patients still wait 45 minutes plus to receive care. At the end of the day, you are overwhelmed despite the efficient scheduling. So what is the solution?\nSoftware should make our lives more efficient. Unfortunately, no software on the market addresses the inefficiencies in each of the five steps. Practice management software should make finding providers and booking appointments as simple as Zoc Doc. Furthermore, patients should be able to fill out the intake, attach pertinent medical documents like imaging and lab reports, then pay for medical services online. By the time a patient walks into the clinic, the provider should be armed with all they need to diagnose and treat. But why stop there? The information a patient just entered into their intake could transfer automatically into the HPI portion of the encounter note. That way, by the time a provider starts writing a note, the patient has filled out the chief complaint, medical and social histories, medication list, preferred pharmacy, and even their vitals if that is something they can do at home. So the clinician's time can be more effectively spent interpreting the objective measures in your tests and measures, assigning a diagnosis and treatment plan. It would be great if follow-up appointments were set up in the EMR and sent directly to the patient's phone. Lastly, it would be great for any outside referrals to be managed directly in the EMR, sending referrals directly to other clinicians with access to treatment notes upon acceptance or referral.\nMy point is that technology saves time and money because; and clinicians will not need to employ people to schedule and manage appointments. Instead, like an airline, patients can book and manage their appointments.\nI created a platform three years ago that does what I just shared with you. Twelve other providers and I are on the Hutano platform, and the results have been encouraging. And, as a solo, cash-based practitioner, my time is no longer bogged down with administrative tasks. So, please visit us at Hutano.com to set up your free account, and let me know how I can help your practice be more efficient.\nAs a software engineer and clinician, I consult with other clinicians.
