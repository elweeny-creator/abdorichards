I call it weaponized incompetence. When you’re just starting you’re bound to make mistakes. \n\nYou may want to consider asking your state association if they have any advice they usually have pretty good relationships with ppl at the insurance carriers. \n\nASH tried pulling something similar with me. They told me everything was square sent over the contract however they conveniently only sent over the pages that I had to sign and left out all of the important details of the contract. Luckily I caught it and forced them to send over everything. \n\nHonestly you can probably just chalk this one up as a learning experience. Never trust anything an insurance carrier tells you and get everything in writing with reference numbers and names.\n\nCOMMENT 2: if the agreement doesn’t work for you and you can’t renegotiate, would simply not taking a referral from them works? Assuming you are working on other contracts as well."}

This post is a follow-up to a post that I made last week about offering paid wellness visits that are NOT considered PT.  I met with my lawyer today, and she told me the following facts that I thought you all might find useful:\n\n1) While it is possible (of course) to charge for this service, whether it is considered \"legally physical therapy\" or not is up to the law where the patient is present when receiving the service.  For example, If the patient is in Ontario when you performed the service (in person or over phone/video) you would be subject to laws in Ontario.  It is nearly impossible to know how each jurisdiction would behave in the event of a law violation or complaint EVERYWHERE in the world.  \n\n2)  The typical course of action of a governing board such as a state PT board to a practic act violation would be a cease and desist.  If you are sent a cease and desist, you can try to present evidence that you are NOT, in fact, violating the practice act to see if you can convince them to let you continue, or you could simply cease and desist and let it go.  They would only have you cease and desist in THEIR jurisdiction.  For example if the California state board felt that you were performing PT without a license there, they would send you a letter demanding you cease and desist what you are doing IN California.  The chances of legal repercussions or losing your license is low.\n\n3)  You need to advertise what you are doing clearly and specify how it is NOT physical therapy.  The best method to do this is to define Physical therapy as precisely as possible (I.e. performed by a licensed physical therapist, consists of an evaluation, PT diagnoses, customized goals and treatment), and then point out that your wellness program is NOT that (i.e. can be performed by a person who is NOT a licensed physical therapist, does NOT include an evaluation, PT diagnosis, or customized goals and treatment).\n\n4) My lawyer suggested having a contract for the client to sign where they agree to terms, including that they have been informed that this is not PT and will not include anything that would be considered PT or would take the place of medical treatment.  I'm sure that's not all the contract will cover, but she is writing up something formal for me.\n\n5)  Medical liability insurance may not cover a consultation like service.  You need to check with your liability insurance company about whether they would cover it, and if not you need to get general business liability insurance.\n\n6)  Keep records of visits, but those records should not look like a medical record or a Pt evaluative or treatment note in any way.\n\n7)  Treatment or advice cannot be custom unless you are referring to things other providers have already diagnosed them with/advised them of.  Example:  if a neurologist has diagnosed someone with Parkinson's, you can provide them with a general handout from the Parkinson's foundation and go over it with them.  Example 2:  If a doctor had ordered PT for this person recently, but the patient refused to go due to the time commitment as the clinic is far away, you could encourage them to go to PT and help them find a clinic that is nearer to them.\n\n8.  USE YOUR PT KNOWLEDGE to know what is considered NOT PT!  You are literally the expert witness they might call to see if someone who is claiming not to practice PT is practicing PT!  You know the definition because you are the expert.

I have a PI patient whose attorney is refusing to seek translator services because “technology is enough.”\nThis patient had a consult with an ortho that refers to me and he said it was a disaster with communication because nothing was translating over correctly (Korean to English and vice versa). He actually told the attorney he cannot see this patient unless an actual interpreter is present and has not heard back.\nWondering if I should do the same or if anyone has had success utilizing it?\n\nCOMMENT 1: This is a title VI issue. \n\nYou are actually required by law to provide a qualified translator for this patient. Google translate it chat GPT or even a family member of the patient would not meet the requirement. In the event a translator is not provided, the patient could sue for discrimination. In the event of a poor outcome or injury, the patient could sue claiming negligence... which makes sense really. You can't treat without an eval and you can't really evaluate properly f you can't communicate.\n\nThe big sticker here is who pays for the translator. I've had to eat the cost when the Medicare is the payer since they won't reimburse for it.\n\nYou can Google and see some legal precedent. Off the top of my mind I can recall a case where an OBGYN was sued for discrimination for not providing an interpreter and another where an ER doctor was sued because a family member of the patient mistranslated something which led to delayed treatment and poor outcome.\n\nCOMMENT 2: Comprehend Health is an AI medical scribe that works with over 57 languages.

The agent also said it covered everything that \" a PT could do via their practice act for the State I was practicing in,\" and that it would cover me and the business at this time and any secretarial or other admins that currently are apart of or will be apart of the company. But I'd have to change to a group plan once I add more clinicians. Okay, that makes sense to me. \n\nMy question is, after reading some posts- what am I missing- as I see some indicating a general plan and a professional insurance? Would I need an additional plan for malpractice insurance? I was ways under the impression CMF was malpractice insurance.\n\nCOMMENT 1: This stuff is clear as mud because they don't just call it malpractice insurance, which I wish they would.

I use Mercer/Proliability for one of my OT small businesses, but I am in the process of setting up a second business with a PT partner. This second business will be only for online educational content (online courses) marketed to the general public (not to other practitioners, or at least not yet). I am really having some struggles with Mercer on getting set up with liability insurance and have been told SO many different things depending on what day I call. Does anyone have a business that has more than 1 business owner, and primarily or only does online courses (not direct therapy services)? It seems weird to pay the same amount that I do for a service-based business when this other business really only needs the educational or non-direct care rider, if that makes sense. Surely someone else out there does this!!!
