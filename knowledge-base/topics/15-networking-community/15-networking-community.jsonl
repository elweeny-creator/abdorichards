At first, Josh Payne, David Bayliff and myself wanted to \"stay in our lane\" and focus on coaching and mentorship but this changes NOW. \n\nThis group has evolved and grown through the last several years and although the growth is exciting, it's also very sad that the level of satisfaction and fulfillment in healthcare seems to be plummeting. \n\nWe all have our thoughts on why this is the case but we're all fighting in isolation and lack a common voice and space for grassroots change and growth. \n\nWill we \"fix\" healthcare in the US? probably not, but the goal that we have is to unify the voices of PTs, OTs, SLPs, and more and stop the infighting that keeps us from collective growth. \n\nIn order to bring us more together, we're launching a community platform and app that focuses on clinical and business development, resourcing clinicians, mentorship, collaboration, accountability, and community and we want YOU to be a part of it. \n\nYes this will take time and yes there will be some kinks that need to be ironed out but we need a group of clinicians who are willing to be trailblazers with us to help move this mission forward. \n\nAll that being said, we are hosting an EXCLUSIVE training and launch party on March 22nd at 8:00 pm eastern to teach you, motivate you, and show you what we've been working on. \n\nSpaces in the training are limited and spaces for the trailblazers on the app are going to be limited as we continue to grow and launch this to more and more people! \n\nRegister using the link below and give this post some love because we want to make sure everyone in this group knows that we're on a mission to unify voices in our fields and reinvigorate the passion that you once had for loving, serving, caring, and leading others in healthcare.\n\nCOMMENT 1: So pumped!! This is going to change the game for our profession and healthcare as a whole\n\nCOMMENT 2: Let’s GO Uncaged Clinicians!!

I feel busy, but what I am doing is holding space for tasks that won’t move me forward and missing opportunities that could… self sabotage is real and this is my limiting belief… “being busy will get me to my goals”. I’ve been lying to myself for the past 30-40 years and have limited myself dramatically.  This year will be different.  \n\nI refuse to allow myself to be held back and kill my dreams… I am working through my limiting beliefs and making changes to fix myself.  Saying no to things is the first thing I am changing. Let this year be YOUR year to make amazing changes so that all your dreams can come true and you can change your life.\n\nCOMMENT 1: PAL-You-bin!!!\nI have no doubt you have got this!!!\n\nYou have come so far, I’ve seen it!\nThis is just a valley you’re in right now… look everywhere for the light, the light that gets you going …truly gets you going… not the easy superficial stuff… the stuff you know deep down inside is hard, but simultaneously lights your fire …. \nI’m here rooting for you and if you need an 👂 \n😘❤️😘❤️\nRemember: the fear is feeding you false information, telling you all sorts of bullshit about yourself… stop listening… it’s not helping you at all!!!   \n“And ….we’re walkin’…” Denver Live event 🤣😘\n\nCOMMENT 2: Big goals require big help and big faith. Keep reaching out, keep plugging in to community, and keep God at the front of it all.\n\nGod is not surprised by anything you do, or anything the world throws at you."}

Somehow, at every turn, another boatman had my back. This stuff is not easy. \nIt's very technical. \nSometimes it's extremely hot. \nSometimes there are storms that bring thundering flash floods. \nSometimes other people get stuck on the rocks and we have to help pull them off.\n\nAll of that feels extremely similar when I have random employment questions or regulatory or billing questions. The other 'guides' on our trip are incredibly positive as they rally with each other so we all get down safely.\n\nThere is an amazing community experience down in the Grand Canyon! There are also amazing communities here in Uncaged, with the Private Practice Section and with the other associations we have out there.  \n\nThanks to everyone for looking out for each other! What a cool thing to be a part of!"}
