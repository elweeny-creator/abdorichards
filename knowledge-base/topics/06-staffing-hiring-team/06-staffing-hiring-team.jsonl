I’m seeking advice regarding staffing and feedback. \nI’ve been uncaged for 4 years. I am to the point I can afford a tech nearly 30-40 hours a week. I’ve hired a tech who does an amazing job. He’s been with me for 9 months. He’s young, early 20s, has some technical school background, training for EMT. I do wound care. He assists w/patient care, scribing, ordering/stocking, cleaning, anything else needed. He’s very flexible and easy going. Very thorough and good at his job. After months of training, he is very familiar with our process, rarely needs corrected with work. Early on I had to correct him about professionalism (chewing tobacco and eating in front of patients), and he responded immediately and we haven’t had another issue. He has underlying anxiety (goes to counseling) so im careful giving feedback, but overall, he’s great!  About two weeks ago, I told him he didnt needed to stay late, but he chose to, then politely left mid treatment. Later he sent a text apologizing, saying he needed a break, he was getting burned out. We had 3 crazy evals that day, and when the pt dumped the colostomy bag, he was over it. Rightfully so. We also had 9 more evals than average that month (75% increase). It’s just the two of us. No front desk, so he was doing that too. A front desk person started this week. \n\nMy issue is he has a habit of picking at his face. He will pick the scabs, look at them and flick them or throw them down. It’s all day. I am a freak about being clean, especially given what we do. He’s in every treatment w/me. About a month ago, he flicked it toward my treatment table (not on it) and I immediately addressed it after the treatment. I explained it would be good if he didn’t pick at his face as much and I explained my concern regarding the event that happened. He was apologetic and surprised when I pointed out his scab was directed at my treatment table, unintentionally of course. Unlike all of our other professionalism talks, not much changed except he doesnt flick them anymore. This week, as I was teaching him on my computer, he dropped a scab on my keyboard. He brushed it away. I was so upset by this, I didn’t say anything (which was best w/my personality). \n\nI feel I need to address this. My family doesn’t do this, so I dont really understand it. Im trying to decide how to approach this for the second time, assuming I should. I do not want to upset him. He does so much for our clinic. I’m concerned it’s a nervous habit and he’s going to have a hard time stopping. If I’m over reacting, I’m open to hear feedback. I know everyone is different. Maybe other people are like this and I don’t notice b/c Im not with them all day. Regardless, the feedback here has always been helpful. I’m open to all thoughts, opinions, and/or what you would do.

Here’s a rundown of essential considerations:\n\n1. Independent Contractor Classification: Make sure she meets the requirements for a 1099 contractor, not a W-2 employee. This means she should have flexibility in how and when she works, supply some of her own equipment, and take on some business risks (like travel expenses).\n\n2. Insurance: Yes, you’ll want her to carry her own liability insurance. It’s still a good idea to confirm this with your own insurer, as they might require you to list contractors for full coverage. Having clear documentation of her liability coverage can help protect both of you.\n\n3. Contract Specifics: Make sure your contract covers:\n\nPayment Terms: Outline the percentage per visit, any reimbursement for travel, and payment timelines.\n\nConfidentiality and HIPAA Compliance: Since she’s using your EMR, include specific language about HIPAA compliance and patient data security.\n\nNon-compete or Non-solicitation Clauses: Decide if you want any limitations around her working with your clients independently.\n\n4. EMR Access and Compliance: Ensure she’s trained on your EMR and understands your documentation standards. Since she’s using your system, emphasize that she adheres to the same security measures you do.\n\n5. Equipment: If she’s responsible for her own equipment, be clear about what is needed to fulfill the job (e.g., laptop, mobile device, therapy tools) and ensure this is in writing. Anything you provide would technically be taxable, so it’s easier for her to provide her own if she can.\n\n6. Payroll and Taxes: If she's a 1099 contractor, you won’t withhold taxes for her, but make sure to issue her a 1099-NEC at the end of the year for tax purposes. Keep detailed payment records to help her accurately report her income.\n\n7. Worker’s Compensation: While 1099 contractors typically aren’t covered by worker’s comp, it’s worth checking your state’s requirements, as some have specific regulations for certain industries.\n\n8. Clear Communication: Especially with your first hire, be proactive in setting up regular check-ins to make sure everything is running smoothly.

I expect to be booked at 20 for next at least 4-5 weeks… with likely waitlist. \nI am ok keeping 20 + 18 units of HH for a month or 2, but not much longer. I also need to give 4 weeks notice at HH to cash my PTO.\nSo question is, at what point it is “safe” to call it quit on the HH side?\nI am scared of calling it on HH and then suddenly go back to 12 sessions a week in a few months\n\nCOMMENT 1: If you're really worried stay on with home health but as a PRN employee or an independent contractor. You don't want to sacrifice your business for home health and it sounds like you have some really good opportunities. Plus word of mouth is huge! It's how I get a lot of my returning patients\n\nCOMMENT 2: Great job! You are clearly doing an amazing job! I would go atleast another 90 days with your HH and Brick and mortar and then resign with the 4 week notice from HH. Worse case scenario you switch to prn with HH and or sign up with another prn company in the event you’re unable to fill your brick and mortar caseload."}

Running with a metronome can help with over-striding—when you’re floppy it’s easy to over-stride, and this can place more load on the distal musculature on impact. A metronome can help you maintain a cadence and keep some co-contraction of agonists/antagonists (particularly the hips) to keep a more stable proximal base. I use a cadence of somewhere between 160-180 bpm, there are playlists on Spotify that particularly cater to these bpm’s. Hope this helps!\n\nCOMMENT 2: I don’t have any advice about running, but I did a hiking R2R a few years ago in September when I was 45 (2 nights at Phantom Ranch so only carried a day pack.)  My 2 cents- the time I put in going up and down the stadium stairs at my local high school wearing my loaded pack that summer was the most beneficial training I did. If you haven’t joined them already, there are R2R and R2R2R fb groups that offer lots of great advice for first-timers. Good luck with your training and enjoy the canyon- there are definitely moments when you need to “embrace the suck” but it is an amazing experience 😊"}

I am not looking for a job, but I was reading the description thinking how it sounded like a great opportunity for someone.  And then the last line.  Masters or Doctorate degree required.  My comment to him and something for you to think about if you are looking to hire a therapist:\n-------\n\"This makes me sad to that you are looking only for Masters or Doctorate therapists. I saw a job posting for a company recently that was looking for a Masters \"or better.\" How extremely offensive to older therapists who went to school before PTs were required to be Masters/Doctorate level and so they have a \"just have a BS.\" You could have someone with years of experience with various certifications who could meet all of those other requirements and you aren't willing to even consider them? You think they aren't smart enough? Are you being \"ageist\" and thinking they are \"old\" and you assume they won't match your \"vibe.\" Actually, it doesn't make me sad. It makes me mad. How rude. And, yes, I \"just have a B.S.\"\n-------\nThis mindset is alienating to people who could maybe be the best employees you have ever had.  I know some amazing therapists who only have a B.S.  If you require a MPT or DPT, you have indicated a BSPT is not good enough for you.  In that case, hopefully you have an abundance of Masters/Doctorate level therapists in your area and you won't have to end up settling for a BSPT (who is a Physical Therapist who graduated from an accredited school and passed a licensure exam just like you) as you apparently don't respect them.  And who wants to be on a team when they are looked down upon as inferior because they are defined by their degree and not the experience they have to bring to the table?\n\nYes, a nerve was touched this morning.", "comments": [{"text": "I graduated with BSPT 1999. Had to go back to tDPT for several reasons, one is for immigration purposes, second to keep up with newer graduates. Third, I needed the CEU and it counts towards your CEU requirements anyway. Why would a company hire a foreign trained short Filipino good looking guy versus a new younger US trained DPT. I had to compete, I had to be at par with the new graduates. They aren't just going to hire me because of my looks and physically fit body. Just kidding. 😁😁😁\n\nKidding aside, US immigration itself discriminates, they won't let us practice without having DPT degree now (or at least a master's level). So it's not just employers who do this. Immigration, even patients looks for the letter DR when they looks us up. \n\nWith that being said, I prefer experienced therapists over new graduates, but we also have to give a chance to the younger up and coming new generation. They will be the future of this profession and need to be supported too. \n\nAnd as a clinic owner who hires DPTs, RPT, MsPT, PTA, OTR etc. I have a 60 something year old PT and a 26 year old new grad PTA. \n\nAs long as you have the necessary license and appropriate fair salary expectations and know how to take care and treat my patients.

I am not looking for a job, but I was reading the description thinking how it sounded like a great opportunity for someone.  And then the last line.  Masters or Doctorate degree required.  My comment to him and something for you to think about if you are looking to hire a therapist:\n-------\n\"This makes me sad to that you are looking only for Masters or Doctorate therapists. I saw a job posting for a company recently that was looking for a Masters \"or better.\" How extremely offensive to older therapists who went to school before PTs were required to be Masters/Doctorate level and so they have a \"just have a BS.\" You could have someone with years of experience with various certifications who could meet all of those other requirements and you aren't willing to even consider them? You think they aren't smart enough? Are you being \"ageist\" and thinking they are \"old\" and you assume they won't match your \"vibe.\" Actually, it doesn't make me sad. It makes me mad. How rude. And, yes, I \"just have a B.S.\"\n-------\nThis mindset is alienating to people who could maybe be the best employees you have ever had.  I know some amazing therapists who only have a B.S.  If you require a MPT or DPT, you have indicated a BSPT is not good enough for you.  In that case, hopefully you have an abundance of Masters/Doctorate level therapists in your area and you won't have to end up settling for a BSPT (who is a Physical Therapist who graduated from an accredited school and passed a licensure exam just like you) as you apparently don't respect them.  And who wants to be on a team when they are looked down upon as inferior because they are defined by their degree and not the experience they have to bring to the table?\n\nYes, a nerve was touched this morning.\n\nCOMMENT 1: I graduated with BSPT 1999. Had to go back to tDPT for several reasons, one is for immigration purposes, second to keep up with newer graduates. Third, I needed the CEU and it counts towards your CEU requirements anyway. Why would a company hire a foreign trained short Filipino good looking guy versus a new younger US trained DPT. I had to compete, I had to be at par with the new graduates. They aren't just going to hire me because of my looks and physically fit body. Just kidding. 😁😁😁\n\nKidding aside, US immigration itself discriminates, they won't let us practice without having DPT degree now (or at least a master's level). So it's not just employers who do this. Immigration, even patients looks for the letter DR when they looks us up. \n\nWith that being said, I prefer experienced therapists over new graduates, but we also have to give a chance to the younger up and coming new generation. They will be the future of this profession and need to be supported too. \n\nAnd as a clinic owner who hires DPTs, RPT, MsPT, PTA, OTR etc. I have a 60 something year old PT and a 26 year old new grad PTA. \n\nAs long as you have the necessary license and appropriate fair salary expectations and know how to take care and treat my patients. Why not.  Let's get you onboard. 😃😃😃\n\nGood luck! And I am going to find the Michael Jackson meme with popcorn now. 😁😁😁\n\nCOMMENT 2: I agree with your point. Let the interview tease out desired skill sets for the position. I know BSPT's that are very progressive, have stayed current with research and are some of the best in our field. I know some old tired lazy therapists too.  I got my tDPT in 2013 because I knew agism and marginalization of BSPT's would happen.  This MS or DPT only is in most job postings these day.

You are in high demand and you shouldn't feel bad about that, not for one second! Make sure your front desk handles it with Grace and with empathy but also not with shame. If you give the perspective that you are doing something wrong by not getting everyone in the door right away, the takeaway will be a negative. Flip it so that the wait list is a positive and one that creates further desire for the patient to want to wait"}
