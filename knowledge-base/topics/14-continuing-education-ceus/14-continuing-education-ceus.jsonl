Because the group exercise classes I’ve taken more structured around splitting up ability levels which 1) doesn’t work for chronic conditions like PD and the other Neuro dx I enjoy working with whose abilities can change on the daily and 2) that rubs my DEI(inclusion) training the wrong way.

Any advice welcome, any classes or CEUs I’m very interested in! I’m a PWR moves certified PT so I want to feel more comfortable structuring group exercise for people with Parkinson’s 🙌🏻\n\nCOMMENT 1: Taking exercise classes yourself can give you ideas about structure, scaling, intensity, variety etc.  I participate in a small group strengthening program myself and now run three groups for 55+. I add more agility, balance and scaling options with my PT experience.\nI also follow the Modern Management of the Older Adult section of ICE. They have great social media, podcast and cont ed content.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I’ve done a couple courses from varying sources from the type of class I want to lead. (In the process of putting together a business plan.) What I find challenging is the variety of abilities that I’m *hoping* will show up to class and making it fun but challenging for everyone from an athlete to couch potato to wheelchair user. Because the group exercise classes I’ve taken more structured around splitting up ability levels which 1) doesn’t work for chronic conditions like PD and the other Neuro dx I enjoy working with whose abilities can change on the daily and 2) that rubs my DEI(inclusion) training the wrong way. So not sure how that will go until I dive in, but hoping my PT brain will serve there 😅\n\nAs others have mentioned, every course I’ve taken recommends making an outline to follow. So maybe I’ll just flesh out the outline with options to increase and decrease the intensity."}

We wanted to make sure you got answers, so that you don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to learn from the coaches at Uncaged Clinician:\n\n 1) How long will I have access to the recordings?\n\nA: Forever. On Tuesday, November 1st every person who has signed up for bootcamp will get access on their Kajabi accounts where the training recordings will be uploaded. That is evergreen and you will always have access to them in your account!\n\n 2) Will I get LESS value out of the bootcamp if I can't be present for the live trainings?\n\nNo, not at all. Each Training will be a 60 minute training led by Josh Payne on the topics. Then, that will be followed by a 30 minute Q&A. Most questions asked will be directly relatable to you as the majority of clinicians in bootcamp are in the same spot of just starting up their business.\n\n 3) Would you recommend reading another book or listening to some podcasts before registering for bootcamp?\n\nDefinitely not! The bootcamp is all of the information that you need to get started with your practice effectively. Remember: The answer isn't always MORE information, but rather how you are implementing the information. Bootcamp gives you all of the information you need AND the implementable steps necessary to take action on the information. \n\n It's TIME to take action and set yourself and your business up for success! \n\nOur team is geared up and ready to help you starting on Tuesday night 👊🏻\n\nLink below to sign up ⬇️", "comments": [{"text": "CAN.

We wanted to make sure you got answers, so that you don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to learn from the coaches at Uncaged Clinician:\n\n 1) How long will I have access to the recordings?\n\nA: Forever. On Tuesday, November 1st every person who has signed up for bootcamp will get access on their Kajabi accounts where the training recordings will be uploaded. That is evergreen and you will always have access to them in your account!\n\n 2) Will I get LESS value out of the bootcamp if I can't be present for the live trainings?\n\nNo, not at all. Each Training will be a 60 minute training led by Josh Payne on the topics. Then, that will be followed by a 30 minute Q&A. Most questions asked will be directly relatable to you as the majority of clinicians in bootcamp are in the same spot of just starting up their business.\n\n 3) Would you recommend reading another book or listening to some podcasts before registering for bootcamp?\n\nDefinitely not! The bootcamp is all of the information that you need to get started with your practice effectively. Remember: The answer isn't always MORE information, but rather how you are implementing the information. Bootcamp gives you all of the information you need AND the implementable steps necessary to take action on the information. \n\n It's TIME to take action and set yourself and your business up for success! \n\nOur team is geared up and ready to help you starting on Tuesday night 👊🏻\n\nLink below to sign up ⬇️\n\nCOMMENT 1: CAN. NOT. WAIT.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I have a question. I see that going over legal issues is included in the training. Does this include helping to develop a HIPPA p and p?"}

I practice in MD but went to school in Cali so I’m somewhat familiar with the practice act there. I would say this is mostly a liability issue. We can never truly take our “PT hat” off even when training folks/ teaching group exercise. However, it does help to have a separate cert to help distinguish those services from your other PT work. So I’d suggest getting a NASM CPT or CSCS depending on your population.
