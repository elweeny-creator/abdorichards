Like you're just a cog in the healthcare machine instead of the impactful provider you trained to be?\n\nYou’re *not* alone—and you’re *not* stuck. 💡\n\nIn this week’s episode of **Uncaged Clinician**, we sit down with Lesli Jenkins, an occupational therapist who broke free from burnout and built a successful mobile lymphedema/oncology practice in the Fort Worth-Dallas area.\n\nLesli’s story is REAL, relatable, and ridiculously inspiring. 💪\nShe shares what it took to go from disillusioned to thriving—and how YOU can create a business that reflects your values, skills, and worth.\n\n🎧 In this episode, we dive into:\n✅ The harsh reality of burnout in OT\n✅ Why so many OTs feel like outsiders in their own field\n✅ The *entrepreneurial superpower* most OTs don’t realize they have\n✅ How Lesli built her mobile practice from scratch\n✅ Collaborating with other healthcare providers while staying true to your OT roots\n✅ Encouragement for clinicians ready to take one bold step toward freedom\n\n💥 As Lesli says, “You have the ability to create whatever environment you want to thrive in.”\nLet that sink in.\n\nThis episode is a must-listen if you’re ready to take your first (or next) step toward owning your time, income, and impact.\n\n🎙️ Listen now ➡️ [Podcast link in the comments]\n\n🙌 Found this inspiring?

Like you're just a cog in the healthcare machine instead of the impactful provider you trained to be?\n\nYou’re *not* alone—and you’re *not* stuck. 💡\n\nIn this week’s episode of **Uncaged Clinician**, we sit down with Lesli Jenkins, an occupational therapist who broke free from burnout and built a successful mobile lymphedema/oncology practice in the Fort Worth-Dallas area.\n\nLesli’s story is REAL, relatable, and ridiculously inspiring. 💪\nShe shares what it took to go from disillusioned to thriving—and how YOU can create a business that reflects your values, skills, and worth.\n\n🎧 In this episode, we dive into:\n✅ The harsh reality of burnout in OT\n✅ Why so many OTs feel like outsiders in their own field\n✅ The *entrepreneurial superpower* most OTs don’t realize they have\n✅ How Lesli built her mobile practice from scratch\n✅ Collaborating with other healthcare providers while staying true to your OT roots\n✅ Encouragement for clinicians ready to take one bold step toward freedom\n\n💥 As Lesli says, “You have the ability to create whatever environment you want to thrive in.”\nLet that sink in.\n\nThis episode is a must-listen if you’re ready to take your first (or next) step toward owning your time, income, and impact.\n\n🎙️ Listen now ➡️ [Podcast link in the comments]\n\n🙌 Found this inspiring? Hit *Share* and tag a fellow OT who needs to hear this.

Is it though, really?\nThat’s what I wrestle with on a daily basis. I’m currently working full-time in large hospital. It’s standard corporate healthcare, with all of the usual BS. I like my job, though. I get paid relatively well (or so I think). No weekends, no holidays. My patients love me, and I love them. I am a parent of young kids. I value my time more than anything. I like that I don’t have to think about work when I finally come home at night. And yet, I still struggle with the “what if?”… what if I’m missing out on something? Would becoming Uncaged and breaking out on my own make me happier? Would it make me lonelier, not constantly being around coworkers? Would it mess with my mental health? Would it steal my time away from my kids? Does anyone regret going out on their own? I’m sure there are many opinions out there, and maybe this group is inherently biased towards breaking out, but I’m curious and would love honest feedback.\n\nCOMMENT 1: \"I value my time more than anything\", is what you wrote. My perspective is this - my business is my 3rd child. The nice thing? I have flexibility over my schedule when the first borns need me. The hard part? The 3rd child always needs attention to! 🙂\n\nCOMMENT 2: Based on everything you said - stay where you are. If/when you start hating your job and you want more schedule flexibility and more control of how you treat your patients in order to eventually get paid more to do less, then branch out. But right now…. Stay put my friend! Business is not easy, especially at first. I was lonelier for sure. I’m eager to get back into a team setting at some point, but would only ever join a primary care practice."}

And it does! \n-if you Create processes, check boxes, quotas or productivity percentages to be reached, they will always will tell us what we want to hear, but it may not be telling us the truth\n-when leaders choose to implement processes and demands (like productivity rather than clinical judgment), The opportunity for systemic ethical fading persist, especially if these demands are not only unreasonable but are OUTRIGHT impossible. \n-pressure comes from the top down (director of rehab telling you what to do) but also pressure comes from the bottom up (in an effort to stand out, new grads/those looking for a raise/brown nosers want to appear they can do everything, so they work off the clock or provide fraudulent therapy to reach productivity) and a failure to do these bad things makes others look bad. Submitting a false report helps the system run smoothly and keeps their careers on track. Because the punishment for being honest is greater than for Lies, (therapist) feel they have to lie or cheat to meet the requirements placed upon them. It’s a catch 22. They will do this while believing that their high moral standards have remained uncompromised. They don’t see this as unethical or lying, they see it as part of the bureaucratic process of checking the boxes, just doing what leader ship wanted them to do. \n-When these seemingly minor transgressions become pervasive in a culture, it is a sign of ethical fading!\n-the irony is that when we apply finite related solutions to address a problem of ethical fading, that finite minded thinking created, we get more ethical fading. When we use processes and structure to fix cultural problems, we get more lying and cheating, then the behavior becomes normalized. \n-calling someone a lazy leader is not calling them a bad person just like calling someone a lazy person who doesn’t want to exercise doesn’t mean they’re a bad person. Their decisions are often very well intended.

And it does! \n-if you Create processes, check boxes, quotas or productivity percentages to be reached, they will always will tell us what we want to hear, but it may not be telling us the truth\n-when leaders choose to implement processes and demands (like productivity rather than clinical judgment), The opportunity for systemic ethical fading persist, especially if these demands are not only unreasonable but are OUTRIGHT impossible. \n-pressure comes from the top down (director of rehab telling you what to do) but also pressure comes from the bottom up (in an effort to stand out, new grads/those looking for a raise/brown nosers want to appear they can do everything, so they work off the clock or provide fraudulent therapy to reach productivity) and a failure to do these bad things makes others look bad. Submitting a false report helps the system run smoothly and keeps their careers on track. Because the punishment for being honest is greater than for Lies, (therapist) feel they have to lie or cheat to meet the requirements placed upon them. It’s a catch 22. They will do this while believing that their high moral standards have remained uncompromised. They don’t see this as unethical or lying, they see it as part of the bureaucratic process of checking the boxes, just doing what leader ship wanted them to do. \n-When these seemingly minor transgressions become pervasive in a culture, it is a sign of ethical fading!\n-the irony is that when we apply finite related solutions to address a problem of ethical fading, that finite minded thinking created, we get more ethical fading. When we use processes and structure to fix cultural problems, we get more lying and cheating, then the behavior becomes normalized. \n-calling someone a lazy leader is not calling them a bad person just like calling someone a lazy person who doesn’t want to exercise doesn’t mean they’re a bad person. Their decisions are often very well intended. They actually believe these demands are going to be helpful but because leadership never experiences these demands they’re oblivious to the problems they create. \n-More structure is not the answer! \n-ethical fading  is a People problem and we need PEOPLE to correct a People problem\n-THE ANSWER is an infinite mind set\n-leaders who give their staff a just cause to advance, and give them a trusting TEAM, Will build a culture in which their people can work toward the STG while staying ethical, NOT because they are told to, NOT because they have a checklist that requires it, NOT because they took the companies online course, they did it because it’s the natural human thing to do. \n-my input…\n-leadership should let their SNF therapists know that if they let their productivity dip below 90% because it was ethically correct to take time to talk to a family member or doctor which is non-productive time, the company may not have enough money to support raises or other employee request this year but if they also support the just cause of “ let’s help our seniors age in place and keep them as mobile and healthy as we possibly can” by selling more 1:1 gym training or wellness programs, we can fund more employee request!
