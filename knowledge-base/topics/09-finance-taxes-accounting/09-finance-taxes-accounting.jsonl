Anyone have recommendations for financial advisors or resources willing to advise on student loans?\n\nBefore opening my biz I was at a non-profit and 4 years into a PSLF plan (it was the major mental hurdle to jumping ship and doing my own thing). Between that and COVID, I’ve been on this IDR plan making minimal payments for a while.\n\nNow I’m 3+ years into business and I’ve tripled my previous salary but haven’t quite figured out the approach to the loans. Still technically on an IDR plan and paying the minimum which would theoretically be forgiven in 12 years.\n\nI usually pay my debt aggresively (or dont carry it)but also understand basic math and see that I’d pay FAR less over the life of the loan if I were to keep paying the minimum another 12 years vs aggressively paying down over 200K in debt with $ I could invest into scaling my biz.\n\nOur financial advisor doesn’t understand the world of loans and doesn’t trust the government to forgive so he has been minimally helpful and the loan servicers/government are useless on this.    \n\nIf anyone can speak to this or has a recommended resource please let me know or DM me!\n\nCOMMENT 1: If your non profit service was specifically to get your loans forgiven that is reasonable. But otherwise, you took out loans, you should pay them back. If you have an IDF plan and you 3x your income, you need to recalculate that payment anyway. This a more personal matter but if you take out loans, you should be the one to pay them back, not the tax payer. Obviously I don't know all you situation but you did ask facebook so here's my 2c. Congrats on going out on a limb and succeeding with your business!\n\nCOMMENT 2: Following. Had a few planners look at my debt vs income and % of return if I were to invest in the market. Given the % rates of my loans and volatility of the market, even playing it safe, the advisors ultimately concluded it maybe a wash and best advised to pay off as quick as possible, versus carrying debt.
