Medicare confuses me, is this a 👍🏿 or 👎🏿, thanks\n\nCOMMENT 1: The simple guideline is you can't take cash from some one with Medicare for medically necessary services, other than the 20% co-insurance patient responsibility (assuming they don't have a secondary) or their deductible if it's unpaid. \n\nIf you've done an evaluation and determined that services are not medically necessary/don't require the skills of a PT, then you can create and charge for a wellness program. \n\nPT's cannot opt out of Medicare like medical providers can.\n\nDocument the heck out of it and assess your own risk tolerance. \n\nAccording to a number of individuals, there are very specific methods to try to work around this for medically necessary services. If you're asking this question here, and have not set yourself up with good legal advice for those ways, you don't want to consider them."}

May not be paid for your evaluation and treatment before the start of authorization.\n\nCOMMENT 2: We work with BCBS in WI and when pre-auth is required we need to request it as the treating therapist/facility. The information usually includes clinical information like an outcome measure, which the PCP wouldn’t be able to provide. I’ve never heard of retro authorization, but if you are planning to continue to see the client you might be able to request authorization now for future visits."}

I was speaking to a local chiropractor (I am a physical therapist looking to launch my own business) she was telling me…\n\n“she believes as a licensed healthcare provider you will need to register with CMS/Medicare in order to treat any patients.  That you can register as a Non-par provider and should be allowed to accept cash from a Medicare patients. Charges must “be in alignment with customary & reasonable for your region”.  I guess this has something to do with discrimination practices.  But I guess that’s the Medicare handcuffs, because Medicare patients are allowed to request reimbursement from Medicare and/or deduct medical expenses from their taxes which they are required to receive legit services from licensed practitioners blah, blah.  So bottom line, whether or not you bill/charge/submit to Medicare or not, you have to register with them as a non-par provider.” \n\nFrom what I can tell for physical therapist, the only way I could see a Medicare patient for cash if it’s truly a “wellness” session.

I've been a Medicare provider (PT) for over 5 years, and this local chiropractor is a bit off base! Sounds like she is trying to explain to you what a Non-par provider is. Basically, you need to enroll with Medicare if you want to treat Medicare patients and submit claims. You can enroll as either participating or non-participating provider (confusing, right??!) Non-par does not mean you have no relationship with Medicare, you cannot accept cash (self-pay) from a Medicare patient as a Non-par provider. I would recommend checking out Tony Anthony Maritatos Facebook Group Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group. I've found it very helpful with navigating the Medicare maze 🙂 \nYou are correct, you can see Medicare patients as self-pay/ \"cash\" for wellness visits, if skilled PT is not necessary.

I was speaking to a local chiropractor (I am a physical therapist looking to launch my own business) she was telling me…\n\n“she believes as a licensed healthcare provider you will need to register with CMS/Medicare in order to treat any patients.  That you can register as a Non-par provider and should be allowed to accept cash from a Medicare patients. Charges must “be in alignment with customary & reasonable for your region”.  I guess this has something to do with discrimination practices.  But I guess that’s the Medicare handcuffs, because Medicare patients are allowed to request reimbursement from Medicare and/or deduct medical expenses from their taxes which they are required to receive legit services from licensed practitioners blah, blah.  So bottom line, whether or not you bill/charge/submit to Medicare or not, you have to register with them as a non-par provider.” \n\nFrom what I can tell for physical therapist, the only way I could see a Medicare patient for cash if it’s truly a “wellness” session. But do I need to register as this “non-par provider”? I am in Illinois if that makes a difference!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Hi, Katherine Reinertson Wood thanks for asking this. I've been a Medicare provider (PT) for over 5 years, and this local chiropractor is a bit off base! Sounds like she is trying to explain to you what a Non-par provider is. Basically, you need to enroll with Medicare if you want to treat Medicare patients and submit claims. You can enroll as either participating or non-participating provider (confusing, right??!) Non-par does not mean you have no relationship with Medicare, you cannot accept cash (self-pay) from a Medicare patient as a Non-par provider. I would recommend checking out Tony Anthony Maritatos Facebook Group Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group. I've found it very helpful with navigating the Medicare maze 🙂 \nYou are correct, you can see Medicare patients as self-pay/ \"cash\" for wellness visits, if skilled PT is not necessary. No need to register with Medicare, par or non-par, to do wellness visits. Hope that helps!\n\nCOMMENT 2: There are 3 categories:\n- affiliated with Medicare, Participating\n- affiliated with Medicare, non-Participating\n- no affiliation\n\nIf you are not affiliated you cannot treat anything that would be reimbursable under Medicare for PT. Non-medically necessary items (such as wellness), can be cash billed."}

I have a personal question but figured people here would be most knowledgeable. Can we bill for indirect care? I was under the impression we cannot as it’s not direct contact. I‘m in California.\n\nBackground:\nIm taking my kid to a multidisciplinary peds center (offering PT, OT, SLP) and they gave me the following information. They’re charging me for notes? We’re also only getting one therapy service and won’t have a team. \n\nEdit: They are in-network with my PPO and accept other insurance. No Medicaid, I don’t know about Medicare \n\n“Examples of indirect care include meetings where members of the child’s treatment team discussed the child’s progress in their treatment plan, as well as the creation of progress reports. If the child’s treatment program is funded by a program that allows us to bill for indirect care, then the client is not responsible for the cost-share associated with indirect care. However, if they do not cover indirect care ** Therapy will bill you directly.\nThe explanation of benefits (EOB) that you receive from your insurance provider may shows that they had paid for dates of service where the client did not have any direct interaction with the treatment team. If a client’s insurance benefit is canceled and the client does not inform ** Therapy of the benefit cancellation, then the client or legal guardian will be responsible for payment of the direct and indirect care that is not covered by the insurance provider.

I have a personal question but figured people here would be most knowledgeable. Can we bill for indirect care? I was under the impression we cannot as it’s not direct contact. I‘m in California.\n\nBackground:\nIm taking my kid to a multidisciplinary peds center (offering PT, OT, SLP) and they gave me the following information. They’re charging me for notes? We’re also only getting one therapy service and won’t have a team. \n\nEdit: They are in-network with my PPO and accept other insurance. No Medicaid, I don’t know about Medicare \n\n“Examples of indirect care include meetings where members of the child’s treatment team discussed the child’s progress in their treatment plan, as well as the creation of progress reports. If the child’s treatment program is funded by a program that allows us to bill for indirect care, then the client is not responsible for the cost-share associated with indirect care. However, if they do not cover indirect care ** Therapy will bill you directly.\nThe explanation of benefits (EOB) that you receive from your insurance provider may shows that they had paid for dates of service where the client did not have any direct interaction with the treatment team. If a client’s insurance benefit is canceled and the client does not inform ** Therapy of the benefit cancellation, then the client or legal guardian will be responsible for payment of the direct and indirect care that is not covered by the insurance provider. Therefore, it is very important that you inform ** Therapy immediately if the client’s benefit is canceled. If ** Therapy services are self-funded, then the child or legal guardian is responsible for payment of all direct and indirect care.”\n\nCOMMENT 1: While not quite the same thing, my daughter’s endocrinologist charges $200/year to cover dealing with the prior authorizations and letters of medical necessity.

Just document in Google Drive after signing the BAA and submit an electronic claim on availity.

Apparently my patient's insurance has been reimbursing for \"home health.\" I'm not sure if this is because I used Point of Service code 12 for \"home.\" Is there a different type of coding I should use to indicate to the insurance company that this is outpatient therapy that happens to be taking place in the home (or should I just omit the POS code all together)? I really value this client and want to help him get the proper reimbursement from his insurance co. TIA for any help, guidance, or direction you can provide!\n\nCOMMENT 1: POS 11 = Office. Some carriers only see 12 as HH. They advise to use 11 as mobile many times. You just need to ask not using \"mobile\" or \"home\". POS 12 PT.

I feel like right out of the gate that demonstrates the simplicity and transparency of the business model, which is one of the biggest upsides. It also can remind them that that is how most other business operate, and reinforces that that is entirely reasonable. Then I gauge it from there based on their response.  Sometimes I bring up super bills and HSA/FSA, sometimes I basically say “I am out of network for multiple reasons” which opens a door for them to ask why, and I can explain the benefits of the business model a bit. Sometimes I say “out of network care can be more or less cost effective depending on your coverage and issue” and I’ll follow with asking if they have stellar or poor coverage/copays if they’re post op or non op etc. which gives them a chance to tell me what’s going on and build rapport. I truly don’t try and sell every call, I openly tell folks when i think in network is the move if I feel they’ll benefit from frequent shorter visits and have great coverage, and when low cost is a massive priority for them.\n\nGenerally when I drop that first line and leave it, they’ll have some questions that will demonstrate sticking points if they have any. Ultimately most are just asking that because they think that’s how you’re supposed to shop for healthcare, not because they’re sold on going in network. Usually they’re calling because they want to tell someone their problem, so I try and get us to that point without shoehorning the convo in any particular direction. \n\nBut, I also am not one that likes to haggle or do a lot of convincing. I don’t want a patient on my books that I have to fight to get scheduled because they don’t want to prioritize paying for care or can’t pay for care.

I feel like right out of the gate that demonstrates the simplicity and transparency of the business model, which is one of the biggest upsides. It also can remind them that that is how most other business operate, and reinforces that that is entirely reasonable. Then I gauge it from there based on their response.  Sometimes I bring up super bills and HSA/FSA, sometimes I basically say “I am out of network for multiple reasons” which opens a door for them to ask why, and I can explain the benefits of the business model a bit. Sometimes I say “out of network care can be more or less cost effective depending on your coverage and issue” and I’ll follow with asking if they have stellar or poor coverage/copays if they’re post op or non op etc. which gives them a chance to tell me what’s going on and build rapport. I truly don’t try and sell every call, I openly tell folks when i think in network is the move if I feel they’ll benefit from frequent shorter visits and have great coverage, and when low cost is a massive priority for them.\n\nGenerally when I drop that first line and leave it, they’ll have some questions that will demonstrate sticking points if they have any. Ultimately most are just asking that because they think that’s how you’re supposed to shop for healthcare, not because they’re sold on going in network. Usually they’re calling because they want to tell someone their problem, so I try and get us to that point without shoehorning the convo in any particular direction. \n\nBut, I also am not one that likes to haggle or do a lot of convincing. I don’t want a patient on my books that I have to fight to get scheduled because they don’t want to prioritize paying for care or can’t pay for care. If they truly can only afford me once every three weeks, have a ten dollar copay with deductibles met, they honestly may be better served in network anyhow, so I take the L, offer to help them find someone else, and don’t sweat it. \n\nThat’s my approach. May not be the best from a brute sales perspective, but it fits my personality well and is authentic to me, so it works!\n\nCOMMENT 2: “It’s great to talk to you! I’m not in network with any insurance companies, but I’m happy to provide a super bill, which is basically just an invoice for each visit that you can submit to your insurance for potential partial reimbursement.”"}

G/L\n\nCOMMENT 2: Just had the exact same thing happen and went through my audit Monday. It was stressful but I was prepared and the auditor was cool it took 30 minutes. Like the auditor said, it's an open book test, you can use your p&p manual to find the answers, you can Google, look up the Medicaid policies online. Whatever you need to do.

I clarified that this was technically OUTPATIENT PT, and she still said because it’s in the home it’s covered and she’ll just have to submit an invoice.

Customer Service is phenomenal. They are listening and updating all the time, small updates based on client feedback. Many things. Con: I don't think it's best for cash based."}

I made a brief video on this but frankly understand the basics and then work with a DME company as they have to have it all figured out if they are wanting to get paid and keep up with how it gets covered. If it is not covered then you provide your clients with options."}
