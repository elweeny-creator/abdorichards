Hoping to find an affordable marketer who can manage and run the campaigns. I know there are a lot of them out there, and many are not good. What have been your experiences? If your super happy with yours, can you drop their contact info?\n\nThank you kindly!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Who are you trying to reach with Google/Meta ads? A local audience or a broader range of potential clients? \n\nMy recommendation for Meta ads is Kwadwo. (Pronounced Quay-jo). I met him at a business conference and I really like his down-to-earth nature. I believe he would tell you if ads were going to be a waste of money or if it was the right move for your business. \n\nHere's his IG: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/quayjo/\nHe also had a podcast where you can get to know him more. Be sure to listen to the story of how he and his family were living in China but then got stuck in Mexico when Covid broke out - the wildest story ever!) \n\nI'm an OT and now run a marketing agency (focused on email marketing and sales funnels, plus a little LinkedIn ghostwriting). I've heard from way too many clinicians that the generic marketing agencies never really \"got them\", and the results were disappointing. It's a recurring theme in my discovery calls and it makes me so mad.\n\nMost of the bigger agencies have someone who does the sales calls, and that person may understand... but then they subcontract it out to a cheap writer/designer who is just trying to get it done as fast as possible. They use ChatGPT to \"understand\" your specialty, but miss the mark with the messaging. \n\nI've also been targeted by a lot of PT clinic ads that are totally irrelevant to me since I don't live anywhere near them.

I calmly educated him and he continued to literally scream at me. Patient was fine but didn’t say anything. I told him I understand his concern for his wife and safety but we are doing nothing outside of protocol, and I can call Doctor if wanted.  What would you do in this situation. I’m concerned it may happen again, and who knows if he blames any discomfort on my treatments and sues. Would you think it’s ok to discharge patient and recommend other OP facilities in town?\n\nCOMMENT 1: Very disrespectful. You could send her to another clinician or have family members sit out in the waiting area to provide some space to work with the client. The only time I allow family members to be in the session is if I’m doing family training.\n\nCOMMENT 2: Respect is a must. We can talk, argue, etc. but scream at me and you are discharged"}

This would be my first foray into such a practice model so I’m really relying on others’ experience with this.\n\nThere is a new gym opening in my area. They are offering 10x12 clinic rooms as contracted space. They will provide a scheduling and payment platform/EMR, supplies (including table, needles, IASTM tools, cups, etc). Referrals would likely be easy, because it’ll be gym members and their personal training clients. I would still operate under my own LLC and liability insurance. Their offer is a 50/50 split on whatever income my appointments make. Given the conditions above, does this seem like good terms? If not, what would you say is “standard” in the industry with this type of set up?

This would be my first foray into such a practice model so I’m really relying on others’ experience with this.\n\nThere is a new gym opening in my area. They are offering 10x12 clinic rooms as contracted space. They will provide a scheduling and payment platform/EMR, supplies (including table, needles, IASTM tools, cups, etc). Referrals would likely be easy, because it’ll be gym members and their personal training clients. I would still operate under my own LLC and liability insurance. Their offer is a 50/50 split on whatever income my appointments make. Given the conditions above, does this seem like good terms? If not, what would you say is “standard” in the industry with this type of set up? When we met, I suggested 30 minute appointments at a flat rate of $75 per client, which would include any manual therapy, needling, etc, with the impression these would be the services most clients in the gym would be looking for.

Just want the door to be open both ways, so all ideas are welcome! Thanks 🙂"}

This group is an absolute blessing.… \n\nBackground info first:\nI’m a DPT, CSCS with an LLC. \nMain gig is independent contractor at an ortho clinic and then I see private clients/athletes under my LLC with home visits. \n\nI also work for a gym 0-10 hours/week. Clients see me for personal training, recovery sessions, and physical therapy. The gym pays me as their highest level trainer. I do not operate out of the gym as my business, they pay me W2. Clients pay the gym, gym pays me as employee. So this is where all my questions come from with this setup. \n\nMost important question:\n- I offer my home visit LLC clients a superbill obviously since that is my business but a gym client is asking, I said no since she pays the gym and not me (my personal info & medical credentials is not on her bills, she pays for a level X trainer). Is this the right assumption? Is there a better explanation to give her? I said, “I don’t think so but I’ll do some research.” They then asked/suggested if I could write a letter with my info, medical reasons they are being seen and attach a gym bill… I’m not sure how to proceed     🙏 any advice?🙏 \n\nTwo other questions if anyone has read this far: \n- Trainers want me to assess their Medicare age clients for minor injuries, HEP, and program advice/modifications. The goals are for in the gym & wellness is not covered by Medicare. Even so do I need to have them sign something strictly because they are consulting with a PT and no cash PT with Medicare eligible? Or should i just be extra clear in my personal documenting?\n\nConsent form:\n- I assume I’m covered by the gym since I’m hired as a trainer but they don’t have anything to help regarding my license (I’m assuming). Because of this should I have those seeing me because I’m a PT sign a consent from my LLC? I have liability insurance under my LLC with the gyms name in the policy. Would a form even be valid in case something happened since the client never paid the LLC but only the gym?\n\nIn order to be a business you must act like a business but this pay setup makes that quite confusing 🫠. This is my fun job that I’m using to learn from, it’s not permanent but I’d rather not give it up because having a PT license is over complicating it lol", "comments": [{"text": "I would not provide the gym client a superbill. You are seeing her as a trainer, not a PT. Though you are held to your highest license, if you start providing superbills at the gym you are essentially saying you are performing PT services which is not the intended job there and could get very muddy. If she wants to see you for reimbursable services she would have to see you through your LLC, in my opinion. Please note that all of this is just how I would operate things and is not intended as legal advice.

This group is an absolute blessing.… \n\nBackground info first:\nI’m a DPT, CSCS with an LLC. \nMain gig is independent contractor at an ortho clinic and then I see private clients/athletes under my LLC with home visits. \n\nI also work for a gym 0-10 hours/week. Clients see me for personal training, recovery sessions, and physical therapy. The gym pays me as their highest level trainer. I do not operate out of the gym as my business, they pay me W2. Clients pay the gym, gym pays me as employee. So this is where all my questions come from with this setup. \n\nMost important question:\n- I offer my home visit LLC clients a superbill obviously since that is my business but a gym client is asking, I said no since she pays the gym and not me (my personal info & medical credentials is not on her bills, she pays for a level X trainer). Is this the right assumption? Is there a better explanation to give her? I said, “I don’t think so but I’ll do some research.” They then asked/suggested if I could write a letter with my info, medical reasons they are being seen and attach a gym bill… I’m not sure how to proceed     🙏 any advice?🙏 \n\nTwo other questions if anyone has read this far: \n- Trainers want me to assess their Medicare age clients for minor injuries, HEP, and program advice/modifications. The goals are for in the gym & wellness is not covered by Medicare. Even so do I need to have them sign something strictly because they are consulting with a PT and no cash PT with Medicare eligible? Or should i just be extra clear in my personal documenting?\n\nConsent form:\n- I assume I’m covered by the gym since I’m hired as a trainer but they don’t have anything to help regarding my license (I’m assuming). Because of this should I have those seeing me because I’m a PT sign a consent from my LLC? I have liability insurance under my LLC with the gyms name in the policy. Would a form even be valid in case something happened since the client never paid the LLC but only the gym?\n\nIn order to be a business you must act like a business but this pay setup makes that quite confusing 🫠. This is my fun job that I’m using to learn from, it’s not permanent but I’d rather not give it up because having a PT license is over complicating it lol\n\nCOMMENT 1: I would not provide the gym client a superbill. You are seeing her as a trainer, not a PT. Though you are held to your highest license, if you start providing superbills at the gym you are essentially saying you are performing PT services which is not the intended job there and could get very muddy. If she wants to see you for reimbursable services she would have to see you through your LLC, in my opinion. Please note that all of this is just how I would operate things and is not intended as legal advice. Hope that helps.\n\nCOMMENT 2: If a gym client wants Physical Therapy give her option of home based or office based treatments not at the gym. Jumping back and forth as a trainer the a PT doing injury assessments and education is creating confusion for you so imagine how confused clients and patients will be. As far as liability in the event something happens and a law suit is filed typically Everyone gets pulled into the suit. Who ever pays the premium is the sole responsibility of that insurance company. Always protect yourself with your own policies even if employers has a policy with your name on it also."}

Though I want to establish myself in this niche community, as I'm starting out I want to prioritize reaching more people so that I can scale. That is to say, I don't want my website to only highlight the niche audience if that will reduce the likelihood of getting other types of athletes, but I also recognize that including too many areas of specialty can dilute the sense of expertise in the area I want to establish myself in.\nAny advice on what kind of balance to strike here?\n\nCOMMENT 1: I think highlight everything you’re comfortable with on your website, with separate pages on the site for your niche things. Also, my oldest son is named Kelton! I’ve never seen someone else with his name!"}

I was hoping you could give me some guidance here. \nSo my current business plan is mobile PT for Medicare and cash with a niche in Geriatrics and eventually with fitness athletes. My cash rate would be $175/visit. \n\nHowever, I have a friend engaged to a dentist, and the dentist knows a concierge doctor, an internist, in a very affluent area about an hour away from me. \nIt sounds like that concierge doctor would be interested in having a mobile PT for some of his patients. \n\nSo, if this opportunity becomes a reality, I would be driving an hour to see some pretty wealthy people. I'm told that this doctor charges $150k a year just to be your doctor, labs and tests cost extra. \n\nI have not talked to the doctor yet about this, but I met him briefly several months ago at a birthday party. The dentist texted him last night to see if he would be interested and the doc responded \"sure.\"\n\nHow would you approach this? What questions would you have?  Would you charge a higher rate (obviously would need to just for the commute)?  Would you offer a true \"concierge\" service where they pay monthly or yearly for say 1 or 2 visits a week, or just take referrals as they come for a specific plan of care? \n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated. \nThanks!", "comments": [{"text": "I would hire a therapist in that area as I don't want to drive 2 hrs round trip", "date": "2023-06-26 01:05:10", "author_id": "554066653", "comment_url": "https://www.facebook.com/groups/uncagedcliniciangroup/posts/1268909197213643/?comment_id=1268989170538979"}, {"text": "I would not want to go Concierge for a fee and be obligated to them for service.

I was hoping you could give me some guidance here. \nSo my current business plan is mobile PT for Medicare and cash with a niche in Geriatrics and eventually with fitness athletes. My cash rate would be $175/visit. \n\nHowever, I have a friend engaged to a dentist, and the dentist knows a concierge doctor, an internist, in a very affluent area about an hour away from me. \nIt sounds like that concierge doctor would be interested in having a mobile PT for some of his patients. \n\nSo, if this opportunity becomes a reality, I would be driving an hour to see some pretty wealthy people. I'm told that this doctor charges $150k a year just to be your doctor, labs and tests cost extra. \n\nI have not talked to the doctor yet about this, but I met him briefly several months ago at a birthday party. The dentist texted him last night to see if he would be interested and the doc responded \"sure.\"\n\nHow would you approach this? What questions would you have?  Would you charge a higher rate (obviously would need to just for the commute)?  Would you offer a true \"concierge\" service where they pay monthly or yearly for say 1 or 2 visits a week, or just take referrals as they come for a specific plan of care? \n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated. \nThanks!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I would hire a therapist in that area as I don't want to drive 2 hrs round trip\n\nCOMMENT 2: I would not want to go Concierge for a fee and be obligated to them for service. Life happens and if for some reason you can't continue treatment then what? Also do you have special skills for TMJ or anything of that nature that the dentist would find advantageous to his practice? Have you studied and trained in cranial sacral therapy?"}

Medicare doesn't cover therapy provided in community settings like a library or gym but if you have a lease with the gym and it's your office you'd use 11. If you see clients in their home at an ALF it's still 12."}

I have a hybrid business model offering PT and OT with specialty for wound care and lymphedema. We take cash, Medicare, and BCBS. Located in Chicago.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Think outside your typical referral sources. Go straight to the consumers. Offer free workshops with support groups, libraries, gyms, etc. Teach basic anatomy and give them a taste of why they would want to work with you. Just ask for name and email to start your own distribution list.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I tried marketing to the same for awhile my 1st year in practice and got no where. But keep at it. Within the last 6 months I've had 2 doctors start referring to me regularly. It helped that the patients I saw from them gave me raving reviews during their followups, so they started sending more to me. My business coach also says it takes 12+ 'touches' to make someone interested and purchase from you, so just have to keep consistent with it. Most of my referrals come from word of mouth, previous patients, friends and family. Just starting to get some more from Google and my website."}

Looking to treat overhead athletes- CrossFit, softball, baseball, etc. \nI was just a 5/6am athlete, but have been trying to go to other class times so different athletes can learn who I am. \nOnce softball/baseball tournaments start back up I’d like to set up a table there. \nAny advice for ways to get new patients?\n\nCOMMENT 1: I used to do free consults in my gym once per month.  15 min and occasionally invited a doc to join me. In NYC that’s golden. He got a few new patients that needed a formal office  visit. For the basic strains and tendinitis issues he gave them a script to see me.

If it's ok with HIPPA (I would think it is) it helps to include the name because there are certain patients that stick out to you and having that reassurance in a quick read is gold.\n\nCOMMENT 2: If possible, I’ll personally drop off the eval and offer an in-person thank you to any new MD referral sources, which removes any HIPPA issues. \nAlso, I set up a weekly call in time w several of my main referral MDs, so I can give him/her a quick live update about their Pt’s. They appreciate getting live feedback, so they can ask questions etc. This is especially true for those MDs who offer concierge cash based services; as they want to really be on top of their pts and want their pts to know their getting full personal service and care. This way, they tell the pt “I spoke to your PT, he said you’re doing better etc”. Also, it helps me recapture lost/lazy pts, as the MD will call them to remind them to restart PT"}

I made the changes in wix, then other changes in google. I think this is what suspended my acoount.

At first, Josh Payne, David Bayliff and myself wanted to \"stay in our lane\" and focus on coaching and mentorship but this changes NOW. \n\nThis group has evolved and grown through the last several years and although the growth is exciting, it's also very sad that the level of satisfaction and fulfillment in healthcare seems to be plummeting. \n\nWe all have our thoughts on why this is the case but we're all fighting in isolation and lack a common voice and space for grassroots change and growth. \n\nWill we \"fix\" healthcare in the US? probably not, but the goal that we have is to unify the voices of PTs, OTs, SLPs, and more and stop the infighting that keeps us from collective growth. \n\nIn order to bring us more together, we're launching a community platform and app that focuses on clinical and business development, resourcing clinicians, mentorship, collaboration, accountability, and community and we want YOU to be a part of it. \n\nYes this will take time and yes there will be some kinks that need to be ironed out but we need a group of clinicians who are willing to be trailblazers with us to help move this mission forward. \n\nAll that being said, we are hosting an EXCLUSIVE training and launch party on March 22nd at 8:00 pm eastern to teach you, motivate you, and show you what we've been working on. \n\nSpaces in the training are limited and spaces for the trailblazers on the app are going to be limited as we continue to grow and launch this to more and more people! \n\nRegister using the link below and give this post some love because we want to make sure everyone in this group knows that we're on a mission to unify voices in our fields and reinvigorate the passion that you once had for loving, serving, caring, and leading others in healthcare.\n\nCOMMENT 1: So pumped!! This is going to change the game for our profession and healthcare as a whole\n\nCOMMENT 2: Let’s GO Uncaged Clinicians!!

This year will be different.  \n\nI refuse to allow myself to be held back and kill my dreams… I am working through my limiting beliefs and making changes to fix myself.  Saying no to things is the first thing I am changing. Let this year be YOUR year to make amazing changes so that all your dreams can come true and you can change your life.\n\nCOMMENT 1: PAL-You-bin!!!\nI have no doubt you have got this!!!\n\nYou have come so far, I’ve seen it!\nThis is just a valley you’re in right now… look everywhere for the light, the light that gets you going …truly gets you going… not the easy superficial stuff… the stuff you know deep down inside is hard, but simultaneously lights your fire …. \nI’m here rooting for you and if you need an 👂 \n😘❤️😘❤️\nRemember: the fear is feeding you false information, telling you all sorts of bullshit about yourself… stop listening… it’s not helping you at all!!!   \n“And ….we’re walkin’…” Denver Live event 🤣😘\n\nCOMMENT 2: Big goals require big help and big faith. Keep reaching out, keep plugging in to community, and keep God at the front of it all.\n\nGod is not surprised by anything you do, or anything the world throws at you."}

The other 'guides' on our trip are incredibly positive as they rally with each other so we all get down safely.\n\nThere is an amazing community experience down in the Grand Canyon! There are also amazing communities here in Uncaged, with the Private Practice Section and with the other associations we have out there.  \n\nThanks to everyone for looking out for each other! What a cool thing to be a part of!"}
