Hey all - I want to introduce to you Bryan M. Laughery. He is a friend and business partner of mine who has a unique opportunity for us all that could make us some extra cash on the side.

He is working with a company that serves veterans with their DBQ assessments for disability. Essentially they need a network of PTs who to do these assessments that take 15-20 mins and they will pay you for it. You then can use these referrals to possibly convert to paying clients. 

Who wants to be paid to receive referrals of people who are in pain that need YOUR help? Comment below and he will get in touch with you.

Many of you already know me well enough to know this is a great opportunity and I can vouch for Bryan's ethics and I guarantee you won't be disappointed in having a conversation with him. This is a win (you) win (Bryan) win (vets) for everyone...

**Original Post:**
I've seen a lot of concern about us losing the title "professional". The absolute lowest bar of acting like a professional is being a member of your professional organization. 

APTA is all over this fight and other fights like it every day, year after year. They protect and maintain our profession from constant attacks on our scope and our payment. I hope you'll join the 100,000 members of APTA who choose to support these constant battles that threaten our profession.
 

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm going to step away from this and let it bubble a little bit, but I'll be back with more responses. I would love to hear more from others who have had positive experiences in APTA. I see your thumbs up, but we need more vocal advocacy like this for our essential organization. Most people don't understand what a professional organization does, and I'm happy to try to pull back the curtain. A lot fo the work sounds boring, but it is literally the difference between PT existing and being swallowed up bit-by-bit by "body workers" and others. We would cease to exist shockingly fast without APTA.

> **Response 2:** All the pitchforks and torches came out to represent here, and I can't possibly find the time to respond to all of them. If you see that a bunch of people were clamoring for continued representaion as "professionals", and others could care less and have other priorities.... and then you multiply that by hundreds of issues with differing opinions across 300,000 licensed PTs, you start to see the complexity of APTA. I hope more of the PT profession can start to see APTA not as an optional organization, but one that fills hundreds of essential roles that no other organization can fill. Once we, as a profession, recognize that fact, we can all work together to make our profession and it's impact on people even better.

How many of you are brand new business owners? 👇

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I feel every day is a new day where I discover one thing that I need to focus on and master before adding anything else to my plate. It gives me a renewed sense of direction or passion project that not only provides value to me as a business owner but what can I do to serve my community better.

**Original Post:**
PTs- thoughts on becoming an APTA member? I've heard mixed thoughts and wondering if it worth it. If so, what other dues (chapters) did feel was worth paying for in addition to membership and your state chapter?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love being a member. I'm headed to Boston on Wednesday for Combined Section Meeting, a gathering of over 15,000 PTs/PTAs students. The educational content, resources, CEUs is top notch and being a member and getting involved in the Academy of APTA Home Health has introduced me to tons of clinicians across the country, given me opportunities to represent home/mobile based clinicians on CPG projects, present content on part B at home to the Neuro section. I could go on and on. It is a seriously small percentage of our profession that belong to the APTA compared to other health care professions. I encourage everyone to get involved and be the difference you want to see.

> **Response 2:** No way. My job paid all membership dues so I became a member and part of several sections and stayed a member for 6 years and got nothing out of it more than a magazine and the occasional sticker. Not worth it.

Seeking advice on what to wear as a female, mobile PT.

I am a mobile PT.  I wear a logo'd t-shirt, jogger (poly/spandex blend / not sweat) pants, and clean/nice tennis shoes when I see clients and when I go to networking events.  I feel like it is my "uniform."  My husband thinks I look unprofessional.  He thinks I should wear a polo shirt (or a button up shirt) --especially for networking events and definitely if I meet a doctor.  I hate polo shirts.  I don't want to wear polo shirts and khakis.  I think they look/feel corporate.  I do not feel like that is me.  I, personally, feel stuffy in them.  I don't want to be stuffy.  I want to feel like me.  He thinks a stranger deciding between a PT wearing a polo shirt ("professional") or me wearing my logo'd t-shirt and jogger pants ("sloppy"), the stranger would go with the polo shirt PT because of 1st impressions. I said that is a stupid reason to choose a PT, but he says people think like that.  

I don't have much of a caseload right now, which I don't think is because of my clothes.  I think it's because it is hard to build a mobile practice when you don't have a head start of referral sources or prior patients to seek you out.  He thinks I need to wear a polo so people take me more seriously.  We, seriously, have had multiple arguments about this.  (Btw, he works in the civil engineering world where sometimes he meets public figures - I told him our work worlds are different, but he still disagrees.)   

What do you think?  Do I need to suck it up and get some freaking polo shirts?  I am especially interested in hearing what other female, mobile PTs wear to patient (older adults) homes and to networking events/meetings with doctors.  Thanks, in advance, for being a neutral 3rd party, lol.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If I’m going to someone’s home odds are I’m doing heavy transfers or dealing with catheter bags, etc so I wear scrubs. If I’m seeing patients in my space it leggings with pockets ( athleta makes thick nice ones that give great compression) with a professional top and flats. I definitely have gone to talk to doctors in this outfit too.

> **Response 2:** Know your audience.....

anyone have any luck getting Google to take down reviews that you've flagged or reported? 🥲She brought down my five star average🤬

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just backing up what most have already said. Her “review” says more about who she is, and is no reflection on you. She makes herself look foolish by posting it. Leave it up.

> **Response 2:** Hmmm. I wouldn’t take that down. 1.) all 5 star 46 reviews seems fake. 2.) that message suggests you are a more premium, high end service provider. 

I think she did you a favor.

With client permission: see brief history in my comments, but here’s the video. Patient is a 50 year old, active (spins, skis)married female.  Put on mute to ignore my voice so I don’t sway you to think what I’m seeing

**Community Responses:**

First bad review. Coming only from a phone call. Is this something that can be removed by google since we never really saw/ provided our service to the patient? Or just leave it there since we have 100+ 5 stars and maybe 1 bad review wont hurt? 🙂 I appreciate and comments!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Also my response is from chatgpt 😁😁 i asked chatgpt to respond to this review in a way that it will benefit my google business page lol

> **Response 2:** People are literally the worst and don’t realize that their commercial insurance sucks which is why healthcare CEOs are being shot on the street, but they’ll figure that out when they go to A Pt mill ￼

I’m struggling to get patients. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve advertised, marketed, sponsored events, bought  dinners for doctors, spoke with every gym in the county, talked to chiropractors, massage therapists etc. I have no idea what to do anymore

**Original Post:**
This post is for those who are nervous about networking with local businesses. I met with six different businesses over the last two weeks - two small gyms, a running shoe store, a massage therapist, and two Pilates studios. Of those six businesses and WITHOUT ME ASKING: 

- three offered to host a pop-up for me 
- one offered to host a workshop “because I have so many clients I know will benefit from this”
- the shoe store wants me at local runs they organize as medical coverage “and so you can get free advertising”
- one offered to rent me a room should I want a home base 
- two offered to feature my business as part of their monthly newsletters with their email lists
- one Pilates studio walked me down the street to introduce me to a local acupuncturist “because they need to know about your business” 

Will all of these pan out perfectly? No. But people are far more encouraging than I anticipated. All I did was:

1. Tell these businesses that I want to know where to send my clients (so their biz will benefit from meeting with me)
2. Speak about how I want to fill a need in my community that other PT clinics don’t
3. I was honest in telling these businesses that I just started advertising my services and hope to make it a full time venture. 

I’ve reached out to about 20 businesses so far and I anticipate many won’t return my messages or be interested in meeting - and that’s okay! 

So many of you have been encouraging and I really appreciate this community ❤️ I hope this can be a boost for others like me who dislike networking or have been intimidated by reaching out to local businesses.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s awesome! What did that look like from the start?
-did you contact them ahead of time to schedule a meeting, or just drop in on them?
-who did you ask to speak with or meet with?
-what did you lead with as your first introduction? And how did you talk about your business?
-were these businesses that your friends/family already go to or own, or were these “cold” meetings?
-at what point did you offer to help them, and how did you word it?

> **Response 2:** For those asking, here is a cold email I sent to one of the gyms and feel free to steal:    Hi Gabe,

I’m happy to see a gym in Gig Harbor that focuses on well-rounded strength training for clients. I have a new business in Gig Harbor as a mobile physical therapist and am looking for the best places to send my patients to build strength and fitness during or after injury, or for my patients who are focusing on performance.

From your website, I get the sense that your business is geared towards a wide variety of people! Are there certain types of clients who benefit most from your services? Particular areas of interest for your trainers?

If possible, I’d love to come in and say hi or at least talk over the phone. This would allow me to better understand what you offer clients.
I hope to meet you soon, and thanks!

I am a cash based, mobile uncaged PT, and will be sitting down for a podcast episode with the president of the APTA. If you have any questions or topics of conversation that you think might be relevant or interesting to discuss, please let me know as I am starting to plan the episode. 

Keep in mind this podcast is not strictly structured, and more conversation based...

Thank you to this group!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What is being done to advance direct access in all states. If we're supposed to be primary care providers for msk issues we need full direct access. 

Definitely the choice for Medicare patients to choose who they see.

If these things arent being done, why be a member? I stopped renewing because it wasn't worth it.

> **Response 2:** Hey Noe hope you and Natalie are doing well 

1. Opting out of Medicare. But that’s been said once or twice. 

2. Ordering labs/bloodwork/ imaging/ across the board not just state by state. 

3. Increasing reimbursement but that will give you the normal political answer of not In my control… 

4. What efforts are being made if any to create an Evaluation/management codes for us to use for maintaining health and longevity  ie cancer, ESRD, neuro conditions,  / or what efforts are being made for evaluating a patient referring to the appropriate provider of a different specialty?  Other providers get paid for this 

5. What efforts are being made for chart reviews of incoming complex patients? 

6. Does the US intent on ever moving towards the military model domestically and having DPTs prescribe, perform injections PRP etc like in so many other countries? 

7. What efforts are being done to stop insurance companies from “treating patients” using algorithms without a single licensed clinician reviewing the cases?  Think HR 238 which is set to allow technology to prescribe and treat diseases without a physician.

If only it always was that easy. Just had a patient come to my at-home office. We finished in about 45-50 min and they handed me $160 cash at the end. 

10 minutes later me and the wife are rearing up to play a board game. I could be ok with this kind of life.

**Community Responses:**

How did I miss this this week??? Who went? What was the outcome?? Why wasn’t this all over the place?? Not only did I not see it all over I didn’t see it all ALL ANYWHERE. Link below 👇🏼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I went.  Got multiple emails about it ahead of time....starting in Jan/Feb timeframe I believe.  About 1/4 of the PTs there were private practice owners.  You're split up by states and you schedule meetings ahead of time with your senators and local districts.  I also went 5 years ago.  It's impossible for a lot of PTs to go because you absolutely cannot put 20+ PTs in a meeting room with a congressman...they physically wouldn't all fit.  BUT that isn't to say that when your representatives are back home and away from DC that you meet up with them and advocate for what you want to see change.  That really is the best way and I've done that many times here.

> **Response 2:** Same! Saw the After photos.

Update. All cleaned. Got my EMR.  Got my faxing service. Marketing Photoshoot today!!!! 

Waiting on branding, logo, website, and social media marketing but it’s all starting today!! 

My goal was 10 visits a week. I know it’s only been ONE week of hitting my goal, but I had 10 visits this week and I’m so excited. 

How does everyone market to keep evals coming in? I’ve heard some people just do social media, some only send their evaluation notes back to the patients primary care provider to keep your name in the back of their minds…stopping in and giving business cards?? 

My dream is coming true 🥰🥰🥰

Side note- the pictures and video are taken with iPhones “zoom out” option. Total gym space is only 221 square feet 🤪🤪😭😭

This is the message I got from my patient today after going to her ortho follow up with her. I’ve heard Anthony Maritato talk about going to MD appts with patients several times. David Bayliff and I have been talking about how to network too! 

Since starting my mobile business I want to do things differently than I’ve done in the past and try to add as much value as I can. 

She is my first patient. She is seeing a local ortho doc that I have met a few times and grew up with a ton of people I grew up with. 

She had a distal humerus fracture and wore her sling 4 weeks longer than she should have. She couldn’t get PT here because she had out of state BCBS. A friend of a friend gave her my number. 

When I first saw her, she was in tears after her ortho postop visit. They told her to do PT 4x/wk, get dynasplint and she would need about 4 months of PT to even hope of getting her range back. She’s 35 c 3 kids and was scared to death. 

I gave her my rate and we decided on once a week if she would do exactly what she was supposed to do. 

After week 3 we decided on the dynasplint. Yesterday was week 6 of PT at once a week and week 3 of the dynasplint. She maxed out the extension component of the brace. 

We went into the visit missing about 5 degrees of ext and of flex. When she started she was stuck about 5-10 from 80 both ways. 

Also her bone wasn’t healing when she went last time. 

She is still not completely healed, but they released her back to work and scheduled her for 3 months out. 

I was nervous about going, because I didn’t want it to be about what I was doing there, but wanted to see if this actually made a difference in her outcome and her perceived value. I think her text and her Google review shows the value. 

Please make time to do this. I also got to talk to the ortho doc and PA. I had never met the PA. I got to share a funny story with them about texting someone who I thought was the doc (they will remember that because they all made fun of the doc afterwards in good fun). I spent about 5 minutes with the ortho MD who have me his cell number and asked how he could send more people to me. 

My plan is to focus more on the direct primary care and concierge docs in town, but I want to spend time with anyone I can to show the value I’m providing. 

This is purposely long to show how much personal value i got from this and how much my patient felt honored and cared for with this experience. 

Just do it!!!

So looking again with frustration at all the other practices that encroach no matter how inappropriate. Maybe not taught kinesiology, physiology for a reason. Where is APTA protecting us. Other than dry needling. I can do more with less restrictions as a trainer or massage therapist. Sorry but frustrated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My frustration is more about the restrictions placed on PT and not other disciplines providing the same service. If it's safe for them without restrictions then why not us. As a PT, I can not take cash from a Medicare recipient but as a massage therapist or trainer I can. Ridiculous. I applauded anyone who takes the time to expand their toolbox, and provide great care, but as a PT, I expand mine and then limited as to what I can do, how I bill, who I have to report to. Just frustrating.

> **Response 2:** This is going to be an unpopular opinion but anyone with a brain and a desire can learn to do any of this online these days and can be highly effective and impactful to their clients. I think this mostly makes us upset as PTs because we went through the system, spent a crap ton of time and money and now seemingly have to compete with non PTs for the same clients. Personally, besides the foundational knowledge which is actually part of all healthcare curriculum, everything I learned that’s applicable and used on a daily basis came after school. This ad attracts me- this person admits their education was lacking, has intimate knowledge of the feel of structures and went above and beyond to educate themselves properly regarding strengthening. Kudos to them.

I wanted to share a small victory. Prior to this week, I had 3 patients on my caseload being mobile for the last 3 months. But I kept going to MD offices to market every week in my down time. This week, I went from 3 patients to having 3 more evals faxed to me, which blows my mind. 

In addition, I partnered with a local OP clinic I’ve been going to personally for a year and they’ll be sending me patients that have transportation issues or want it at their home. 

Thank you all for motivating me and helping me along this process. It means more than I can put in words.

MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT. 

TLDR: register for the Uncaged Clinician Community and App launch party using the link in the comments! 

Honestly this is the biggest thing we've ever done at Uncaged Clinician and our team is so excited to start sharing it with you! 

We're in a unique position that we've been asked to leverage for the betterment of PTs, OTs, SLPs, Chiros, Mental Health Providers and more. At first, Josh Payne, David Bayliff and myself wanted to "stay in our lane" and focus on coaching and mentorship but this changes NOW. 

This group has evolved and grown through the last several years and although the growth is exciting, it's also very sad that the level of satisfaction and fulfillment in healthcare seems to be plummeting. 

We all have our thoughts on why this is the case but we're all fighting in isolation and lack a common voice and space for grassroots change and growth. 

Will we "fix" healthcare in the US? probably not, but the goal that we have is to unify the voices of PTs, OTs, SLPs, and more and stop the infighting that keeps us from collective growth. 

In order to bring us more together, we're launching a community platform and app that focuses on clinical and business development, resourcing clinicians, mentorship, collaboration, accountability, and community and we want YOU to be a part of it. 

Yes this will take time and yes there will be some kinks that need to be ironed out but we need a group of clinicians who are willing to be trailblazers with us to help move this mission forward. 

All that being said, we are hosting an EXCLUSIVE training and launch party on March 22nd at 8:00 pm eastern to teach you, motivate you, and show you what we've been working on. 

Spaces in the training are limited and spaces for the trailblazers on the app are going to be limited as we continue to grow and launch this to more and more people! 

Register using the link below and give this post some love because we want to make sure everyone in this group knows that we're on a mission to unify voices in our fields and reinvigorate the passion that you once had for loving, serving, caring, and leading others in healthcare.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So pumped!! This is going to change the game for our profession and healthcare as a whole

> **Response 2:** Let’s GO Uncaged Clinicians!! Want to bring our profession together in a really unique way that hasn’t been done yet? We believe this is the beginning of so much! Get signed up ⬆️

"$500k/year" 

That's what someone just told me they had sitting there unbilled or clients that are being turned away because they can't find qualified therapists.  

First- it's amazing what our clients are accomplishing in their practices that this is what's waiting in referrals and being turned away. 

But more importantly than that, it gave me an opportunity to talk about something I've been noticing a lot recently. 

Many people and potential clients of Uncaged only want to talk about how to grow a business and how to make $$$$ in a practice. They LOVE talking about the ENGINE of a business but very rarely talk about the BRAKES of a business. 

Are brakes sexy? no. It's way cooler to talk about how many horsepower a car has 

But one of the quickest way to derail your practice/business is to sacrifice the quality of care, delivery, and boundaries. 

Don't build a business that is all horsepower and no stopping power.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Amen! I’ve found my business really flourishes when I say no to the opportunities that don’t feel right but have $$$ potential and yes to the opportunities that resonate with how I want to practice as a clinician. Takes guts and faith to trust the process.

> **Response 2:** Turning business away is hard. Often we hold on to it too closely and when we tell people "no" we feel that we're letting them down. 

I still have to untangle from this in a non-clinical role... and I was REALLY wound up in it while working clinically. (Mostly because if I said no, they had to drive for hours to find another OT... which sucks.) 

But you're SO RIGHT that when we focus on our areas of strength and pass on the opportunities that are outside of our zone -- we do more good and impact more lives in the long run. 

I've been leaning into this more this year and every time I say "I need to pass this project to someone else" I cringe, but it allows me to stay in my zone and find the best fit clients. 🙂

Hi everyone! I started my mobile cash based pelvic floor PT practice about 2 months ago. After going to countless doctors, I'm realizing this is not the best way to market. However, I haven't been successful yet and was wondering what people did for marketing/battling the "if I have insurance why should I pay cash" ideology. 

I have posted on some moms groups in the area and made an Instagram account that I post in a couple times a week. 

Any insight would be super helpful! TIA!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dont brand or sell yourself as PT to customers bc they may associate that with insurance

Just call yourself the Vagina Wizard or something and watch the clients roll in

Im half kidding half serious about the name, but you might get my gist

> **Response 2:** I have the same business model as well. I helped organize a local "women's health providers/fitness instructors" lunch meet up where we had doulas, midwives, Pilates instructors, personal trainers. stroller fitness teachers, etc. we have a great referral network with eachother . I also have a working relationship with the local OBs and pediatricians. Also- other concierge medicine providers are great referral sources. I also have a small instagram account I started just as my virtual business card and friended only local moms and local business owners instead of trying to market to the masses on social media (I rarely post but it's just so people can get some visuals)

It just depends 

If you need some strategy and support and love an artist, I think it’s worth whatever it costs 

I don’t personally care that much about my logo and has that made on fiver 

I’ve worked with artists on graphics I really cared about and spent a few hundred dollars each graphic

Can we talk social media?  Have you found social media presence to be a big boost to your business, and if so, which platform has worked best for you?

I'm toying with the idea of really increasing my presence on Instagram. Honestly I love the platform so it would be more for fun, with minimal expectation, more as a hobby, and to learn.   But I know it's a time consuming venture so was curious if over time you had true benefits to your business doing this?  Or did you find it to be a total time suck?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is such a great conversation because I recently hired a virtual assistant/marketing firm to help me grow (and serve) my presence on social media. ￼At the end of the day it’s the last thing I gave energy to do. We see geriatrics, PD, vestibular a post op primarily. It’s been helpful for clients and their families two see us in action and get a little bit of community. ￼We’ve had no direct client growth but have “secured” clients as they reported “we saw your legit.” 😊

> **Response 2:** I think it would depend on your demographic. My patients are mostly older and I get most referrals from word of mouth and home care therapists. The only patients I received from social media were family members of friends who saw I had started a business. If you are treating younger people I would think it might be helpful. Personally I prefer making connections in real life especially being mobile and going into peoples homes.

Hello!

I'd love your input. I launched my practice five months ago, but I'm struggling to gain traction. I've partnered with a marketer who holds an extensive lead list in my local area, boasting 2,000-3,000 potential leads. He sends out emails for me 1-2 times a week, featuring a short video that I create. We meet weekly to brainstorm video ideas, and he's also working on getting me into gyms for workshops. His fee is $750/month and he covers all the operational costs. I'm planning to collaborate for three months to assess the return on investment. Do you believe his services justify the cost? As someone new to marketing, I'd greatly appreciate your feedback. 

Thank you so much for your input

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What type of cash practice.. what population?

> **Response 2:** Are you out in the community and networking? Have you met with your local direct care physicians? Reached out to nurse case managers, ones in private practice and within in hospital systems? Visited your local senior centers and give talks about your services, disease process, fall prevention ect.. whatever your target population go to where they are and be visible. I'm scheduled to talk to a local Parkinsons support group and a dementia caregivers group in January- emailed them myself, introducing myself and asking to speak on the topic. You have to put yourself out there!

I will continue to seek guidance from here and continue to provide help to my fellow PTs and my wonderful community that I serve. 

I waited over 3 years to get here due to lack of confidence. I am finally moving the needle. If you are on the fence, please do not waste time like I did. Seek guidance and motivation sooner! 

Here's my brand new baby:

Dear group, looking for a little advice here.  I've been in private practice PT for over 20 years in my area.  Our local hospital is purchasing many of the independent PCP offices and establishing satellite clinics all throughout our surrounding area.  I was speaking with one of their physician's regarding referrals.  He informed me if any of the provider's use an "outside" (PT) referral they will usually get a phone call from someone within the hospital system asking them why they chose to use an outside source.  In other words, the provider's are strongly 'encouraged' to refer in-house.  This has to be illegal!!  Any advice on how best to address this?  Thank you.   Please feel free to DM if needed.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have the patient ask for a physical copy of the referral. They have every legal right to that and in the end it doesn’t matter where the referral is written to for physical therapy just that it exist and the patient can produce it for the PT clinic. ￼

> **Response 2:** These hospitals are buying up all competition and getting reimbursed more for their services by insurance companies than outpatient clinics. Greed is taking over the healthcare space

My neighbor today told me “in print” I may need to write out our credentials as PT DPT and not written out as doctor of physical therapy anywhere to avoid being sued by people who could claim I’m a medical doctor lol. Any substance to this that anyone knows of?

This year has been very challenging for me… 

Overwhelm….
Underwhelm…
Frustration…
Boredom….
Overwork….
Underwork…
Underpay….

All these emotions/ situations wrapped up in a single day, week, month and starting the year.  Getting away from my roots and proven known business concepts has left me paralyzed.  Speaking with my accountability partner these last few days has left me with the realization that I fill my days with tasks that don’t serve me, my family, my finances or my business. (Yes in that order). I feel busy, but what I am doing is holding space for tasks that won’t move me forward and missing opportunities that could… self sabotage is real and this is my limiting belief… “being busy will get me to my goals”. I’ve been lying to myself for the past 30-40 years and have limited myself dramatically.  This year will be different.  

I refuse to allow myself to be held back and kill my dreams… I am working through my limiting beliefs and making changes to fix myself.  Saying no to things is the first thing I am changing. Let this year be YOUR year to make amazing changes so that all your dreams can come true and you can change your life.

This comment from a patient today made my heart smile:

Patient: I love that you are so open and willing to talk about sexuality and gender identity. It’s rare to find a Doctor that isn’t either dismissive of me being non-binary or they just choose to dodge the topic entirely. It’s just refreshing to have you as a provider. 

This is why I’m pushing so hard to show LGBTQ+ people that they have an ally in their local healthcare community. There is such a huge disparity on how they are treated. 

When my patients come see me they will feel heard and be treated with kindness, empathy, and respect of their own individual belief systems.

What are everyone's thoughts on being an APTA member? Worth the cost?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a member.  We have no better option for power on Capitol Hill!  If we lose that, our profession heads in a very bad direction (or continues to).  If we had even half-way decent membership % we could push for some real change and reimbursement.  If not, we can probably just keep watching reimbursements fall 🤷🏻‍♂️

> **Response 2:** We have 100,000 members but there are 500,000 PTs and PTAs in the US. Membership makes the APTA stronger. Without membership we lose our collective voice. We need advocacy for our profession. Become a member, attend local chapter meetings, or join the board of your local chapter. As a member and board member, I recognize many benefits: connections/networking, professional development opportunities, continuing ed, online resources, and reduced rates for conferences to name a few.

I’m curious what your thoughts would be if you learned of a chiropractor in your area basically performing physical therapy in their clinic. Today I learned of a relatively new chiropractic clinic near me who advertises their services as “chiropractic adjustments, dry needling, functional rehabilitation, Gaston/IASTM, FAKTR, and cupping.” She also advertises pregnancy and postpartum care including stretching and exercises. I’m not exactly sure what all chiropractors are trained in, but it seems like this practice is blurring the line between chiropractic and PT. The name of the clinic doesn’t even have chiropractic in it. I’m on the fence about reaching out to this chiropractor as a potential referral source (her to me and me to her). I’m also trying to have the mindset of “there’s enough to go around” and not see her as competition, but it’s hard not to.

Update: I called and spoke to the chiropractor yesterday. She hasn’t even opened her doors yet but does next week. I’m meeting with her next Friday morning. She sounds really nice and was excited to hear from me. 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A good chiro and a good PT should practice pretty similarly

> **Response 2:** Chiropractors can bill 97110 and 97112, so what they are advertising is perfectly fine.  They just can’t call it physical therapy. 
I market myself on social media performing grade V manipulations of the spine, but I call it manipulations and not adjustments or chiro care.  We are very similar professions, so there is a lot of crossover.

We are looking to add another GeriHab Brick and Mortar Location. 

We currently have a Jackson Brick and Mortar location, mobile visits all over Northwest TN and Nashville and Knoxville.

For those that have Multiple Site Clinics. 

Do you just have one website and one FB page or multiple FB pages for different locations? 

Do you have separate business checking accounts and separate billing etc?

We also run FB ads to promote and get clients. 

Aaahhh... The joy of growing pains. 😁😁😁

Thank you!

No issues. From SEO GMB is great at figuring out where people are and passing your website to them. 

Just don’t make your H1 and meta of website related to one location and you’re golden.

> **Response 2:** Congratulations brother.  I recommend 1 website with 2 FB as active as you are on Facebook.  There are going to be different faces and 2 different communities.  If you weren't so active on FB I would say one.

Hi 👋🏼 need some advice on how to tell a patient you can’t see them anymore. He’s a real energy sucker, and I need to protect my mental health. He’s been through a lot and I gave him a contact of a local counselor in our area to work things out with. I’m seeing him for a total knee replacement since the local PT clinic doesn’t take his insurance. I am out of network with his insurance though and had to get pre-authorization to see him. 

He had his operation July 21st. Probably needs a manipulation (active range is about 90° flexion incredibly painful and he’s lacking 12° extension). I came into the picture about eight weeks postop. 

Any advice is appreciated. I live in a small rural community so don’t want a bad name because of this

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always play the card of wanting them to get the best care, and emphasizing that you’ve exhausted what you think you can do. Recommend back to ortho or trying another PT who “may have other tools or skills available”

> **Response 2:** I would tell him that you think you’ve taken him as far as you can and refer him back to the Dr. something is not right and beyond your scope of service if he has not progressed past that, especially with the extension. Does the Dr have a good reputation? They are ultimately responsible for patient response if they did the surgery.

I can tell you that one of our missions with UNCAGED - especially through our coaching programs - is to change healthcare!

I despise marketing emails.  I hate getting them... they immediately get trashed.  But "everyone" says to build your email list and send out the emails routinely.  I read in a book recently that you should expect about a 1% conversion on emails if you're making an offer.  So, despite hating the very thing that I was advised to do, I created a flyer and sent out an email with an offer of 20% off multi-visit packages through the end of the year.

You guys.

I sent the email out FOUR days ago to about 180 people, and I've sold SEVEN packages since then - about half of those are routine clients who would've purchased packages anyway, but at least one person is someone who had been a client earlier in the year and the email kickstarted him to come back.

Moral of the story: send the email, make the offer!

**Community Responses:**

If you let your license lapse or cancel it, can you still call yourself a Doctor of PT because of your degree, and then get like a personal training license and technically practice under that with no stupid rules or restrictions?  Thinking out loud 😬...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have OFTEN wondered this….

> **Response 2:** My understanding is that you are always held to the highest standard of your education (always makes me think of a person with a black belt in martial arts getting jumped in a nonprofessional fight on the streets, then the courts considering her hands as deadly weapons when she harmed the attackers🤣) . So even if you are not a licensed PT and are a certified personal trainer, your actions can be held to PT standards. 

More thinking out loud…I am also an athletic trainer and have wondered several aspects of this conundrum over the years.  One factor is which of many “stupid rules & restrictions” is one trying to avoid. The other would be the state practice act..think my state does not allow the use of “physical therapy” or “physical therapist” if not licensed, so one would have to be careful on verbiage with advertising, etc…but saying “Doctor of,” “degree in Physical Therapy” would be fine as long as misrepresentation of licensure is not alluded to. Another factor is in the last several years, I have discovered that a lot of the “stupid rules & restrictions” are actual folklore/myths perpetuated in our profession and by graduate programs who have not updated their curriculums, as well as being confused with requirements by insurance carriers, including Medicare.

Hi guys,

How do you guys contact gyms, yoga studios, or any facilities that you want to build a relationship with? 

What type of marketing do you do? 

I am starting a cash based mobile PT practice but unsure how to get started on marketing. I am in the process of completing my website right now.

I would appreciate any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just started my cash based mobile PT business about month ago. I stopped by some local gyms/studios that had a similar mission. When speaking to the owner, I told them how I could benefit them by keeping their members healthy or help them recover quickly from an injury. Now they are putting my info cards in all of their new member bags. I'm also providing inservices to their trainers.

> **Response 2:** Give more than you take. That’s super important when starting relationships. I highly discourage going in to meetings/emails just touting what you do and how you can help their clients. I suggest trying their services out, taking some of their classes, collaborate on a workshop/event, build a relationship—this takes time.

Ok, I got a bad review from someone that has never been our patient. It’s a fake review, likely orchestrated by a disgruntled ex-employee (yes, the one who was stealing patients to start her own clinic with). It’s not a HIPPA violation to respond saying that she’s not our patient, is it? Seems like a dumb question, but I just don’t want to make a misstep with this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would say something like “I’m sorry you’re unhappy. As the owner, I wanted to look into it and don’t have a patient in our system by this name. Please reach out so we can discuss this” or something like that.

Hi everyone! Just looking for a shoulder to lean on at the moment. I’ve worked extremely hard to get where I’m at today. I’ve finally gotten the word out enough and a patient recommended I sit on a panel for a national organization to talk about my specialities treating pediatric spine conditions. I’m so pumped but my SO is being a buzzkill and says I’m wasting my time because I’m not getting paid for it but in my mind I’m on stage with leading experts with so many opportunities for networking and essentially presenting my cases that I feel would generate a large amount of patients/consultations. They are also doing free marketing in my mind saving me a ton of time! Anyone else struggle with family or partners who don’t understand the whole concept of free screenings, community service, talks, etc to generate patients? 😠

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In any business there are times you have to hustle and not get paid for it. I think that is what sets apart entrepreneurs from worker bees, entrepreneurs risk their time, money and energy for an opportunity. Non entrepreneurs will only work for $. If it doesn't hurt your relationship, you do you! Don't look for validation even from your SO.

> **Response 2:** This is a great opportunity and you are clearly excited about it! That's all you need to focus on. Not every minute of every thing you do in your profession has an immediate monetary return. Do your thing, be confident and enjoy the experience!

Haven't ever worked in ortho, but try to keep up my ortho knowledge best I can. My 80 year old dad who hikes everyday injured his back pulling out finished plants from the garden and now can't walk without a walker. Sent him to an ortho PT and was told If disc is ruptured he would need surgery. This is different from what I remember learning. 
So my question is: 1) Do you see pts who need surgery for a ruptured disc?
2) effective exercises when everything is painful?
SI joint correction brings mild relief that doesn't last. Unable to perform meaningful extension standing or prone due to pain. Flexion worse than extension. Feels best on back with legs raised or on side with a pillow under top leg. 
Went from a painful back to not walking in a week. I would have expected him to get better not worse over the week. 
Thanks for your responses.
Edited to add: Positioning, distraction, and NSAIDs minimally helpful,  but still helpful.  
Pain radiates down right leg to outside of ankle. Constant ache back of thigh,  top quarter.
Getting a Rx for imaging since he is a Medicare recipient and doctor referral required for imaging.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would definitely get imaging for compression fracture. With these patients, very gentle mfr around area, core stabilization (hip isos), gentle sh extension with bands and focusing on stabilization stabilization stabilization. No ROM until fracture cleared. Usually with that their pain goes down but need to clear fracture before doing ROM.

> **Response 2:** Thank you for all the responses.  Positioning, distraction and NSAIDs minimally helpful, but still helpful. Getting a Rx for imaging since he is a Medicare recipient and requires a physician rx. Truly appreciate the insights.

For those of you who don't know me, yet - I am Kalyca! I work closely with Josh Payne, David Bayliff, and Kevin DeGroot at Uncaged Clinician. 

Over the past two weeks I've had the incredible honor of sitting in on our bi-annual Board Meeting Calls. These are something we do twice a year with each one of our Mastermind Students. 
The goal of these calls is to check-in, vision-cast, and better understand how we can truly show-up and support each individual business owner. 

I recognized something REALLY awesome yesterday that I wanted to share with the whole group...

If you know Josh, David, and Kevin ... you probably already admire them for their modesty and humility. All three of them often say the phrase, "it's not about me"... in reference to how IT IS all about each of our coaching students and IT IS about how we can serve them and care for them to the best of our ability.

Since they would never say this about themselves... I'll open up my loud mouth and share what I've witnessed. Watching them show up over and over and over again for every single one of our students is nothing short of REMARKABLE. 

They are so uniquely talented in recognizing what each person needs, articulating it in a supportive way, and truly serving from their heart so that each person can leave the call with their cup filled in just the right way. The manner through which they intuit this is actually pretty mind blowing to witness...

Support can come in many forms ... sometimes a gentle push, a shoulder to literally cry on, or an accountability partner. These guys always seem to know exactly what each person needs. 
Witnessing this gift in each of them makes me feel energized by how much they are living into their purpose. 

If ever you find yourself wishing you had this level of support... you should certainly consider seeking mentorship from these three... in my completely unbiased opinion 🙃😏🤣!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Kalyca Jin Zarich…. darn you… 🙌🙏❤️

> **Response 2:** ^ the best people you will ever meet

Hello! I am going to be offering virtual wellness/training and need an app that, in addition to a library of exercises, has the capability of recording myself doing an exercise, along with the client recording themselves for me to check their form. I've looked into TrueCoach, AC Health, Physitrack, and Everfit. I'd love your feedback! Also, GO BUCKEYES!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve used TrueCoach to remote manage hundreds of clients. Simple and the user interface for the client is great.

> **Response 2:** TrueCoach from a user end worked great (thanks Joe Camoratto). QuickCoach may be worth looking at too.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is epic. 

I have no idea who this guy is, but this is what I see…

💪🏼 A very strong brand voice. 

💵 Customers who have cash.

👑 An ideal client who expects to be treated as  part of the elite crew. 

👨🏽‍🦱 Bro viiiiiiibes all the way (and clients who resonate with this.) 

🙅🏼‍♂️ A guy who isn’t going to put up with crappy clients or disrespect. 

I’d never do this, it’s not brand aligned for me, but I totally commend him for being able to do this. 

My brothers barber has the same type of vibes. And my brother thinks he’s the best ever. 😆🙄

> **Response 2:** Would be willing to bet that shop goes under within the next 12 months. I get it and sympathize with them. But that post is just bad business. Nobody likes negativity. Even those of us who would never dream of skipping out on appointments. I would never schedule with them to begin with if I saw a post like this. Just gross!

Hi everyone! 👋 I’m a mobile outpatient PT located in Texas. I started a group called Rehab Professionals of Texas (PT, OT, SLP) to help make it easier for PTs, OTs and SLPs in Texas to refer to and connect with other clinicians in the state. 

I don’t benefit financially from people joining - it just  makes it easier for me to refer patients to other clinicians in the state. I got tired of not having good recommendations for patients that were moving or asking me about referrals for friends and family. So if you’re in Texas please come join us (and invite your Texas rehab friends) and help me grow the network!

Do you have your logo on your attire and if so where did you get it printed from?

It seems like “coaching” is completely unregulated. Why should I continue to fight insurance companies on reimbursement for CPT codes and to network for referrals from MD’s who don’t really value what I do? I’m in one of the 3 states with no direct access for a PT. Why not just become a “coach” and “train” people with a rehab/therapy mindset? Essentially be strictly Wellness. Surely I can find a masseuse to work with to offer manual/soft tissue services.

I’m obviously not in a professional crisis AT ALL…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s a tricky! I’m an OT in same place. I’m doing educational consulting/coaching for families but very low key. I want to expand but am worried

> **Response 2:** If I remember correctly there were some PTs in Texas that tried this. They were punished because they were held to the "limitations of their highest license". Essentially they were PTs with personal trainer Certs "training" people. They were in violation of direct access laws because the grey area was deemed to lean towards therapy and not wellness. So be careful with all your notes and wording you use. I'm not the extent of the punishment, but it was mentioned on a Jarod Carter podcast.

Hi! I originally built my own website on godaddy and it needs an upgrade. My business is doing well and my consultant recommended I use a website marketer who specializes in OT/PT. This is great but it costs $4000. The idea is that it will get more google referrals with all the fancy stuff they can do for SEO, etc. 

Can anyone attest that it was worth paying that much for a website?

Thank you!! I am struggling with this decision and need some opinions!

**edit- I’m not looking to rebuild it myself on a different platform. I need to outsource and want to know how much I should be paying for this service.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Me too Amy! I built mine on GoDaddy and have been considering hiring someone to update it and change it to Wordpress. Have not bit the bullet yet!

> **Response 2:** Good SEO costs way more. A good website costs about that. Just like with PT, good stuff isn't cheap

Taping experts:

6’6” 16 yo with negative MRI
Negative X-ray

Swelling and pain BETWEEN the border of the fibular  head and knee joint line Anterior

Lidocaine into tib fib joint decreased pain and swelling 

Swells and pain only with weight bearing activities 

Only swells to a point and pain to a point…never worse after 10 min of weight bearing

Need to stabilize AP tib fib …and decrease pistoning of fibula which seems to be the big problem 

Also considering a compression pad as swelling and injection seemed to stabilize some.

Thoughts…???

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would take a look at what their tibial internal rotation feels like side to side. The fibular head needs to guide posteriorly relative to the i￼nternally rotated tibia or when shifting into mid stance. Would also look at their hip internal rotation as well.

> **Response 2:** did he see an adolescent endocrine or ortho? with that height I would be worried about his growth plates! everyone is looking at fibular mechanics here, lets look at big picture

Hey guys….just curious about those of you having someone doing your social media marketing.  Wondering when you typically saw an ROI.  I’m just having someone do IG/FB with some FB boosts and 3 emails a month to my email list.  IG followers have doubled, biz page fb interaction has gone up but no new clients.  Getting a little tired of spending so much money.  But maybe I just need to be more patient or switch tactics.  What have u guys found to work best?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Social media marketing is the hard way to get new patients.  Focus on you past patient list.  Next to 0 money and will get you way more new patients than cold lead marketing on social media

> **Response 2:** Lead gen is, as Ray said, most profitable through past patients. Do your have a digital app that connects you quickly with all of your discharged patients? Even sending a Thinking of You note can re engage them and /or get referrals to their friends and family.

I needed to hear this because I have had these thoughts recently. Hope this helps some of you in the trenches with me. 

We all have bad days, weeks or months…. It is the nature of the beast of being a solopreneur and biz owner. Hell it’s the nature of life. But when is it good to give up??

I heard this from Jake Thompson today on one of his old podcasts.  “Never give up on a bad day. It’s easy to want to quit on our dreams and desires when we have a bad day, because everything in our perspective makes it seem like we should. But if you have a good day and you still want to quit, then maybe strongly consider it.”  If you can have a good day and you still don’t feel like this is for you, don’t feel bad. Realize that you have the gumption to look at yourself in the face and know that this road isn’t for you. And that’s ok. But don’t give up just because you had a rough/bad day. They are going to happen…

Uncaged clinicians, don’t give up on your dream because of a rough patch. We all have them, reach out and talk to someone: a mentor, accountability partner, a friend. They can help you through. If after a good day, you still want to quit, then realize this may not be for you, then find a new dream.  And crush that!!  Pivoting is never a bad thing!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Always good to hear this. Definitely in the crossroads of decisions

> **Response 2:** Love it. Thank you for sharing.

Today I saw a patient for s/p lumbar fusion 9 days post op. I’ve seen dozens or patients with this. I did 15 min of walking with pt and doing 5 x STS with patient and her husband (retired doctor) walks in the room and SCREAMS I am not complying with precautions by doing 5 sit to stands in a row (Great form not breaking any precautions). I calmly educated him and he continued to literally scream at me. Patient was fine but didn’t say anything. I told him I understand his concern for his wife and safety but we are doing nothing outside of protocol, and I can call Doctor if wanted.  What would you do in this situation. I’m concerned it may happen again, and who knows if he blames any discomfort on my treatments and sues. Would you think it’s ok to discharge patient and recommend other OP facilities in town?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Very disrespectful. You could send her to another clinician or have family members sit out in the waiting area to provide some space to work with the client. The only time I allow family members to be in the session is if I’m doing family training.

> **Response 2:** Respect is a must. We can talk, argue, etc. but scream at me and you are discharged

Referral networking feedback needed:

I just stopped by a fairly large OB/GYN group in my area looking to drop my business card off and potentially talk to the referral manager. They told me they normally have people bring lunch for their physicians and basically do a presentation for them. Do y’all think that it’s worth forking out the money for the food?

Update: Looks like the general consensus is run away and put my time and money elsewhere. I agree. There were many alarm bells going off inside me, but it took hearing from ya’ll for me to listen to them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Much better use of time and money…. and other places to go.

> **Response 2:** I've owned a  practice for almost 12 years and I also started and ran POPTS (sorry, former life) clinics. I can tell you after years of doing this as a provider looking for business and sitting in on lunches for other providers, especially PT's coming in it's a complete and utter waste of time and they don't give a rats ass about you all they care about is what they're getting to eat

I’ll be competing with a brand new StretchZone that just opened about 3 weeks ago in literally THE EXACT spot that I was eyeing to have as my space. So, my question is, are targeted Facebook ads effective? I’ve had ads for StretchZone pop up in my Facebook feed yesterday and today, so obviously they think so. But if I had to pump money somewhere, would I be better off with Facebook or doing a large direct mailing campaign?

Also, if anyone is so inclined, I’d love honest feedback on my website. Thanks! (www.stretch-ability.com)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To be honest. We have more leads in our FB than waiting for MD referrals. So go with FB ads. Good luck! Love the name!!

> **Response 2:** Good job adding this Abby Regan .As someone who has added a whole suite of wellness and recovery services to my new brick & mortar, you did the right thing if you plan to go brick & mortar soon. Do not open a regular brick & mortar with just PT. You can just rent a gym space for just PT. If you want a traditional retail space you need to pursue your stretch initiative plus more in addition to PT. Good luck!

I am currently a PTA working full time in home health but I have experience in almost every setting. I consider myself a pretty good PTA. Before I was a PTA I was a personal trainer for almost 10 years, and the top trainer at my gym for a while. I’ve been working out all my life pretty much. I’ve had multiple patients ask me to work with/train them after being dc d. 
     I want to help more people, but get paid more. I’m considering going down to PRN and starting my own thing. I would advertise as a personal trainer but also use corrective exercises, posture exercises, etc. I have a really nice home gym, I could go to there home and I have things to take to there house, or I could do online training if they needed that. 
     I feel like this could be a good small business for myself? What do you all think? Any past personal trainers turned into therapist ever thought about this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** David Bayliff who in the group is the PTA that is totally crushing it right now at his gym?

> **Response 2:** Physical therapist turned trainer. Do it as a side gig, LLC, insured, out of my house. Less paperwork and my clients WANT to work. Win win!! Do it!

Hi everyone, I’m currently about to launch online fitness programs via an app- EverFit. The programs will be specifically marketed to the mountain bikers in my community here in Denver. I’m looking for help and guidance to how to better design the programs- as clients will have varying access to equipment as well as fitness levels. If anyone has good resources on program design, please lmk!  Feel free also to check out the exercise demonstrations I’ve created and give me feedback- Rowdy Ryder Rowdy Ryder Academy on YouTube. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Would love to hear how this goes! I do running & triathlon coaching on the side and am about to start using the same app for virtual strength coaching. I’ve been putting strength programs into training peaks for my endurance athletes but have lately been getting some more requests for just strength coaching. 

I found studying for my CSCS super useful for program design. Honestly just reading through the NSCA text book was huge for me!

> **Response 2:** Check out Matt Mooney and MTB Fitness. I'd look on YouTube first. He's out of England and has workouts with minimal equipment. Good luck with your endeavors!

Pt referred to PT with order 2-3x/wk x 12 wks…..

Pt discharged less than 4 wks ago after couple months tx with max potential reached……

PT eval concludes no skilled tx needed as no functional decline noted . (obviously pt is upset about it as they think PT is personal trainer from insurance) 

Now,
Question 1: does this make physician upset as well? 
Question 2: did PT do anything wrong? 
Question 3: how would you explain this to the pt as physician order specified the frequency and duration already?

All input appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PT determines frequency and duration, not the physician based on medical necessity. If the PT decides 1x/wk for 4 wks before DC or 3x/wk on 1st follower by 2x/wk on 2nd wk. It is up to the evaluating therapist. The physician will not protect you if insurance or Medicare determines that you are over utilizing or abuse of the services.

> **Response 2:** PT determines the frequency. It's their professional judgement and treatment plan. Writing frequency on a referral is old school. If the patient's goals are met, they are done. Good opportunity to educate the physician if they are upset about it. I would guess it's just built into their EMR and they don't even care how many visit happen as long as the patient is better.

Non-compete question! 

I’m looking at working PRN at a home health company while I work toward becoming independent with my mobile services - the non compete they want me to sign is making me question doing this! Both of our services are in the home and I was hoping to have clients from HH transition to my cash services when HH services were completed if able, but it states I can’t see past, current, or future clients from 9 months from my termination…help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So let me make a distinction. There is a difference between opening your own practice (non compete), and taking their company’s resources (non solicitation). They can absolutely come after you for solicitation of their clients while an employee of their company. Clients are the $$ of a company. Each valued at approximately $150 per referral in marketing costs. Taking clients would be considered stealing proprietary information and they could win a monetary amount for whatever their ROI is for that client.

> **Response 2:** I would double check with them on this. Because it could be a win-win. You could refer patients to your company after Home health once they have been discharged. And it's two separate services home health and outpatient, which don't necessarily compete with each other.

My business is 2 years old. It’s a small business. 

I find the majority of my referrals come from word of mouth and other small business owners, not large hospital-owned physician practices. 

Talking with a guy starting his food truck this morning. Asked him about his business & where he had a sign made. He asked what I did. 

Now I have an amazing grilled chicken sandwich and a possible referral (or at least some positive vibes).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I found a girl in my neighborhood that is making and selling breakfast sandwiches. I’ve bought some from her twice now. It’s been fun to get to know her, and to have breakfast in the park. And, of course, to support small business!

I’m working with the mother of a friend a friend (cash-based). She is on hospice for end stage pancreatic cancer, but the hospice nurse comes once a week. They were very disappointed to hear that a PT was working with her and they said that Physical Therapy should not be done at this stage. I am working on comfortable sleeping positions, gait training to the bathroom, which has a step up, suggestion of grab bars, AROM to tolerance, teaching the home attendants and the 24 hour people (that are not nurses ) how to transfer safely. Why is this considered a poor choice as per hospice care? ￼￼ the woman is walking and talking, able to carry on a full conversation, consents to exercise, feels much better when we are finished and sleeps more soundly Post RX.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are doing a wonderful job supporting your client at a most meaningful time in their life. You are adding safety and quality of life.  Do not doubt your service to them in any way.  I work in oncology rehab and have worked with many clients to very near the end of their days. Whatever is most important to your client is what matters most.  Your hospice provider in this case is misinformed.  Many hospices would totally support the work you are doing. Thank you for your work in supporting this person in their most challenging days. Not many are able to do that.

> **Response 2:** Because if it's "medically necessary" then they have to pay for it. 😀

I cannot find it now but one of the FB PT message boards (I really thought it was this one), someone asked about a client with poor balance and an arm issue not being able to flush the commode. 

And I just saw this on instagram. I hope they find this… and I hope this doesn’t mess up everyone’s Instagram algorithm.

Big question for ones who are practice with a gym and is hybrid:

A new gym opened, offering a PT room to solely just one PT.  They’re charging a rate of $2,000/mo and do not take any percentages and have only on PT on site for the gym.

Still being a new practice and currently mobile, the gym itself is an ideal set-up, but I’m still trying to build clientele. I believe the gym is 18,000sq ft and trainers would refer their clients to me. 

I’m just anxious of having that big of a monthly payment with low clientele. Wanting to build it up first. 

Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have this exact set up. But in my opinion $2000 is way too high. I would try to negotiate a lesser amount. $1200 max. Or try to negotiate a cost per visit so the gym is incentivized to send you clients.

> **Response 2:** Maybe explain your concerns and negotiate an “on ramp” period where you might pay like $1000 the 1st month, then $1500 the 2nd month, then the full amount to give your time to build up your clientele and income?

Yet another example how this company is not selling "therapy" and is probably doing really well. I have no idea of these concepts are research based because I'm not a PT or one who specializes in runners, but they sound fancy and impressive which I'm sure helps their marketing even more. I even went a step further to figure out what the heck s "Functional Practitioner" is and still don't know.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Devil’s advocate here. Am I the only one who wants to throat punch people wielding the “evidence based” cudgel? Same for the posture and mechanics don’t matter crowd. At the end of the day people don’t give 💩💩and a flying f… about your degree, certifications, etc. They want results. I work virtually with sporty kids all over the place with various issues, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms that mechanics matter very much. Many have been to multiple different medical and non medical folks before reaching out.  PRRT is one of the techniques I use with these folks and many boards push back on certification of the CEUs because of insufficient “evidence”. Tell me it doesn’t work when I can drop jaws from 11,000 miles away, or when a woman’s back pain for 5 years after a hip replacement is gone in about 30 seconds from several hundred miles away? If they’re helping people, then good for them. That being said I’ve seen some of their ads, but haven’t looked all that deep into their stuff.

How many of you have used a digital marketing agency and are satisfied with the results?

Looking to get into the Meta/Google ads world, but no idea where to start. Hoping to find an affordable marketer who can manage and run the campaigns. I know there are a lot of them out there, and many are not good. What have been your experiences? If your super happy with yours, can you drop their contact info?

Thank you kindly!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Who are you trying to reach with Google/Meta ads? A local audience or a broader range of potential clients? 

My recommendation for Meta ads is Kwadwo. (Pronounced Quay-jo). I met him at a business conference and I really like his down-to-earth nature. I believe he would tell you if ads were going to be a waste of money or if it was the right move for your business. 

Here's his IG: 
https://www.instagram.com/quayjo/
He also had a podcast where you can get to know him more. Be sure to listen to the story of how he and his family were living in China but then got stuck in Mexico when Covid broke out - the wildest story ever!) 

I'm an OT and now run a marketing agency (focused on email marketing and sales funnels, plus a little LinkedIn ghostwriting). I've heard from way too many clinicians that the generic marketing agencies never really "got them", and the results were disappointing. It's a recurring theme in my discovery calls and it makes me so mad.

Most of the bigger agencies have someone who does the sales calls, and that person may understand... but then they subcontract it out to a cheap writer/designer who is just trying to get it done as fast as possible. They use ChatGPT to "understand" your specialty, but miss the mark with the messaging. 

I've also been targeted by a lot of PT clinic ads that are totally irrelevant to me since I don't live anywhere near them. So you're smart to find someone who can do ads well instead of "spray and pray"!

> **Response 2:** Speak with David Bayliff and Will Boyd. They will point you in the right direction

I went to a local sales conference today. 9-1. Cost me $50. Made multiple contacts and will interview 3 of the presenters for my local podcast. 

Connected with a local university head of PR. Local AI expert I knew, but had no idea what he did. Local sponsorship salesman who knows when all the other networking events are locally. 

Get out there and meet people.

**Community Responses:**

Voice business account. My admin downloaded the voice app on her phone and were logged into the same account. When the phone rings, it rings on both our lines but during her work hours, she picks up. I like seeing the calls
Coming in. Texts and voicemails are accessible to us both.

> **Response 2:** Ring central. Voice over IP. I have it as an app on my personal phone. So they ring separately. I can silence my work number. I have a work line and fax line

I manage all of that daily while my husband working hard! Last week I talked to David Bayliff and told him I am little slow but it’s okay I continue working on relationships and keep in touch with all my clients because I believe it’s KEY 🔑 to be successful. Guess What? I got 2 more referrals from past clients both 1 is ultra runner and one just active individual. I already saw 1 and sold a 10 pack and he schedule out 7/10 sessions already. 🤯🤯🤯🤯 I even raised my price and client had no problems!!! He saw a value ! He felt better in 1 sessions ! Did I fix him!! Noooo! I listened to him and his concerns ! I made him feel important and empower him to change his health!!! 

I am seeing a ultra runner today !!! 

What I am trying to say !! Keep taking  small steps and put  yourself out there. Keep showing to local runs / events based on your nitch !! I even bring my son and daughter to community run ! People see I am human and caring for running community !!! 

Have an amazing weekend !! Keep going !! There will be days when you questioned everything but days like this week for me !! I know I am doing EXaCTly what I meant to do !!!

Had a call with a client of ours who applied to be on an entrepreneur tv show. Hundreds of applicants, 60 selected to compete and he won the whole thing. Proud moment as a coach. 

His words “I was so well prepared not just in areas we’ve talked through but how to think through the rest”

Principles and the ability to think. That’s what we work on.

I’m 2 years into running my own mobile part B business and have kept busy schedule throughout this time, however the process of staying busy gets frustrating. I have 2 doctors offices, one social worker and a couple med A therapists who are main referral sources. It seems that unless I’m reaching out with a “hey if you have any patients who are in need of PT, I have immediate availability”, they don’t refer. Feel like I constantly have to nudge and annoy these people, but it works so far. I’ve shown my appreciation by ordering lunch on numerous occasions. They all say they have patients in need of home PT, but yet don’t reach out… anyone else feel the same way/have the same struggles?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You have to realize that those offices see dozens of people like you walk in and out of their offices with luncheons, brochures, etc.  Whether it's from pharm reps, radiology reps, or PTs.  You have to stand out to make sure they think of you first when referring a patient to home PT.  Otherwise it's just another one of many free lunches from a "rep".  Get to know the front desk personnel..those are the people that actually hand the list of PTs to the patients.  I went so far as to offer PT to one of these front desk personnel that needed PT.  Once they see how you stand out from otherwise, they will tell patients to go to you when patients ask, "which PT on this list is the best?"

> **Response 2:** Word of mouth has worked best for me. No md. People tell others

What's the one piece of advice you wish you had when you first started running paid ads?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pay someone to do it. 

They have more data and history to know what works.

> **Response 2:** It’s a choice of paying google or Facebook for ads and time figuring it out…

or paying an agency and ad spend. 

I know that paid ads on social are not usually necessary for smaller practices looking to only generate 25 or so clients a month. 

There are more reliable less costly ways that are a better alternative for many.

Hey friends!!
Can someone give me advice on the best way to go about creating a website that looks professional and is relatively simple to create? Total newbie here with doing this type of thing. We have our logo and domain is secured :) Thank you in advance!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To get off the ground, you really just need a one page website that covers the basics. Then after you’re earning $$ and know your target audience and message more you can expand and add pages. 

You can keep the blog hidden until you want to actually commit to writing consistently. 

I usually recommend Squarespace or Wix for beginners and then you’ll be able to modify things yourself instead of paying a designer. 

You’ll rewrite your website a few times, so don’t put a ton of pressure on yourself for the first version. Just make sure the feel and message are on point for your target audience.

**Original Post:**
ISOLATION: The second great killer of your business 

You weren't meant to do THIS alone and by "THIS" I don't just mean business. 

Scenario 1: I hate when people outside a select few friends ask me how business is going. It doesn't seem fair to have to communicate something as complicated as an entrepreneur's emotions. It's great, it's terrible, it's ok, it's frustrating, it's exhilarating, it's everything at the same time. So most of the time people ask I simply say "it's going well" and leave it at that. 

The problem with this? It puts you on an island feeling that no one can possibly understand or know what you're going through. 

Scenario 2: there's something that's been engrained in you from your childhood- using other people to help you is cheating, you need to do it on your own, group projects are awful, and if you collaborate with someone it cheapens what you're accomplishing. 

All of these things have gone through my head from time to time. I want to prove to everyone that I can do it on my own and don't need to rely on support or help from outsiders. "I didn't borrow money from a wealthy family member to get started." "I'm the reason people are coming to my practice." "I'm going to see how far I can get it on my own before asking for help." 

Phrases like this are so prevalent in our culture. 

Both of these scenarios create a pattern of isolation that make us susceptible to a number of problems. We burn out because we can't sustain the level of energy we're putting in. We quit because there's no accountability to push through challenges. We feel depressed because we're alone. 

At the very least you don't need to do this alone but the honest truth is that doing this alone is irresponsible. Don't let yourself become susceptible to isolation. Surround yourself with community to support you and allow you to have the greatest opportunity to have true success.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good timing. Rough day!

> **Response 2:** Perfect timing for this!  Ty! 
I’m a bit tired of the island lately ❤️

Phone service.

I haven't seen any updated posts in a while.  I'd be curious on opinions for multiple people.  Cost effective, no landline, HIPAA compliant phone, texts, call forwarding, etc.  Also, don't need another fax system but do need my phone number ported over.

Any input on these:
-iplum (not seeing good reviews)
-Google voice (haven't heard all good things)
-Grasshopper (don't know much about it)
-sideline
-8x8
-any other good ones?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I enjoy my Google Voice. Very rarely do I have any issues. It’s connected to my gmail so that I also get an email if I have a missed call or a text message.

> **Response 2:** Not a huge fan of Ring Central. Complex.

For mobile therapists that went to brick and mortar did you notice patients taking you "more seriously"?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had the opposite! My one client took her physician's suggestion to try a "traditional physical therapy office" because they have more equipment blah blah blah.... well I encouraged her and said you know what give it a try, you never know. Well she called me last night saying she was paying a 40 copay for her to be passed around or being alone to do stupid exercises such as marching and standing side leg lifts...when she could have just stated with me to not waste time. She's angry with the physician and plans to tell her physician about how in home is fantastic because you have the sole providers full attention without distraction.

> **Response 2:** We had a strong following that went from renting out space in a gym and doing some private calls for $$$. Then covid happened and we went pure mobile.  Then got our own space   

Each time the business leveled up so to speak we saw a great deal of increased respect.  Especially from other providers.   

But when my wife and I had our first kid. Patients that previously would t pay for the cash services just changed over quickly.  “You have little mouths to feed… I will pay extra for extra quality “   
Keep in mind these are patients that had known my wife and I 10 years from dating to engaged to married to married with children.

Hello All , I just opened my own practice last week. Did my first lunch meeting yesterday and booked 3-4 in next 2 weeks . 
Any other statigy would you guys recommend to get patients.
 Little disappointed

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My goal when I started was to talk to 5 new people every day.  I would attend networking groups, meet other PTs or OTs that do home health, gym owners.   
Set up free info talks at libraries, gyms (wherever you feel like your audience is located).  
Attend and participate in local health fairs and talk to the everyone.  
You are on the right track so far if you already have 3-4.  Keep it going!

> **Response 2:** I think I have had a handful of patients from meetings with doctors in the past 5 years. The majority of my referrals came from word of mouth from other patients. I had many referrals from home care PTs who had to DC people that still needed care but couldn’t get to a clinic. Try reaching out to any friends who are Homecare therapists. I also talked to all of my friends and family about my business in the beginning and they referred people to me. Also it’s not always a popular option but my caseload doubled once I accepted Medicare.

Thought I'd share a win. 
Client that I've been seeing for a few months. Started off as Mc client. Went to self pay bc not medically necessary according to those standards. Had a stroke 6 months ago. 
Is now playing tennis 6 days a week. 
Clay courts  and opened up to full court recently with his trainer who didn't think he'd be able to ever do that again. 
Footwork is improving weekly. 
Working on timing of ue and le movements for the game. 
He's a very good athlete with underlying compensations as all of us have and it made me smile to know we're reaching goals that he and I have and had. 
A challenging case but that's why we do this right????

What do you think about this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a former LMT of 15 years before I become an OT I do have some concerns. 

1. My biggest concern is that stretching recommendations changed in 2015 and not a lot of massage therapists or other therapists are very well informed about it. Stretching too much can actually increase risk of injury. Massage therapists, personal trainers etc are not trained nor can prescribe stretching protocols. 
2. It has morphed into something much more than stretching. 
3. We should absolutely be lobbying some of these stretch labs especially ones that use resistance bands like the example provided in the link:

https://www.instagram.com/reel/CiAhDFEDpva/?igsh=MXJwZW45bjQ4eThwag==

> **Response 2:** Stretch Lab is a national franchise that hires PTAs, trainers and h to e like to do manual stretch sessions on people. Whole body 30-60 minutes basically for people who don’t want to do the work at home. I know PTAs who have switched bc no insurance, documentation or exercise prescription. Like the massage therapists of stretching. They stretch you and you go. Come again and see someone else whatever. 
PT does a terrible job of defining and protecting our scope

If you needed 15 new clients tomorrow, what would you do?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great question…Go to a gym with lots of people and set up a sign on a table that says: “The first 15 people who want to get stronger, move better, and hit your goals in the gym, I’ll treat you for one visit for FREE to see how this is possible. First come, first served.”

Then, get their appointments set up. Treat them once, and convert them all to packages.

PLEASE POKE HOLES IN THIS

I made a 2-page intro document for RPE and "zones" training. I want it to be something I can post on my website or send directly to potential clients. It needs to be accurate of course, but also simple and approachable with no pressing questions afterward.

HELP. I have a tricky situation to navigate. There is a new functional medicine/wellness center that really wants to partner with us to be able to offer cash PT. We like them a lot as people and like their mission, but idk if they really know how a business works. They want to charge a monthly rent that is a little above market value for the space (linens, EMR, front desk, basic equipment, and some other minor things are included in that) but then take 20%%%%%% of our profit. 

I've never been in a sublease situation before, but I don't know what business takes that much of a cut if they aren't providing that much extra service or referrals to the leasee. They also have no idea how many referrals they could give and I assume I will need to do most of the hustle for marketing. 

Feel free to comment or ask questions!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No percentage usually. Rent only

> **Response 2:** I will be a little more blunt, as Kelley Ryan said...NO!  rent higher than market plus 20% rake on profit?? that's a nicely disguised kick back...and you would be partially caged in my opinion.  

 Your niche' is womens health and that specialty is so in demand.  If you are good at what you do, and I'm sure you are, you will be more than fine.  rent out a room in an office and spend your time on marketing ob/gyn's,  primary care MD's, physiatrists, new mom's groups etc.  word of mouth will spread like wildfire.  you will crush it.

Looking for some feedback on this situation: I've been subletting from a private gym for a while now and it's been great-- until another PT owner tried to plant themselves in the space too. The gym put them off for a few months, but now they are going back on their word to me and told the other business they could see a client there. Is this a "tough ish, that's business" situation? Is this the market now? While I understand it's not personal, it's business...I guess I had more faith in professionals respecting each other's spaces. Tell me I'm wrong and I will get over it 🤣

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I signed a lease and the lease has exclusivity rights to avoid competition. Not sure if theres a way you could talk to them and see if you could get something like that? But end of the day, it unfortunately is business. I would either leave or just make sure you have clear marketing and start establishing who your clear ideal client is.

> **Response 2:** My business mentor had a similar issue and ended up leaving due to the personal relationship falling apart. 

I’ve worked out of 2 gyms and each time the expectation was that I was the “exclusive” physical therapist at the space. I give preference to clients at the space with either financial discounts or priority scheduling. 
If you have already been doing that and this still happened, my recommendation is to see if the relationship really benefits you or if you’re just using the space. 

Do they refer to you regularly? Are they using your presence at the gym to market and generate revenue? Are you regularly working with the personal trainers in the space to ensure their clientele doesn’t fall off due to injury? 

If the space is benefiting more than you, I’d consider leaving. If not and it’s fairly even, try having a more direct conversation about the logistics of your business relationship and get things in writing. 

Good luck 👍🏻

**Practice for Sale**

**Clinic Location: West Florida (Tampa-Sarasota Area)**

**Clinic Summary:**

Husband and Wife Owned/Lead PTs

80- 90% caseload booked-consistently for the last 2 years 

Brick and Mortar Hybrid Practice Medicare+Cash ($200 per session) 

Great local relationships for exclusive referrals 

**Why I'm Selling:**
Due to family relocation to our dream state/life (more of a mountain people vs beach lol) and being closer to relatives as we grow our family, I’m seeking to pass the baton to someone who can take this clinic to the next level. Our move-out date will be mid-2026, so I’m being proactive in finding the right person to ensure a smooth transition. I’d love to be involved during the handover to ensure everything stays seamless for my clients and referral partners.

While I have no expectations of a high price, I’m looking for someone who appreciates the value of this fully functioning business and can continue to build upon the solid foundation already in place.

This clinic has consistently profited, is well-loved by the community (>110 5-star google reviews), and has the potential for even greater success with the right clinician or owner.

Comment below interested and i’ll send you a message for a quick chat and more info about our profitability and KPIs

This seems so basic, but how do you actually drop off marketing materials to referring clinicians/mds?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Something off beat or off the wall like a shock and awe package.
Having written a book on your expertise works well, because it takes up physical space on their desk or shelf, but stays subconsciously in the mind. 
Mail a package of peanuts directly to the doctor with a flyer saying “You’d be nuts not to work with us”
A rubber foot saying “I’ve done the hard work for you and got my foot in the door…now here’s how we can work with each other to benefit our patients”
If you have a local podcast, getting them on as a guest then opening the 2 way street is a good one.

> **Response 2:** Here's my process (I'll probably get a million comments saying I'm doing it wrong but....). When I go in, I only bring one form of marketing materials, letter, brochure, card, so I have excuses to come back and drop off more. When I go in, I ask the front desk person their name and if I can drop off materials for the doctor (s). Always respect their level of busy-ness. If they have time for small chitter-chatter while I get out the materials, then that's fine. As soon as I leave the office, I write down the name of the front desk person and any little details they said (going on vacation soon, only work in the mornings, etc). I then put in my calendar when I'll be coming back to drop off more info. On the return visit, I say hello to the front desk person by name and say something about our last conversation (how was your vacation? I came in the morning because I knew you'd be here....) While dropping off different marketing materials from the last time, I try to get some Intel from the front desk (would I be able to schedule a meeting with the doc? How does your office handle PT referrals? Etc). It's a snowball process of getting the trust of the front desk, the gatekeepers. So you can get in to see the MDs face to face.

Good Morning Guys,
I was wondering how effective is it to pay some one $1400 for marketing each month including SEO, Bloggong and Google Ads too? Also there is $2000 initiate up fees and 12 months contract…. I am a small practice and looking forward to bring my side hassle to a full time work… is it worth? Or should I hire someone to do my SEO? Want to hear what others have done and are doing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Better question is can you handle it. I’d be shooting myself in the foot. My people are nearly maxed out and I’m thankful I got a new hire Tuesday starting in January. It would be too much

> **Response 2:** I hesitate to agree with contracts that long, I would ask how they are going to demonstrate success and what happens after the 6 month mark if there is no difference in your bottom line.  I went thru something like this about a year ago, and would honestly not repeat it.  I would rather spend the time to learn it and then do it vs pay someone who, fingers crossed, is actually going to do their job

I’m having a hard time with phone service. I was using google voice which was dropping calls frequently when I tried to answer. I switched to iPlum and now when I answer the phone sometimes there’s around 25 seconds where we can’t hear each other. 

I’m considering paying more for Nextiva. Does anyone know if it works better than the others?

**Community Responses:**

During the past three days I was blessed to host a small group of the UNCAGED CLINICIAN Mastermind students. 

A HUGE THANK YOU to my wife, Cara Bayliff, who took care of outings and meal prepping, and to Hannah Legare (DeGroot) who planned and led the retreat!! 🙏🙌

While they were here to learn from Hannah, UNCAGED’s personal development coach, and me, we were inspired by them. 

That is certainly a trait of a successful practice owner - their ability to inspire others. 

It’s amazing to know that I have the honor of helping these, and many other business owners like them, to discover and to develop their personal legends.

In doing so, they not only create massive impacts in their communities, but they also generate the abilities to authentically live in their personal “Why’s”. 

As I listened to each one’s reflection last night, each was ready and eager to move the needle two steps forward.

The cool thing is that it wasn’t a “new tactic” that excited them.

Rather, it was their respective personal introspection that showed them their next steps. 

For that, I could not be more excited or proud for each one of them.

Has anyone had luck advertising in a neighborhood magazine?   it is about $800 per month with 1 year commitment.  It’s my target audience, and right by my clinic, but I hate that 1 year!  They won’t negotiate with that at all!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Put that 💰 toward social media ads targeted to within 5 or 10 miles of your clinic. No one reads magazines and if they do they are skipping over the ads. Spend a quarter of that budget on social media. I spend 200 a month on a video I made myself (tons of YouTube tutorials to show you how to do it and how to set the add to a targeted area or demographic and how to set your ad budget etc) and I get at least 1 new patient a month from it.

Need help organizing my thoughts:

Earlier this month I left my job for personal reasons including taking care of my health and recovering from stress/burnout. 

The goal is to start developing my own gig slowly as I get ready to work again.

Problem is I have so many interests and not enough experience (about 14 months PT experience).

I think I want to start with offering PT, run coaching (am a certified run coach), and personal training/fitness coaching(no CPT cert yet). I already have two running clients (for free in return for feedback and word of mouth referral should they enjoy our work together). As for PT have yet to reach out to some local gyms and also considering mobile at home. Not to mentiontion other interestss i have and May eventually get more trainingg in…

I am just struggling to identify whether I am spreading myself too thin trying to start in all these fields and also what a cash based treatment schedule/programming could look like- i.e all in person PT/in person and virtual, run coach fees. I feel like personal training/fitness coaching is more straightforward. Then can I just put all these services under one LLC, do I need to keep anything separate. It’s just me….

Too many thoughts when I just want to jump in!

Mobile Therapists: How are you guys dealing with the anxiety of going to people’s homes? So I’ve been doing home health for a while and haven’t had trouble with it, but the referral always comes from a hospital or physician, etc. As a private practice, if I get a direct access, private paying patient, anyone could call me with any motive. Has anyone had a safety issue?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have been mobile for two years without issue. My practice is all word of mouth so there is always a connection to someone I know. 
Also just because someone is in the hospital being referred doesn’t always mean it’s safe. You still never know what you’re walking in to.

> **Response 2:** Search for past discussion on this. Word of mouth referrals kept me safe. I also screen everyone on the phone first, usually at least a 15 min phone call. If I’m going into a new situation, I’ll put pepper spray in my pocket/bag. 

In home health some of our nurses carried tazers. 

There’s a great book called The Gift of Fear.

**Original Post:**
So what is the absolute minimum you need to start to see patients on your own mobility or in home? 
My husband and I are planning to start our own cash side gig and hopefully grow it to a full time thing. 

Also how important is a social media presence because I am not a fan of posting things. Our kids are heavily involved in the community through church, sports, ect and we've coached a lot of teams and plan to market through our social networks of people we know in these areas and start there.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Liability and malpractice insurance are musts as well. 
I had treatment table
EmR 
Cleaning supplies (wipes, purel)
Fascia free 
Resistance bands
Balance pad
And the most important is your brain and how your evaluate and educate patients. 

My business has been mostly word of mouth and the occasional shoutout on some local community FB groups. Went from 2 days a week to five days a week In about 8 months and I see about 20-25 visits a week.
I’m fully mobile

> **Response 2:** To the best of my knowledge Ive never gotten any business from social media origin. 10.5 months running and I just entered patient #160   Most is word of mouth followed by HH agency referrals followed by me pursing a group of homes w developmental disabled adults.

David Bayliff is thankfully my friend and I get to talk to him a lot! Today, he called to encourage me and gave me some tips on getting in front of my ideal client. 

I did what he said and 30 mins later I scheduled 2 workshops at a gym and a yoga studio. 

He is the BEST! He’s honest and has a HUGE heart!!!

Hello! Where is everyone posting to hire a PT these days?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Indeed. I don’t love it but have tried most everything and it’s the only one I consistently get resumes from. We do hire a lot tho (3-4 therapists monthly on average). Indeed seems to be only one to have enough volume but is wildly over priced for ads IMO

> **Response 2:** We tried indeed and LinkedIn, never got good applicants. My entire staff of 13 clinicians is from word of mouth/having a strong reputation.

How do you go about trying to regain a doctors office’s attention after a lull of no referrals? One office sent to me right off the bat and the doctor said he likes to support entrepreneurs. I dropped off some doughnuts and a card thanking them and haven’t gotten another referral since! Would like to try and get their attention again. Advice/thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've honestly had better luck going straight to the patient. My patients then go tell their providers

> **Response 2:** James DiPiazza  go with a patient to their appointment. Shows the doc you're invested, helps the patient out, and you look good to both. Score some free 1:1 (2:1) time with the doc. I gotta give credit to Anthony Maritato for this.

Thoughts?  Saw this posted on a FB page for a concierge physician.  I never introduce myself as doctor, but I periodically have patients call me doctor.  I try to explain the difference, but this article steps into muddy territory.  From the article seems the NP clearly stated her degree online.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** funny...never had my chiro nor dentist have to tell me they are such after calling themselves Dr.

> **Response 2:** Chiros always verbally introduce themselves as doctors and Ive never heard them having to pay a ridiculous fine like this.  On a side note, I believe PTs need to do a better job with introducing themselves as doctors, as it helps a lot with bringing more perception of value in what we do.

***Stick with me here...***

What YOU can pull from the recent *Cracker Barrel* fiasco.

Cracker Barrel has been an iconic establishment since first opening its doors in Lebanon, TN in 1969.

One can drive along any highway and find a packed Cracker Barrel parking lot.

To so many, it has been a place of comfort food; reminding them of going to their grandmother's for Sunday lunch.

With the founder, "Uncle Herschel", now no longer with us, the company decided to hire a marketing firm to ensure its continued success.

This is where things went south for the company.

Again, *stick with me...*

There was a major uproar nation wide over the proposed changes.

The very loyal customer fan base let their displeasure be known, and in a very short amount of time, Cracker Barrel LOST $100M in revenue.

Yes, **$100 MILLION**.

What was really the culprit for the people who love Cracker Barrel to become disenfranchised with the company?   Cracker Barrel became disconnected with the people who willingly drove an extra few miles down the road to receive what they had to offer.

Deeper still, it was the fact that a marketing firm convinced the store to build something that they (the marketing firm) wanted to create.

Do you think said marketing firm understood Cracker Barrel's customers? Nope.

The result?  Unhappy customers feeling as though they had no where to go.

***How does this relate to you?***

If you are looking to build your own practice, *UNCAGED CLINICIAN* works with you to build the business YOU want. 

One that *YOUR* customers will want to come to.

We don't offer a cookie cutter plan, nor do we even attempt to convince someone of building something that *we* want them to build.

*It's your business serving your customers.*  

We not only like it that way; we want it that way.

If going from employee to practice owner to CEO is tugging strong at your heart, now is the time to take action.

We have created a whole new ***UNCAGED UNIVERSITY*** to help you as you build your dream.

Experts on reading X-rays can you tell me what is wrong with the hip. TIA
Update- I uploaded better X-ray quality. I think pic was taken at wierd angle.  I have not seen this patient. Patient is family friend who is visiting USA and X-ray were taken in India. Ortho said that she has problem with her SI joint and that is from birth. Her symptoms are pain over low back pain, gluteal muscles and hamstrings.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The hip is the acetabulofemoral joint. Is that what you are asking about? X-rays are one piece of the puzzle. What clinical presentations are there? Symptoms? Injury? Age? Reason for seeking PT? Movement impairments? Etc.

> **Response 2:** Poor quality film…would not base symptoms/presentation off of this alone.

Any advice on how to explain to a physician that the normal 2-3 sessions/week for 6 weeks for physical therapy isn’t always necessary? I treated a young athlete for 5 sessions (1x for 5 weeks). Patient has met all goals and able to dance without pain or dizziness. Her physician is concerned because i didn’t have her complete 12 sessions and wants the patient to continue to finish 12 sessions.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In my opinion it's the perfect time to market yourself as a clinician that emphasizes individualized treatment and goals that allow your patients to get better in fewer visits than what is considered standard. Don't be afraid to separate yourself from the pack.

> **Response 2:** If the patient met their goals, no symptoms, and back to PLOF why is the physician concerned?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes.

> **Response 2:** What Chris said, and you don't want to just throw spaghetti at the wall for ads. It'll get real expensive fast with little return. Get your systems straight first, then get your ad copy right. And be sure they are setup correctly ie audience, geographic area, etc. William Boyd is a great resource for this and if he can't help you, he can point you to who can. You def need to learn the ad platforms and copywriting before putting money in.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used Google Voice for 4.5 years of my business.  The only issue I ever had was I was sending out a repetitive text to my clients and it locked me out because it thought I was spamming.  We had to do some work to regain the number again... Just be careful.  GOOD LUCK!

*For anyone that started as a mobile side hustle*

1. Did you purchase an EMR at the beginning? Wondering if I should prior to seeing my first patient.

2. What marketing seemed to work best at the beginning? I have a website that I plan on linking (via QR code) to business cards but interested in learning what YOU did to help you get started. My plan is to post on several local FB groups but I’m willing to do anything. I assumed it’d be smarter to wait on Google ads/FB ads/etc until after I get a few established patients/reviews.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got Jane app before patients. I wanted scheduling, payment, reminders, intake, etc through one platform and I felt like it looked more legit. They have a helper discount if you’re under 10 patients a month

> **Response 2:** I built a google sheet EMR and then sold it lol so no you deff don’t need one. They’re honestly built for billing insurances and that’s it

As far as marketing - Shake hands and kiss babies. Nothing beats just shaking hands and kissing babies lol (networking)

**Original Post:**
I am an OT and I am interested in starting a cash-based wellness business for adults (mostly 50+ based on demographics where I am). Not interested in dealing with insurance at all - so strictly focusing on wellness. Several years ago I had my own, small private mobile OT business and I am having trouble shifting my mindset! 🤯

💡 Would love to hear about other wellness based businesses - what services/programs do you offer? 
📚 How do you highlight your OT/PT skills and knowledge while clearly indicating that you are not providing that skilled therapy? 

Example I encountered just in conversation about starting to see clients privately -  someone who is about 3 months post-stroke w lingering hemiparesis, living home independently.   This person would certainly benefit from skilled services  (postural alignment, quality of movement, strength)- how to you draw the line and what would make your services “wellness” vs OT/PT. 
… I can 100% agree with an argument that a very knowledgeable personal trainer could provide appropriate exercise for this patient. BUT - as a licensed OT, would I be crossing a line?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is basically what my business is. I’m a PT, and my take on wellness is a) if someone could learn what I’m teaching in a weekend, it’s not skilled and therefore not PT, and b) if there’s no specific diagnosis that I’m working on it’s not PT. 

I like to say I’m doing personal training with a PTs eyes.

> **Response 2:** Think of recreation vs necessity. Medicare doesn't care if people can golf, play pickleball, etc for example. They want function: just get to the toilet, don't fall, etc. Your client wants to do more than basic function, so make it clear that in your practice that= wellness. Also clearly state on your website that you do not take insurance and that your "wellness" work is  to make the enjoyment of life better. Hope that helps. I struggled here too, but now am good with thinking wellness is anything over basic function. Good luck in the new practice.

I started my mobile PT business with just me, I have done all the billing, schedule, marketing, insurance verification, treatments,.etc myself. I have grown fast where I can't keep up with referrals and have finally started hiring PTs to provide services. I want to stay on the business side of things but don't want to do the social media aspect of marketing. I want to start looking for someone to keep up with social media, my question is how do you pay someone? Do you pay by the hour, the post...any feedback is greatly appreciated. I feel like my biggest limitation in running a business is being unsure how to pay people for different aspects. As a PT, I get paying PTs 😊 but there's so many business components?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Literally why I switched to using StrataPT. It's a comprehensive all in one emr and billing system that specially has a mobile practice set up. So I wear less business hats and spend less time with verification, denials, etc and more time treating or relaxing.

> **Response 2:** Not to jump on here but could I ask message you about how you started your business??

What characteristics or actions do you see in common with your most successful students?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1) Belief. When we don’t have to spend time building belief that this will work, and belief in themselves that they can do this, then success comes more quickly.

2) Good communication skills. A huge part of growing your business has to do with clearly and passionately conveying your mission to others in the community. 

3) Confident with selling themself. This usually comes from a belief in themselves, that is transferred over into believing that they truly are the best option for their clients.

That’s all I’ve got for now!

> **Response 2:** Authenticity and trustworthiness

I'm a Pelvic floor therapist treating at a home office. This exchange happened this evening after a new client eval. I'm all at once feeling like maybe... Just maybe... This could work!
Check out my terrible website at www.bottomsuppt.com and offer me all your critical feedback. Seriously, I have no mind at all for this stuff.

Group benefits are given to larger organizations at a discounted rate because there's a larger and more unified voice. 

This is just a small aspect of what we're looking to accomplish with the Uncaged Clinician Community and app. 

We have an audience that other businesses want access to and instead of us just using this audience to get sponsorship and affiliate deals for ourselves, we want to help share those benefits to our community.

What does all this mean and what other benefits are there?

Come to the Uncaged App launch party on March 22 to find out. Register using the link below

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am just now seeing this post and wondering if there are any updates on this community being able to pool resources for group benefits? I just lost out on a stellar candidate for an open position because I couldn't afford to offer health insurance. I spoke with a broker who said small private businesses can't compete with Markrtplace plans and I got a quote from the organization that APTa uses

Does anyone have recommendations/advice on how to do better marketing? Specifically via social media/Instagram to gain folllowers?  I now have online fitness programs up on Everfit app and trying to find ideas on how to better market the programs and gain clients.  Marketing to my womens mountain bike club of 3,500+ ladies hasn’t been enough so far.  😒

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Be consistent, pool your audience to know what they want to know, create content around what they want to know and not what you think they want to know, be consistent and post daily.

> **Response 2:** Don’t overcomplicate it. Just provide value. Post simple videos or text posts answering a common question or issue your clients run into. Do NOT get caught into the trap of trying over explain yourself in your caption (we all do it). Because then it will take you like 45 minutes to make 1 post. Keep things as simple as you can and try to make each post just 1 main thing you are trying to get across. Don’t worry about editing posts or anything. Just post. Show your personality (people work with people they like). See what works and what doesn’t. Go from there. 

Why would somebody want your program? What are they going to get out of it? And I don’t mean “get stronger, more fit, etc etc” because every program ever says that. What actual problem will your program help solve for mountain bikers? What are the things people complain about most often? Stay on the bike longer? No longer need long rest breaks once you get to the top? 

Don’t try to just post stuff on the mountain biking group to market, just be in there a lot and answer questions and show them you are knowledgeable and eventually people will reach out to you. 

Think of social media marketing as farming. Just keep planting seeds, and then eventually you’ll be able to harvest them.

Anyone has had issues with Google reviews not showing up?  My patient left a review last week and it didn't show up.  Anyone has found out why?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So weird. I’ve had that happen too. May have something to do with if you as an owner don’t register using a gmail. My domain is my company name and I’ve had some issues

> **Response 2:** Email support.

Pro tip: if you want reviews which make even a better difference ask the reviewer to post a picture and or use some keywords for your services. 

Also if you’re solely a mobile therapist don’t register an address, use a service area.

**Original Post:**
Hi all.  I'm doing my first vendor event in late April.  It is a street festival, and most of the vendors will be selling food or crafts.

I am a sports/ortho PT (cash-based, no Medicare) and would like to focus on the role of PT in wellness and injury prevention.  My first thought had been to do an injury risk screen, similar to one that I offer once a month at my practice.  I use a self screen, but with the space I have for the event 10x10) can probably only do 2 at a time.

So questions to those who have done outdoor vendor events:

1. What ideas have you used that worked well in getting people to stop at your tent/table?

2. What ideas do you have to turn these leads into clients, preferably ways to collect emails or phone numbers for marketing?  Some thoughts I had were ebook sign-ups, raffle for free session.

3. Is it worth it to have giveaway items, and if so, what did you use?

Thanks in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have events planned for late fall; a 5k and a gravel bike ride.  I plan on doing IASTM and cupping on a portable treatment table while advertising running analysis and bike fitting.  I might try to hand out some chocolate milk for the runners.

> **Response 2:** what about giving away 15-minute personal screens for people to come see you. Usually a screen will land you some patients. And, if they don't take advantage of it, it didn't really cost you much.

Anybody else out there struggling to get new patients? I came out with a bang, but now I haven't had a new patient in months. I had a few evals, but they didn't want to return for follow-ups (I think mainly due to schedule, not anything I did or didn't do, unless they don't want to tell me that). I have done paid ads on facebook, where I get a few messages but never turns into anything. I have done a few workshops and have some coming up in January, but my goal was 15 visits a week, and currently I am at 4, with nothing promising on the horizon.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This time of year is notoriously slow. Our business is often feast or famine. If you are seeing Medicare patients, should be an uptick in referrals after the first of the year. Marketing is everything though. Best wishes!

> **Response 2:** I'm in the same space. It's extremely anxiety inducing. I'm just going to be focused on marketing and making appointments with physicians and their referral schedulers ..

What was your best marketing strategy to date? What has yielded the best return on investment?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Talking to everyone I know, telling my friends and family what I am doing and they have marketed for me. It has just grown by word of mouth from there and I now keep a full schedule.

> **Response 2:** From what I’ve seen/heard from mobile/private practice it’s referrals from happy clients. 

Get super clear on who you’d like to serve and become the “go-to person” for that. Don’t spray and pray with your messaging. 😉 

Also dig into the deeper problems your solving. 

1. Surface level
2. Deeper/intrinsic
3. Societal

1. Knee pain
2. Not being able to care for grandkids without pain
3. Growing older doesn’t mean you have to deal with pain and stop doing the things you love. 

(Just an ortho example of the levels) 😁

**Original Post:**
Hi everyone! I started my own business so that one day I can eventually do my own thing but ended up coming into contact with a solo practitioner whose values align with mine- I love what he is doing with his business. It’s an orthopedic practice, cash based. He hired me on as a contractor as he is in need for a therapist due to good growth! I started with him about 6 months ago but have been struggling to get patients onto my schedule. They know him as the face of the company and I understand it’ll take time for people to know wh￼o I am. I’ve been doing injury screens and plan to run a workshop myself, as well as meeting more people in the community/networking. But can’t seem to get patients! And he keeps taking on new evals/has a waitlist. He’s told me to be patient but starting to wonder what I should be doing differently or if I need to take on PRN work until he can start to fill my schedule. I would love to market more but finding it hard as I’m not making much as is! And need to start contributing more to my finances with my family. Has anyone hired on their first PT as contract and had the same issue with filling schedule? Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have so many questions. First of all, is he paying you to do marketing and workshops? If he hired you to help him, why is he continuing on put new patients on his personal waitlist and not on your schedule? That makes no sense. It’s his responsibility to get patients on your schedule otherwise what’s the point in him having you if he’s just going to keep making his wait list longer. Seems silly to me. 

Secondly, if you are putting in the time and effort to market and network, do workshops…just start your own business. That’s a lot of work to essentially be promoting someone else’s company—go promote your business!

> **Response 2:** Had sort if this same problem at our clinic when we hired.  And the solutuon we used would require his help.  Try observing a patient of his. (I would volunteer this hour of your time)  get to know the patient and then co treat a little.  Then have follow ups scheduled with you.  What i do to this very day when i am trying to get a patient on another PT's schedule is to tell the patient that "jane doe" has avilability and can get you in right away. "She treats me" (which is 100% true)  that line works EVERY time.

Love this!!  I’ve been saying pretty much the same thing about the PT industry for years.



**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Eh. You can grow your own food too, but…I’m all for anything that makes it easier for people to move. Indoors, outdoors, cheap, expensive. I don’t care. Just be healthier. I’ll meet you where you’re at without all the judgement.

> **Response 2:** yes, its not always neccessary. AND this article is very ablelist. 
because not everyone can get down and do pushups. people who use wheelchairs can be super strong with machines and not be able to do much body weight wise. 
people with balance issues benefit from machines. 
cities have vastly changed since 20 years ago, not as much running space and capacity as there used tobe. not to mention that the streets arent neccesarily safe for women jogging outside. and black males running outside would be arrested much more often....
Yes, I am giving extreme examples just to point out that this isnt black and white. and that not thinking of psychosocial factors invoved with gyms and machines can be racist and misogynist.

and also gym culture can be good for the mental health as well. 

Story time: i went to the gym today (cuz im one of those that like the iron culture) and a women saw me doing super set of hamstring curl and pushups. yes i can do pushups at home but thats not as motivating. she says "impressive" and then said that she watched me do hip extension ex on the assisted chinup machine and she wanted to copy me. but then she said "i fractured my ankle really bad. like its destroyed. so im not sure if i will be able to do it well" . so the physio in me said, hmm, are you doing rehab. and thankfully she is. so i said ask your physio to go over step ups with you. its easier, its functional and you dont have to worry about the weight. 
so yes, she can do that at home. and doesnt need expensive machine.
but me doing it at home, wont cut it ;)

I have an interesting case that I want some input on from you all. 

Client complains of pain around the R eye/forehead that happens when he does any type of physical activity or standing up from sitting that lasts 15-45 seconds intensity of 6-9/10 and then goes away to a 0/10. Symptoms are reproduced with resisted left cervical rotation and deep palpation to right upper trap and SCM. He had a nerve block to occipital nerve which seemed to improve his symptoms. MRI of brain negative. Tested for temporal arteritis was negative. Tested BP seated vs standing and all WNL. 

Dry needling to R UT and SCM reproduced his symptoms and then improved after being in for 2-15 min. I haven’t DN suboccipital region. But any type of cervical exertion causes the headaches. 

Any ideas from anyone?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How long has he had pain for?

> **Response 2:** If the occipital nerve block temporarily relieved his symptoms consider nerve entrapment.  If therapy can’t fix him I recommend Tim Tollestrup MD peripheral nerve surgeon.

Hi everyone!
Has anyones google my business account ever been suspended? 😬
Apparently I made too many edits to it at once and it was flagged and suspended for “quality issues” 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
Doing some research, it looks like the appeal process can take two weeks!! That seems like an eternity.
Anyone else been in a similar circumstance? How long did it take for the appeal process?
Also FYI:
I use wix for my website, I made some edits to google my business there but it does not have all the features as it does when you login to google business. I made the changes in wix, then other changes in google. I think this is what suspended my acoount. Be aware and don’t make this mistake! ☺️

**Community Responses:**

I just submitted a reverification request... hoping that does it. But I don't know why, when it got shut down at all..?

> **Response 2:** I put in my phone number and got suspended. it did take like 2 weeks. it was ridiculous. you had to email them to get out back.  Someone posted this number for Google awhile back 844-491-9665

I am a cash-pay mobile ortho PT.  My town has several affluent neighborhoods with their own magazines.  A couple have approached me lately to purchase long-term contracts to run ads monthly.  One has 4K homes, another with 550 (and growing).  Does anyone have experience/advice on this and the ROI?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree with the short term contract. As well as considering other marketing. Do you have a significant list for past patients?  That’s the best people to market to. The main problem with marketing to people is you’re trying to get them to know like and trust you.  The people that are past patients already crossed this bridge.  They’ve also crossed this bridge with their family and friends.  If you can get them to talk about you, that’s where the real magic happens.

> **Response 2:** Done it once and didnt even get a phone call.  It was in 8 different country club magazines.

I agree that Next door is best.   I respond to all posts asking for a local ortho,  rheumatologist, neurologist, etc and then add, if you need PT, I am....

It has worked great and cost nothing out of my pocket.

Have a warm list of around 40 doctors that have consistently referred patients to me and I've yet to formally meet with staff or doctors yet.

Pelvis NYC is in the process of moving to a new and upgraded location.
I will be reaching out to these docs to meet with them. 

I am looking for ideas to bring to their office. I'd like to bring them (staff and physician) products that they can enjoy themselves.

Few ideas:

-Water bottles with our logos on it (everyone lieks free stuff)
-Doctor's note pad with our logo on it
-Script pad with our contact details so they can give their patients the referral note with our info on it.
-Cards with our contact info and a QR code that leads the patient to our website to book a discovery call or visit.
-Clipboards with our logo on it.

So looking for ideas that may be trending better than these. Or if you all think some of these would suffice.

**Community Responses:**

I once had a patient (occupation: sales person) tell me it’s one of the best marketing tools. A pens life span on average will be used by 7 people. 

Simple yet effective.

So a couple of years ago… When I initially wanted to start with getting more consistent with videos, I mentioned something to    Anthony Maritato about it, and he told everyone that I was doing the “March madness challenge“ and basically called me out to do a Facebook live post every day for the month of March. (have to love the public accountability. )

I did it and did fine and enjoyed it and it was fun! 

So, to kickstart myself with creating consistent YouTube content, I was thinking about doing a daily video in the month of March and calling it something like “A month of Mobility in March” I figured I can film a lot of it and schedule the posts to drop on YouTube each day of the month and then do a little teaser or something on Facebook to drive some eyeballs to it.

My question is, is there something I’m missing out on to maximize traffic that I can plan for now as I start filming these videos?

I have a patient that requested medical records for disability. We provided these records and she wants to have a meeting to discuss some “inaccuracies” she sees in the record. I have explained that we can not/will not change the documentation. Am I required to meet with her? Or can I just ask her to email me a list of things she disagrees with and attach them to her medical record so that her concerns are documented?

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
I’ve been connecting with a local DPC/concierge doc, and we want to formally collaborate. She’d like to be able to pipeline her patients to me, but include my service as part of the fee they’re already paying her (so not just a referral, and then they pay for my service). We are trying to figure out how to make this work so that I am also getting paid what I am due. Could this be as simple as the physician paying me out of petty cash from her practice when I see one of her clients, or do we need to go through credenting and billing as if a traditional clinic? Or something else?? Open to ideas … I have been totally solo an fully cash-based practice for several years, so this is new territory!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love that you’re thinking through this before you jump in, because the way you structure it now is what’s going to make this collaboration actually work long term.

There are a few clean ways to look at it.

First option: treat it like you’re getting free leads. If she wants to keep her pricing exactly the same and not rearrange anything, that can still work. The big thing is you cannot let people just show up at your door expecting free ongoing PT. You need a 15 minute phone call with them first so you can set expectations clearly…
“Here’s what the eval normally costs, here’s what this first session looks like inside your DPC membership, and here’s what people with your issue typically need in terms of sessions.”
Basically give it the full discovery call feel so they understand where the free part ends and where your actual plan of care begins. That protects you and makes the whole thing way smoother.

Second option: if she’s planning to raise her prices, then your service can just be baked into that increase. It becomes a value add for her members and she stays whole financially. My guess is she’s probably not looking to raise prices, but it’s still worth mentioning because it’s the most straightforward version of the model.

Third option: she pays you directly per person she sends over. If you go this route, compare it to what you’d normally spend on acquiring a patient. If you’re running paid ads, depending on your city you might be paying anywhere from $80 to $150 just to get someone on a phone call. These aren’t cold traffic leads though. These are warm, already-sold referrals coming from someone they trust. That’s worth a lot. Your conversion rate on those will typically be double what you get from ads.

If you frame it that way, you can structure a win-win so every patient who needs PT goes straight to you as the default, not “one of several options.” She sells it as part of the experience. You take it from the first call onward.

So you’ve got a few models here. Just make sure whatever you choose sets expectations properly and positions you as the consistent PT solution for her people. That’s where this kind of relationship becomes genuinely fruitful instead of chaotic.

> **Response 2:** You have to be careful with these laws -the easiest way is to just accept referrals from the doc : 

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS): Prohibits knowingly offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (cash, gifts, discounts) to induce referrals for services paid by federal programs (Medicare/Medicaid).
Violations are felonies with severe penalties (prison, fines, exclusion from programs).
Stark Law (Physician Self-Referral Law): Prohibits physicians from referring patients for certain services (like lab work, PT, imaging) to entities they or their family have a financial relationship with (ownership or compensation), unless an exception applies.
State Laws: Many states (e.g., Texas) have independent anti-solicitation or anti-kickback laws that can be stricter.
Professional Ethics: The APA and other  organizations specify that payments should be for services rendered, not based on the referral.

**Original Post:**
Are there any mobile ortho PTs in the group that have successfully become a "preferred provider" for orthopedic surgery group(s) in their area?  I really feel like this is an important group for us to market to, but there's a delicate line because they often have preferred PTs in their community (clinic based) that they want to feed referrals to for one reason or another.  IMO, offering 1-2 weeks at home for early post-op would be a sweet spot, then refer them to the standard clinic (if the referrer and/or patient wants to) for the remainder of rehab...?  I am thinking of the smaller ortho procedures (knee 'scope, RC repair, ACLR,) which aren't likely to qualify for home health, but need early PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting idea. Would you do this as a cash based service for non-Medicare folks or through insurance?

> **Response 2:** I have a mobile PT solo practice, and about 70% of my patients are first 2 weeks post-op total knees. Then the docs send them out to whatever clinic they want. I really enjoy it!

Has anyone successfully transferred their Google Voice phone number over to a “real number”? Like if I wanted to get a complete separate phone for my business apart from my personal phone. Main priority is keeping the same number. My other thought is I could get a second phone and still use google voice on that phone with the same number. My problem is I can no longer tell which calls are coming through Google voice for my business versus for my personal number. It used to look different when a call came through but after I updated my phone awhile ago it looks the exact same. I want to be able to screen calls and answer appropriately

Hello! Looking to start my own practice within the next 5-6 months and have the option to rent a space at a local CrossFit gym. Curious what pros/cons you have experienced when having an office at a gym! I searched the group and didn’t find exactly what I was looking for. 

We discussed paying a lower monthly rent with an additional fee based on hourly gym equipment usage. Approximately 400 sq ft. 
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve built my entire business out of CrossFit gyms. Depends on the population you want to treat. My ideal client is a CrossFitter, so nobody has minded the music or noise. I’ve had a lot non-CrossFit clients go on to join the gym afterwards even. I just pay hourly with a cap. Use of equipment is included. I’ve never had an issue with CrossFit gyms not wanting their members to go to other gyms for rehab. I get sent people from most of the gyms in the area without any issue. They want their members healthy and back in class.

> **Response 2:** I know many people including myself that have started and grown very successful practices inside of CrossFit gyms. 

A sliding scale initially is a great idea if they are up to it. 

Basically assume the “full time” price and work backwards form there

If I was working here full time it would be this price then adjust for 30 hrs or 20 hrs or 10 hrs etc.

Question for mobile PT's that also successfully have their business listed on Google and it comes up in a search for "physical therapy near me"...

Hi, so I'm currently 100% mobile.  I had my business listed on Google successfully for a while but in order for it to come up in a search of "physical therapy near me" I had to include my home address, which I had just accepted and was fine with ( I also had gotten a few leads this way).  But I actually don't see clients in my home.  

Well recently, Google froze my listing saying it didn't comply with their standards...with no notification or warning.  😳🤬
I had to submit a request to reinstate, and they did finally end up reinstating (they also never told me how my listing didn't comply), but now it doesn't have my address listed and so I don't come up on a search (or on a map).  It did ask me if I saw clients at this address (so I'm assuming that's why it's not longer appearing).  Does anyone know if there is a workaround or remedy for this?  

I still don't entirely understand all aspects of SEO and all that is involved with this, but wondering what other mobile PT's have done.  Or if you have suggestions of someone to consult who might be able to help.  TIA!  

Picture so this post doesn't get lost...and well just because it was a great freakin' sunset on my drive home Monday.  And you gotta stop and appreciate those kinds of things.  😉

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't have any suggestions as I also struggle with this and anything SEO, but wanted to say your picture is incredible and thanks for the reminder to notice the small stuff 😊

> **Response 2:** Are you talking about your gmb or do you have a website? And how does Google know you legit work from that address or not? It just has to be a valid address....if you don't want your personal info out there, could you use the post office? Or are you saying since you don't work from the address Google cancels you?

Sorry for the semi-long post.  I have been a member of this group for a while, but just recently left my corporate health care job to join a small private practice (2 other clinicians with 2 locations).  In the system we had more patients than we could handle, now I'm struggling to find any.  I have 2 kids and as the bread winner in the family am feeling uncertain about my decision financially.  What tips do you all have for free marketing, reaching target audience, etc?  Limited budget for spending on these kinds of things.  I would appreciate and and all help you seasoned uncagers have to offer!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Erin!! I think it helps to “niche” down and market right to the people of how you can treat differently than in the hospital system! I’m happy to chat with you since I see you are now in Brookfield by me 🤗 congrats on the move!

> **Response 2:** Interview the referral sources in your own podcast and show. Show them how you can help them. Give give give. Serve serve serve. And then ask ask ask after. Or if you don't want to do that. Run FB ads. We are so busy that I turned it off. 

I started with interviewing them in our podcast and now do hybrid. 

Good luck!!!

I like to send a handwritten thank you card to each MD that sends me referrals, every time they send me a new patient. Would you name the patient in the note? or just a generic "Thank you for the referral". Is anyone else doing this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a physician, I would like a "Thanks for referring (patient name). She is progressing well and I plan to see her for another x weeks. She has a followup set up to see you after that. Please don't hesitate to call us you have any questions about her therapy."

As all healthcare providers, physicians are busy. I dont want to spend the time opening a card that just says thanks for the referral. What does help is someone saying you passed the ball, I've got it and I'm taking care of the patient. It also helps that it's noted the patient has a followup already and it's not asking the physician to look things up or set more things up. Hope that helps. If it's ok with HIPPA (I would think it is) it helps to include the name because there are certain patients that stick out to you and having that reassurance in a quick read is gold.

> **Response 2:** If possible, I’ll personally drop off the eval and offer an in-person thank you to any new MD referral sources, which removes any HIPPA issues. 
Also, I set up a weekly call in time w several of my main referral MDs, so I can give him/her a quick live update about their Pt’s. They appreciate getting live feedback, so they can ask questions etc. This is especially true for those MDs who offer concierge cash based services; as they want to really be on top of their pts and want their pts to know their getting full personal service and care. This way, they tell the pt “I spoke to your PT, he said you’re doing better etc”. Also, it helps me recapture lost/lazy pts, as the MD will call them to remind them to restart PT

> **Response 1:** I've seen a few videos from Michelle Cunningham called 5-minute video and I was thinking of taking a look at those as well. If anyone has used her information, I'd love to know!

> **Response 2:** I’m not an expert by any means but I’ve heard 2 pieces of advice frequently that I’ve found to be true:
1. The more you post, the easier it becomes so try to post often while you’re building the skill.
2. Don’t be a perfectionist, something is better than nothing.
Good luck! 🍀

**Original Post:**
I'm a physical therapist looking to connect with others who have partnered with gyms. I'm interested in learning more about how these relationships work, especially in regards to using gym equipment and bringing in non-member clients.

Questions:

How do you typically structure your partnership with the gym?
Are you allowed to bring in clients who are not members? If so, are there any restrictions or limitations?
Do you have to prioritize the gym's members over your own clients?
What are the benefits and challenges of partnering with a gym?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do not have a private practice but have been researching here and there for a few years. These are great questions, but unfortunately, the answer is not one-size-fits-all. In terms of amenities and business practices, things may differ between gyms, so it’s essential to know what you want for both your patients and your business.

Not allowing non-members would be a major red flag. Everything else can and should be negotiated.

If they want member priority, this could be harmful for growth, but you can counter with offering designated member-only times, discounted member rates, asking for lower rent, or requesting marketing support.

There is so much ambiguity in this aspect that it will be beneficial to know where you will excel and where you may struggle, so that you ensure the partnership is mutually beneficial and unlikely to lead to future tension.

Protect your brand and your values (this is your motivation and drive), ensure a contract is formed (with plenty of reflection and revision), have an exit strategy in writing, and build in a re-negotiation date at a certain checkpoint.

As for structure, the most common that you will see are flat rate rent, percentage of revenue, or a hybrid. If you expect very fast growth, then a flat rate may be optimal. If you expect slow growth, a percentage of revenue may be better. A hybrid offers them a guarantee while giving you protection if growth is slow.

You could offer a revenue cap where you pay a percentage of revenue up to a certain threshold, followed by a reduction in percentage — possibly even to zero. Another option is a tiered split, where the percentage decreases as your revenue increases.

> **Response 2:** Depends on your agreement/contract with gym. I like percent per visit (can be anywhere 10-30% depending on how everything is set up) rather than flat fee, this gives the gym incentive to send people your way.

Topic: SEOs / Google Search 

I just moved to a new state and launched my website, so I don’t get much visits (yet! 🤞), but I make sure every web page on the site has all the necessary keywords: biz name, our services, specialties, locations, contact info, and even my name. 

I can get my business’ name on the top of the first page on Google when people search it. The dilemma is when I search physical therapy + our city. The business doesn’t even show up in ANY of the pages (even as far back as page 5+). My area is pretty small and there’s no other provider within 25 mi from me, but the top hits are practices outside of my radius.

I’ve spoken to local businesses owners and none of them have paid for ads or search engine page boosts. I’m sure there’s a way then to be a top (non-sponsored) hit organically, that won’t take decades to achieve. 

So for those of you who have had success in this, how are you doing it? Any advice is appreciated! 🫶

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just like you expect someone to pay you for your expert services, pay someone that is an expert in SEO...it's worth the ROI

> **Response 2:** Is your Google Business profile updated? 

Did you update title tags and meta descriptions too? 

Jenny Gill is an OT and copywriter who is great with SEO. 

If there aren’t other providers in the area, I would t pay someone to keep changing your SEO. You should be able to rank. 

How long have you had the website listed in the new location? 

Is your business address still an old location in some other paperwork or something? Or maybe even in your privacy policy/terms & conditions page? 

Also, have you submitted your website to get re-crawled?

Hello, I received a referral from a Concierge MD to treat one of their patient for back pain. This is only the 3rd referral I have received from this MD. The pt was very nasty on the phone and stated she would not fill out any intake paperwork. Do I/Should I write to the referring MD and explain the situation and how this pt is not a good fit, or do I just let it go and not mention anything to the MD? 

In hindsight, this MD tends to send over very "high maintenance" people compared to other concierge MD I get referrals from.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would let the doctor know the patient declined services, or whatever happened and thank them for the referral.. so they don’t think you’re the problem and stop referring to you

> **Response 2:** Absolutely send a letter. 

The story the patient tells the doctor will be TOTALLY different and place you in a very magazine light I’m sure. 

People are weird 😉 
Our perceptions are wildly different from the same interaction.

Has anyone brought on a marketer/salesperson for their therapy company? I have a mobile conpany and looking to scale, I’ve pretty much maxed out my marketing potential so I’m looking at next steps. I tried an agency but they go through marketers on a monthly basis so nothing sticks. I’m considering bringing on someone to start as part time with potential growth (maybe some equity in the future too).

Any recommendations?

Thank you!

How are people reimbursing their hourly staff for time spent marketing and going out and meeting physicians?

I’m an OT and have interviews with a few PTs this week and marketing would be completely different than my referral sources.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My billing/office manager did this for me because she was a natural. We defined what a “contact” was and she was paid for each as well as receiving a bonus for each new referral received within a specific time period. She tracked all of it and I verified it. It was a win-win. If my therapists went out to do an event, a lunch and learn, shadowed a physician, etc, they were paid regular hourly rate or salaried as professionals should be….same for on-boarding. Edited to add that I constantly reminded my therapy and non-therapy staff that EVERY encounter with a patient, referral source or community member was an important “marketing” opportunity.

> **Response 2:** Admin rate. $17/hour for PTA’s and $25/hour for PT/OT

Google voice users:
I currently receive my personal and business numbers through my cell. I recently brought on  a receptionist and we are trying to figure out how to use her own phone to handle calls I can forward incoming calls to her, but she has to use my phone to make calls or view texts. Is there a way to use the same number through both phones without setting her up for an additional number?  Which would defeat the purpose. 
Ideally, we'd like to set up a phone dedicated to the clinic, but this is the current situation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just moved my phones to GoHighLevel.  
Can forward the phone to ring where you want, outgoing calls/texts all from the work line + the calls are time/date stamped & can be recorded for review.

> **Response 2:** You have to be in the same Google account as her.

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love what Fitzherbert Harry said 👌👍
Going off of that, BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS with people may serve you a gracious plenty.  

At the end of the day, it’s still far more valuable for your business to learn how to have conversations and develop relationships.  

SEO is great.  But don’t hide behind that.

> **Response 2:** Hi Amy, I use goDaddy. Did the website myself. I know it could use tweaking and to be easier to navigate but honestly, it’s really more my digital business card more than anything else. I don’t pay for SEO. Or haven’t yet anyway. Google my business is key. It’s free and getting reviews, responding to them and posting photos and things on there is key. I get calls all the time and they say “I googled and found you and your reviews are amazing” I wouldn’t spend money on the website SEO…. Too many  better places to spend IMO

**Original Post:**
**Want to know** **when I *REALLY* started loving what I do?**

I have always loved being a therapist.  I seriously don't think that there is anything else that I would do.

Yes, I experienced burnout and all of that other stuff that perhaps many of you have experienced, or are experiencing now.

When I started my own practice in 2013, I finally felt free.

But do you want to know what changed everything for me?

Want to know how I managed to get to where I am today?

Simple, really.

I did two things.

I started investing in myself with coaching.

I started attending LIVE events.  

Not your typical national association conferences.  But true LIVE events- the kind where everyone there was hungry for something different.

Everyone there knew that the status quo just wasn't going to cut it; nor was it going to take them to where they wanted to go.

The energy and momentum that came from those events were immense.

But that's not all that I got from these LIVE events.

Perhaps the greatest gift and value that I received - which skyrocketed me - was the COMMUNITY that was created at each event.

Better yet, it was the FAMILY that bonded us all.

Many stressors that I had suddenly went away, because I had found a family that had my back.  

One with whom we shared ideas - none of which were bad ideas. 

We supported each other.  We encouraged each other.  

Everyone inspired by everyone else.

It was from the same coaching program and LIVE events where I was blessed to have crossed paths with Josh Payne and Kevin DeGroot, both who are now my business partners.

I would venture to say that each of them would credit the investments that they made - and that we have made together - as keys to their successes.

And now, we want nothing more than for YOU to join us in experiencing *community*.

*And to find your family.*

We invite you to commune with us this **Oct 6-9 in Denver, CO**. for the 2nd annual UNCAGEDLIVE22

This event is for PT's, OT's, respective assistants, Chiros, SLP's, LMT's, and more.

To learn more about **UNCAGEDLIVE**, click on the link in the comments below!

We already have more than 100 family members attending!  We want you to come with us!

(Oh, and in case you're wondering.  We have coaching programs for the new and existing practice owners.  We would love to talk to you about them!)

And …. Let’s hear what this means to you in relation to the “evolution” of PT over the last …50 years…. And GO!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That we (therapists) are no longer the ones who decide what a patient’s potential is and facilitate the realization of that potential. We now often give them treatment to address where they are and pass them to a different level of care. The result is that many patients don’t reach their full recovery potential. Bad for them. Bad for us.

> **Response 2:** Every new grad (and especially seasoned PTs who know better) who works for a “PT Mill” with unrealistic productivity demands is making it harder for all of us to push back against exploitation and protect the integrity of our profession.

Until we come together as a majority to refuse unreasonable conditions, nothing will change.

I left in network care years ago but it took years of building credibility and experience (and feeling the burnout) in network to make the leap.

What is the easiest way to create an Amazon link that lists all of the products I recommend to patients, just to streamline things?  

Right now I look up whatever they need and send them the Amazon link during the visit.  Because I also do personal training I am recommending more and more equipment, and sometimes might recommend multiple items, since most of these clients work out at home. 

I am looking into the Amazon Associate program, but thought that they changed their rules a while back allowing you to send the link out via text and email, and not just from your website? 

Otherwise I'll just make a Google doc with links to all of the items and call it a day. 

Always striving to be more efficient so if you have any knowledge on this I would appreciate it, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just got setup as amazon associate and using link tree, pretty painless! Associate, affiliate, and influencer are all different things so that was the hardest part of getting setup was figuring out what to go with or what i was approved for

> **Response 2:** Generally, you can create a wish list and add products to it to keep them all organized in one spot. But if you want to earn commissions on the items, apply for the affiliate program and then you would create an “idea list” and add products to that and put a link to that list on your FB/insta business pages or website and you could direct people to those places to click the link to your recommended products. You can share your affiliate link on each individual item with clients but there was a rule that you couldn’t send the affiliate link directly through text. It might have changed to allow that now, not sure. The client had to go to your business page and go through the link from there.
You have to disclose that you earn commissions as an affiliate. You can check mine out on my business FB if you want. Stretch PT and Wellness ATL

So... you play the marketing game to a select few local MDs, discuss things with the MA/front desk, have a good face to face with the doc, hear "yeah, this is great, we'll refer some your way," then you NEVER HEAR ANYTHING.

I know it's all about building relationships, but what specifically is the next step? Try to hit the front desk again? Show up unexpectedly and drop off more pens? Let it go and bug another clinic?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t have great luck with marketing to physicians. For me, joining networking groups and building relationships is where I’ve found success!

> **Response 2:** Bear with me…. I’m I’m totally serious: are you taking good donuts?

The return on investment of donuts is pretty incredible. 

Look, they’ve got pens. And-post its.

They want / appreciate good quality donuts (Not Dunkin, never Dunkin).

Personal experience?  A dozen donuts gets you a referral.

But when you are there, are you spending most of your time talking about the business? Or are you shooting the shit with them (sorry: I didn’t have another phrase): talking about their kids? Last nights ballgame? Going huntin’? Everyday conversation
To get to know them? 

They don’t care about that last course you went to or if you do this new thing with backs. It’s about building relationships. And getting to know THEM (doc, nurse, front desk…do not ignore AT All the front desk.) . Front desk is the key.

Who is attending CSM in San Diego?
We are sponsoring a house on Coronado Island for our current therapists. 
It’s a good opportunity to expand our network, so I am hoping to meet up with new therapists interested in working within our proven model. 
Please use the link, if you’re interested in an informal “meet and greet” at the “CPT beach house”.  
FYI- we are very selective in our approach to new relationships or partnerships.



**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What a neat business model you have going here! 

It seems like a bridge between the standard employee setup and flying totally solo starting your business. Is that right Bryan Williams? 

I love seeing all the different models and outside the box thinking that clinicians are doing! 💪🏼 🤩

> **Response 2:** I’m not able to attend the meet and greet but I’m curious about your offer. Are the sessions with the patient to be done in person or virtual?

my non-compete is fairly vague, stating that I can’t solicit business from current or former clients. 
if I leave my job to start my own practice and my clients ask why I’m leaving, if I simply state I’m starting my own thing is that considered soliciting business?
what about general marketing in my city towards clientele my current job serves?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Telling clients you are leaving because you’re starting your own business is not asking them to follow you. It’s a simple statement of fact.

Just curious! Does anyone sell peptides in their business? I have the opportunity from a supplier on selling them. Also, any legal issues from selling peptides? 
I am located in TN.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The only peptide I would want to sell is BPC-157 and that’s not FDA approved in injectable format

> **Response 2:** I don’t sell peptides but I offer my clients a free health assessment that can guide them to the correct supplements for their needs. I don’t stock supplements. I do carry a line of wellness products that I resell - Rowe Casa. I would say consider your referral sources. If a PT clients has a negative experience with the peptides and tells their referral source that they got their injectable peptides (assuming that’s what you’re referring too) from their PT provider, how would that affect a referral relationship especially if it’s a medically licensed referral partner? The peptide game is crazy right now! Also check your state practice act…

Rental space dilemma: 

After one person commented that being in the CrossFit gym could quickly stifle my growth I decided to see what else was out there. So I stumbled onto a 1000 sq ft commercial office space with pretty easy access to the freeway. This space would offer me two 11.5 ft x 7.5 f (90 sq ft) treatment rooms, access to a shared kitchenette room, and a main room with private entrance to it that is 20 ft x 40 ft (800 square ft). The price for this listing would be $1000 which includes all utilities, WiFi which they said they would have a WiFi hub added to my end of the building, and no CAM fees. The place is also only 15-20 minutes from the house plus a good fairly central location in Utah County. Oh it would also be a 1 min drive to another one of RxFit’s CrossFit gym which is the gym I’m a member of. 

I would be sharing the building with a Real estate company whom is the owner of the building. He seemed really interested in getting me into the space and talked about having a couple other offers, most likely a sales tactic, but said he didn’t want them and thought I would be a good fit for the place. Once again probably a sales tactic, but he definitely seemed interested like they would modify whatever I needed to help make the space more suitable. 

So weighing in this space against the CrossFit gym space I feel like I would be an absolute idiot to not seriously consider it as an option. 

Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Prior to becoming a PT, an old Crossfit gym of mine had a PT and massage therapist rent a space inside. All I could ever think of was how it would be difficult to communicate with clients (or to relax when getting a massage) with music always cranked up and blasting really loud during your business hours and having no control over that.

> **Response 2:** What is your 3 or 5 year plan? We can fill 2,000 sq ft really easily with 2 clinicians. I have owned and relocated over 10-clinics and my first was 800 sq ft, but 2K sq ft is about the best size for us.

What advice would you give to a therapist who wants to be uncaged?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Answer three questions: WHY and WHY and WHAT.... Why do you want to be UNCAGED for yourself? What is in it for you and your family (or future family).  WHY does YOUR practice have to exist in the community?  WHAT is it that you do for people. Then..... BELIEVE in yourself. Understand what your PASSION is. Display ACTIVE PATIENCE.  Maintain your GRIT.  Finally, truly, save yourself time, money (in the long run), and a world of frustration by having a guide/mentor/coach who has done it to lead you.

> **Response 2:** Hire a business coach.  They help rocket your business forward faster and with less guesswork.  They have several proven processes because they've been there and have already helped others.
You're going to make your own mistakes no matter what, but you can avoid the ones they've already made. They know how to coach past them. 
David Bayliff , who runs this page has an incredible program. Free knowledge is great, but it only takes you so far.
You need to invest in your knowledge by hiring a coach. 
I am in my 3rd practice. A formal coaching group was the best investment I ever made.

Hi everyone
I’m checking UHC insurance benefits and I always get confused when it says no referral required and no visit limits. Does it mean I can see patient without a doctor’s referral , no signed POC and however long the patient needs? Insurance also says do not charge $35 co-pay. She’s a neuro patient . Please advise, I am not trying to beat the system, I just need guidance because I’m new to this. Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Typically then you'd follow your state practice act. Always follow the strictest rule

> **Response 2:** Q: Checking insurance benefits and I always get confused when it says no referral required, and no visit limits. 
Can I see the patient without a doctor’s referral, no signed POC and however long the patient needs? 

No referral means it's not an HMO plan that would need a referral. 
Check your state direct access laws, we have 20 days or 10 visits whichever is sooner without a script, and a script from a doctor is needed to have the insurance pick it up. And also charts need a doctor's signed POC/eval and re-evals.
You have to be able to show progress, and it be a skilled therapy needed and not maintenance care. Otherwise if there's a plateau (after one re-eval already having a flare up) they may try their HEP on their own a bit, because insurance may reject payment and the bill may fall to the patient.
Also unlimited visits may also have a money cap if it's Medicare, which is about 30 visits before the chart would be audited and modifiers need to be added each time. 
Was told some neuro can be tough because can be auto immune dx e.g. M.S. where it does not always steadily improve. But working in Ortho, I don't have all the insurance and outs.

Seeking a sports med PT in Charlotte, NC area to consult with a very active college student/military recruit with hip pain/prior femoral stress reaction who is home for Christmas break. He was already screened by ortho MD on campus and advised to stretch hip flexors and rest over break but he's seeking a more specific management plan for MSK pain. 

His mom is a friend from high school and she reached out to me for advice but I'm 5 hours away and am trying to find someone local to them to refer to for in person screening. Thanks.

> **Response 1:** I’m in South Park area of Charlotte. I’ll be gone tomorrow until 12/26. I have a softwavetrt that can give him a jump start on his healing. My flight isn’t until tomorrow afternoon if they’d like to call in the morning. I can be reached on my personal cell phone in the morning at 704-840-2361.

EDIT: He admitted it was a miscommunication on his part. I told him I understand. He can keep them since like someone what mentioned, they would follow him anyways since I have no availability. Plus he's built a great relationship with them and I want them to continue to be successful. 

I appreciate everyone's quick input.

Advice please! I have an independent contractor who I've known since he was an intern at a clinic we both worked at. When he decided he wanted to leave there, I brought him on to my business. He then wanted to start his own (I fully supported it).
We had a conversation the other week that he was getting really fully with his business and wouldn't be able to see my clients anymore. No problem. But I did say, you have to see SO and SO bc I can't fit them into my schedule. He just gave me his last time sheet and said thank you so much for blah blah. I asked oh you're not seeing SO anymore. He said, oh I am but through my (his) business since you said you have no room for them. 
Ummm... that's not what I meant. 
What do I do, if anything? It is 2 clients (brothers).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What? Wow? That is awful

> **Response 2:** I would shake it off and let it go. Maintain a good relationship with him. There may be a day he is too busy to take patients and will refer to you, but not if this gets blown up. 
Most likely these patients will follow him anyway if he was the one treating them.

Have you ever ended a relationship with a referral source because they were difficult? I have one that is rude, texts at all hours of the night, any day of the week, and tries to micromanage me. They do not refer very often so the stress doesn't really seem worth it to me.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a friend of a friend who was a PA who thought they could tell me how to run my business, esp when it came to their friends who needed PT. So yes, we cut ties.

Those who are solo therapists, how do you handle vacations? Are your patients ok taking a week off when you are on vacation? Have you felt people quit or got unmotivated when you paused services?
I am from Brazil, and between  going home and a specialization I am taking, I take about 4 weeks off a year. 
I am technically ready to uncage. I have full 17 sessions a week and a 3 week waiting list, and I currently stopped taking new patients for the rest of the year because I can’t even fit the people I have… but I am held back by fear…. Mostly silly I am the one supporting a family of 6….
What if I go on vacation and my caseload quit on me? (Hasn’t happened and I’ve taken tons of time this year… but I did not really care or apologize because it was not my main income… people were still here when I come back… but I worry that when I need them to stay they may go?)
What if something happens and as a LLC I don’t have disability insurance?
What if once I go full time all the patients disappear?
What if another covid like event happens and I have no patients??? 

It is so scary… right now I plan on holding until end of April because I go to Brazil for spring break, and have 1 1-week class in February…. So I figured i could use my work PTO and sabe some money for emergencies in between…. But I AM technically ready… so sometimes I feel like I should just do it because there will always be a reason to wait a bit more…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Network with a few PTs around that you can refer to when you’re out.  
Most of my clients prefer to wait for me, but appreciate the options — especially for acute flare ups.

> **Response 2:** One of the biggest things I've noticed since becoming uncaged is my patients are so supportive of me taking time off and doing things for myself.... No guilt trips or rude comments like I'd always get from coworkers and patients in the corporate setting. I have just tried to do more trips starting midweek so that I can squeeze patients in before and after I go, and flights are usually cheaper that way too!

Tactics come and go which is why Uncaged tries so hard to be focused predominantly on principles. 

Yes we teach tactics as well but we want to help instill in our clients the skills to adapt with an ever changing market.

We are not an agency that does things for you because that creates dependency on the agency. We’re mentors and coaches who help you develop yourself as a business owner and entrepreneur. 

Tactics can cause you to have a quick win or two but principles create staying power

Thoughts on doing my marketing on the social media of a gym I am going to be renting from? 🤔💪👍
The owner offered to add my name and services on their website at no charge. Any pros and cons? 🤩💰🤝
I can only think of that people may perceive me as an employee not a independent clinician. 🧑‍💼🤔🤷

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Will you be only posting on their social media or can you mark it as a collaboration? 

My only issue is if you only post on their social media, you are not growing your brand if you move locations. It would be better to collaborate so you both will gain followers and access their followers and if you ever leave, the followers that like your content will still be with you. Hopefully that makes sense

> **Response 2:** I’m not sure what the cons if any are? Somebody willing to put your name, face, and company on their website, for free, in front of their clientele, who they have already established the know-like-trust factor, further vouching for you as a reputable service provider? Seems like a win to me.

Looking for advice on HIPAA compliant messaging apps. We are a mobile practice with 18 employees and we need to be able to communicate between PT,OT, ST and admins involved in patient cases while on the road and at the patient’s homes. Any suggestions??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We are almost the same (17 staff mobile !) and we use Google Suite as our set up with a BAA and Google voice as our phone system..paubox to encrypt our email… we primarily use the Google chat and rooms feature day to day for internal communication and it works great for our purposes

Hey there,
If allowed, I’d like to understand more about OTs in private practice. 

I am a PT in private practice and over the past year I’ve been able to get a pretty steady case load of clients.  (Mostly all Medicare) I’d like to bring on an OT so that my clinic would better serve the population that I personally like to treat (more neuro/less orthopedic). 

I have thought about two options of 
1) hiring an OT (not sure I can afford) 
2) inviting an OT to build their own business and basically just rent space from me - I have a whole private room available and all equipment available and could add them to my current EMR, etc.  in my mind this is an extremely turnkey option for an OT to get “uncaged”. (I win because having both disciplines seems more marketable and also from receiving rent) 

However the only OT I’ve actually talked to about this was just so negative about the idea that OTs could build a caseload and how much easier it is for PTs.  

Can any uncaged OTs comment on if you were able to build a business as OT in a brick and mortar space? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s too bad they were negative about a great opportunity.  Some things to consider: Have you been collecting data on how many of your patients would benefit from OT?  Or how many calls and referrals you’ve have for OT and had to turn away?  What are the other OT clinics doing in the area?  WHO are their clients?

> **Response 2:** I’m an OT who’s owned an OON clinic for 4 years and have a PT & OT on my staff. I honestly have realized that clients don’t care what the letters are behind the name of the person treating them, as long as they can get the help they need and they connect well with the providers. I do think PT has done much better in the marketing sector in what PTs actually do (even in acute care environments, so many assume we’re PTs), but overall, it’s not more difficult from a business standpoint!

Hey everyone!  3 questions

I am starting my own ortho/sport practice and partnering with a small gym/training center that tailors to golfers. I will be working more into that community but, I'd like to bring in outside sources too because it's fun to switch up what you treat 🙂

-Starting out, what were your most productive forms of generating leads?

-For those who did tabling events/ortho screens what marketing materials and pt equipment did you bring to your setup? 

-For reaching out to MDs for referrals, what have you found is the best approach? 

Thank you all for any advice! Its a scary but fun time starting out

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just remember when you’re starting out the easiest way to generate leads is doing a great job with each client and “word of mouth” spreads! With each proof of concept client in the early part of your practice, your confidence grows and so do your referrals. 😉 

I’m 7 years in and still haven’t looked back. It’s hard work, but very rewarding.

> **Response 2:** Hi Lindsey– Congrats on starting! We started a running-focussed practice in the past.

What worked pretty well is becoming part of several niche athletic communities, schools and providing value there sporadically (advice, prevention, etc)– For example offer free injury screens at events or training sessions. 

And also listing on Google maps with a physical location! That's where people look for  when they are looking for a PT. They Google 'Physical Therapy in XYZ', or 'PT Near Me'.

Hey everyone!
I’ve done mobile pelvic floor therapy as well as leased space as needed from a chiro office over the last 3 years. I’m ready to have my own space, especially as I can only see clients when the chiropractors are not in the office which is very limiting. 

After looking for the last couple of months (while turning away clients who wanted office visits when their schedules didn’t match my availability there), I have found a great option in my budget ($900 for 550 sq ft with waiting room, gym area and private treatment room, and bathroom, lease 2 yrs). This location is 5 min from my house which is amazing bc I have a 4mo old and 2 y/o.

The only catch: the space is on the second floor, no elevator. I’m currently only in network with BCBS, the rest of clients are cash pay. I was considering going in network with Medicare down the road but this would make that very challenging in the next 2 years in this space. I do home visits for newly postpartum moms. With my current population I don’t think this will be an issue, aside from moms who can’t bring their stroller in. I can always offer a home visit for anyone who is mobility impaired or postop, etc. I also don’t mind helping people carry anything up the stairs if needed.

Thoughts?? Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Second floor space with out an elevator would be a deal breaker for me. My first office space was on the second floor but it did have an elevator. I actually had a few that were fearful of the wk are and requested to take the stairs.  I decided with my second space I absolutely wanted to be on the main floor and I’ve had so many people remark about how much better they like it.

> **Response 2:** Oof that’s tough because it seems perfect in every other way! This was a dealbreaker for me because I didn’t want moms to have to worry about carrying car seats or strollers up the stairs (I’m also pelvic).

I work in a private practice that accepts insurance and also have my own cash business that is out of network. 

My question is am I legally able to provide super bills to my clients through my buisness since I am technically “in network” with insurance companies through the private practice

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can if you have a different LLC at different location

> **Response 2:** I don’t think so. I believe you still need the Npi of the treating clinician, which in your case is in network. So they would probably process it as in network or it might get denied

What can I legally/ethically offer to incentivize my neighbors to use my mobile therapy services? I figure I can cut down my in between client time significantly if they're in my zip code.  I know offering a discount is frowned upon, but legally/ethically speaking can I? Do you have other ideas of how to incentivize?  I took my first client out of my desired range because I was excited and it took me 40+ minutes each way. This is just not practical long term.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It's really the same thing. You can either charge a travel fee for far away clients or provide a discount for nearby clients.  As you get further into this though I would definitely try to shrink your area as much as possible. Word of mouth is huge and that's usually what gets me a lot of clients in my area

> **Response 2:** Why is a discount frowned upon? If they are cash then you dictate the price. Unless they are federal payer. - different rules. Everyone starts somewhere. You incentive with everything that sets you apart from others. I have neighbors post about me in the Facebook page. Word spreads fast.

I'm winging it here and at a point where I don't really know what to do next. 
My dream job fell into my lap in May when my husband and I decided to move to Las Vegas. I was in a comfy hospital OP ortho job in Alaska, loved my coworkers, my patients, the structure, everything. He retired and we needed more for our family, so I left that behind. I met an ATC in Vegas who owns a beautiful gym in a very affluent area, and was looking to add a PT to his space. I always felt like being a cash based therapist in a gym setting was my ideal setting, but also wanted a few more years of practice under my belt first, since I just graduated in 2023. 

It felt very meant to be though to do this now, so over the last few months, I have been getting all licensing done, and building my business. 
Finally, I'm ready to start seeing patients. I've got word of mouth and several leads from the gym owner, I've set up a Facebook page and am posting in local groups, and I paid for Facebook ads. Messages I'm getting though are from people in Boston, Michigan... I'm not sure why, and I can't figure out how to target my ads better. I've also gotten a message from a Physician trying to get me to work at his local clinic one day a week to take insurance. 

Marketing is not my thing at all. I've tried and failed in the past. I can't give up now, I've invested a lot of money into this endeavor, but I just don't know where to go from here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Came here to say, having some support will definitely help address some of those doubts, and would recommend the Uncaged Team! 

Good luck!

> **Response 2:** Highly recommend business coaching. If you don’t know how to market or about business (majority of us) learning those skills are key to success. I started 8 months into my business and it was game changer wish I would have started earlier

Wondering if anyone has started their business as a side hustle while also working for a company in a smiliar setting and what your experience was. I am currently at a large corporation working in an outpatient setting. I am also up for a promotion to manager at this clinic. I am currently renting space at my CrossFit gym to do the occasional cupping/scraping sessions for members, but have always had dreams to turn it into an LLC structure and market out to the community for full cash based performance Physical Therapy. I really don’t want to step on any toes as I live in a very small town and would hate for my name to be ruined here. My outpatient setting is part of a hospital system so we see probably 75-80% Medicare/geriatrics and my ideal clients are the younger, active population. Would this be completely frowned upon or should I just go for it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I rented space out of a CrossFit gym for almost 3yr and started a LLC while working as an OP PT. I was upfront with my boss when I took the position. Now I have just recently transitioned full time to a brick and mortar location. It was a great, low risk opportunity to build a clientele up and get my feet wet!

> **Response 2:** Just check if your hospital system makes you sign a conflict of interest form or something. I just had to fill one out but nothing came of it and they might just tell you not to poach clients directly. But if you haven’t signed a non compete then you should be fine. I think being transparent to your bosses isn’t a bad idea so it doesn’t come across the wrong way, or if somehow a coworker found out and then told your bosses behind your back before you got the chance. I had a coworker try and get me trouble actually.

Hi everyone,

So I know we can't offer financial incentives for referrals due to kickback laws. 

I know some people who "get around" this by donating to charity. ie. "I can't offer direct financial compensation for referrals but I'd be happy to donate $50 to a charity of your choice for each referral"
 
What're people's thoughts? Genius or straight up illegal?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Straight curious: If you're outside insurance (and especially CMS stuff) do the anti-kickbacks even apply? Those are federal regs for federal programs, right? I've never seen a state practice act address anything like this.

> **Response 2:** Eric Schneider David Bayliff

Hey I understand the sentiment guys and the value of building relationships. But I don't see why you couldn't employ both if it is legal? They aren't mutually exclusive tactics. 

For example, massage therapists offer referral discounts all the time, since they aren't subject to healthcare kickbacks. They see a client for X number of sessions. After they've built trust with the client they ask them to recommend their services to people they know and say "I offer a $20 gift voucher for any referrals that come in" This happens in gyms and other wellness businesses too. 

It happens even more often in non health/wellness businesses. Does that mean building relationships isn't important in their industries just because they use financial incentives? I would argue no. 

Regardless, I just thought it was an interesting idea. I'm not going to employ it as of yet but I don't want to completely discredit it either. I definitely don't want to if it isn't legal. Can anyone comment on legality?

I received a referral for a patient who is deaf. A live interpreter is $60/hr with a 2 hour minimum.  What does everyone use if not a live interpreter? I think I will only need it for the initial visit as the patient is able to lip read well and I know a bit of ASL.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m deaf and lip read.  Did the patient request an interpreter?  I only ask because people often assume I need an ASL interpreter when all I really need is to be able to read your lips.  If you wear masks make sure you have clear masks.  If you need the FDA type 2 masks I can give you links where to purchase for your clinic. There’s many ways to get an interpreter if that’s what they request. If you use live dictation stay away from dragon.  Otter app is not HIPPA compliant unless on a work only device.  Live transcribe or Google meets has amazing transcriptions. Zoom is terrible

Hi everyone, as a mountain bike coach now, (quit the PT corporate world 3 years ago!) I'm starting to prep for some down-time during the winter season.  A couple years ago I got some online fitness programs up on the Everfit app, but I'm having trouble with selling these.  My coaching business does very well, as I run a very large women's mountain bike club here in Denver, and get a lot of clients from the club and now word-of-mouth.  Trying to figure out how to now tap into the fitness market.  There's just so much out there to compete with, not sure what to do next to make my members and other athletes, more aware of the great programs I can offer!   Thanks!

For those in the starting phases of building mobile outpatients, do you share your personal phone number with clients?

I’m hesitant to make my cell phone visible to the world, but also heard mixed reviews from Google Voice

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have been using the free version of google voice for five years without any issues. That being said I work in a fairly populated area. Not sure if that is what makes the difference

> **Response 2:** I use google voice. No issues here.

Any good certifications that are geared more towards personal trainers for pelvic health specifically, to help them improve their knowledge base on this population and more effectively work with clients?  

I'm aware of the Sarah Duvall PCES course but was wondering what other ones are geared toward increasing personal trainer knowledge. 

I'm also in a personal training networking group so this question came up recently.

Hi !!! Im new to uncaged.. but it's been so helpful reading all the comments and questions on different topics!!!
Im in a process of opening an outpatient ortho clinic. Not tech savvy and was wondering if WIX for website is a good option to start out with? I am considering  their business unlimited plan which supposedly does SEO optimizations as well. I personally think I would get more patients from MD referrals and word of mouth but these days a functioning  website is a must...don't want to spend tons of $$$ just yet
Any response is appreciated. Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been told Squarespace is better for SEO! I’m not an SEO expert so I don’t know for sure but I’ve been happy with Squarespace.

> **Response 2:** I've done SEO for years and I'd go with squarespace over wix. Honestly for SEO they are both roughly the same and ok. Wix has a lot more flexibility, but with that comes more headaches if you are a beginner. Squarespace is much more straightforward (but less customizable) and it's def better if you want to have a blog.

This will be a podcast-style LIVE ***right here in the FB group*** to celebrate our 300th UNCAGED CLINICIAN Podcast episode!! 

***Post your question here below in advance!!***

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You spell it out with the words ailment vs wellness. It's uncanny how many "ailments" clear up when you simply work on the "wellness" areas of strength and mobility.

> **Response 2:** I’m a new grad PT in MN where PTs cannot treat “human ailments” direct access until at least 1 year of licensure, OR 1) I obtain referral from a physician 2) I collaborate with a PT thats been licensed >1 year.

I have an amazing opportunity to provide both physical therapy and wellness services at a local fitness studio on a cash basis. My plan is to request all clients to provide a referral by their first visit if they’re seeing me for physical therapy evaluation, but I also want to provide a la carte wellness services (taping, cupping, injury screenings) for clients after workouts without needing a referral. 

My question is the following: “Where do I draw the line between what’s skilled physical therapy and what’s wellness?”

I won’t be a year licensed until November. I want my services to accessible, but I also don’t want the board to come for my throat 😓

Hey, Texas PT’s…how are you handling the transition for direct access without referral from 10 days to 30 days starting on 9/1.  I started with a patient this morning…ten days goes beyond 9/1.  Are y’all obtaining a referral for these patients within the ten days or just going with 30 since it bleeds together during this transition time?  Thanks!

Having a hard time finding therapists to do per diem work. Any ideas on how to advertise besides Indeed and those kind of sites?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Get a licensure list from your state. You can then pair it down to the appropriate zip codes. Sometimes those lists have phones and email, sometimes just emails, depends on the state and you can reach out with a text or email and may get a response. 

Others have some good suggestions. On indeed you can (it may be a paid option you need) message people with resumes to apply to your job. 

Therapists need active recruiting to fill a position. Just posting a job and waiting for applicants is never enough unfortunately.

> **Response 2:** I always found my per diem jobs through the therapy-grapevine . 

If I were you, I’d network with therapists and have them ask their friends who may not be practicing full time or at all. 

I was basically under cover and wouldn’t have responded to any job postings because then the head hunters come after you. 😱 

I was also wary of anyone advertising because I assumed they were desperate and wouldn’t try to demolish my boundaries. (Others may not have this issue, but a few employers burned me so I was highly skeptical and wary.)

When you were first starting off did you buy coffee or lunch for the providers you were soliciting? I've been marketing in varying ways for the past year and haven't broken through the heavily saturated field in my town. It feels sleazy but seems like if I were to add in a coffee order it might help get my name to stick. But then again, as a new practice it seems unwise to throw down a $75 coffee order for every doc I go to. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would look more towards something termed “shock and awe marketing”. Something that is big and overwhelmed them. It has to be something that’s allowed enough to break through the noise. If you show up like everyone else, the doctor will treat you like everyone else.

**Edit: thanks all for your responses. He has yet to send me any info via fax so don’t know if it is some sort of scam, he is really slow to send it, or what, but sounds like the majority wins and I will decline the client if I do get a referral. Any good ways to tell him other than I do not take personal injury clients in case I do get a referral?**
I was contacted by a texas personal injury medical center to see a client. I am a mobile business and do not accept insurance. The dr on the phone, said he was not the provider, his associate is, but that they would pay cash for all 10 visits up front and that even though this is personal injury, not to worry I would not be subpoenaed. He is faxing patient info. It sounds a little fishy and I wanted to know y’all’s experience and thoughts with this type of situation please.

Vestibular therapists - where do you get your referrals from besides from ENTs?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Think about who all else serves that client.  Beyond that, ANYONE can refer a vestibular client to you because virtually everyone knows someone at some point dealing with such an issue.  Bottom line, let people know who you help and the problems you solve for them.  You never know where that referral might come from.

> **Response 2:** We have an audiologist friend who was asking about vestibular PTs in the area the other day…they’d be a great market area!

I had a ton of gymnasts on my caseload when I used to work in CO, but I haven't had much luck breaking into that community since moving to NC. Thanks!

Google Voice question - 
Are you able to receive text messages?  I am able to send... but when people attempt to text back they are getting a message about being unable to text a land line.... I tried the "help" at Google Voice, it was no help!
Considering just adding a line with my mobile carrier to allow for texting if it won't work with Google Voice

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am using google voice for my Business. It is an additional app on your phone and yes you can text back and forth with patients. There might be some glitch why pts can't text you.

> **Response 2:** I have a Google voice number as my regular phone number and I added a Google voice number under a HIPAA compliant business line with a BAA. I can send and receive text messages respectively.

I’m having some trouble increasing my private client caseload. Im only looking for 1-2 more clients right now as I’m still working full time to get my ECS so I still need to have time for that. I’ve had a few people interested but they havnt responded to my follow up email/text (after we initially spoke). Any ideas on trying to reach out again without being annoying or seeming desperate? Or other avenues to find new clients? Any help is appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s (our own) perception that (we) are being annoying or desperate.

There are many reasons why people don’t return messages.  A simple “Fred, good day! I trust all is well.  
During our earlier conversation you indicated that your back was keeping you from _______.  
I’ve been thinking about your situation and some ideas came to mind. 
I wanted to follow back with you. Is the back pain still an issue for you?

> **Response 2:** Offer them something free of value.  "It import to me/us that everyone recover even those who are struggling and not currently our patient.  He is a link to download our _____." Do data collection on them and then follow up.  "How were the exercises, did it help, are you back to ____". You want to build their trust before you try to close.  Give them a quick win.

￼￼￼￼so I have a weird scenario…￼well, ￼￼I think it’s weird. I’m asking for guidance as I’m not sure what to do here. I was contacted by a local PT who, ￼like me, is also a cash based practice, also offers mobile, also works at a cross fit gym. In fact we offer many of the same services except I’m well known by many local runners and she seems to do a lot of pelvic floor/post partum. She reached out to me (through a friend) to work/collaborate/hire (see screen shot). Currently I commit 15 hours at my own company where I sublease out of a CrossFit gym. It keeps me relatively busy. But the rest of my work week is 24 hours at a outpatient clinic. Is this weird? Am I overthinking it? WOuld it be awkward to do the same work for another cash-based OON PT when I have my own company? 🤷🏻‍♀️ thanks for any advice

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You may want to remove her name from the screen shot. Just for privacy. 
As for the topic, it doesn’t cost anything to have a conversation. It may be a good opportunity.

> **Response 2:** I work for a cash practice on one side of town and run my own LLC out of my home and with mobile visits on the other. My boss has absolutely no problem with it and if anything has encouraged and help me! It’s been great to have someone to continue to learn from and bounce ideas off of for challenging clients. I was just very up front about continuing to see my own clients on my own time, and I’ve been given the respect and space to split my weeks between the two. I love my situation, as I left a large outpatient clinic prior to joining my current clinic. My life is significantly less stressful, I work fewer hours, I’m making just as much as I was before, and I’m seeing patients that actually want to get better. It’s a win/win to me.

I think we’ll start with just Vimeo & a Facebook group, but I’d eventually like to move to a platform that self automates with subscriber so I don’t have to constantly audit who has canceled, etc. I’m currently in a coaching mentorship group that uses the circle app, and I’ve enjoyed its interface as a member. Thanks!

For those of you who have a brick and mortar, how do you play music? Did you purchase a separate Spotify/Apple/etc account to play all day? I'm currently streaming music off my personal phone but wanted an option for my staff to use when I'm not there 😋

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** One person office here, stream from the Echo (Amazon music) and ask patients what artist/genre they like vs no music or radio or podcast.

> **Response 2:** A separate business Spotify account. It runs through our Roku TV speakers that we use￼ in our gym.  We did have Alexa last Here, but with Spotify we were able to make a bunch of different playlists based on what the different age groups like who come to us, and then also use it for some of our group classes.

I have created a policy for my clinic that, when a law firm reaches out for client records, I contact the client, and then email them the records, telling them they are welcome to forward/share as they see appropriate.  
I tell the law firm (without confirming who is and isn't a client) that all clients have access to their records and can share with them if they would like to.  

(all of our clients do have access to their records anytime via the online portal, but I send them all in 1 PDF for ease and as a courtesy.)

I just had a large law firm tell me that this is unheard of and be very frusterated during the hour that it took for the client to forward them their records.

Am I missing something?  Does anyone else just provide the records directly to clients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Usually the records come with something signed by the patient allowing them to request them and for you to send. However- I invoice the law firm and will not send until they pay us for them.

> **Response 2:** ￼You are the custodian of those records, legally. Simply sending a copy of records to a patient does not relinquish your custodial responsibility of protected health information.

If a third-party ￼entity has a record request with a signed patient consent form we have a legal requirement to send those records, but like some have referenced already, in certain situations we can invoice and withhold record delivery until that invoice is paid. ￼ this tends to vary depending on area jurisdiction. ￼

A clinic policy like you have described does not supersede or replace ￼custodial responsibility. There is a very specific process you have to go through to transfer that custodial responsibility. ￼

We have a lot of patients that just want us to continue to do manual with them after they feel better, but not come for full visit. Does anyone have a creative way to make this a wellness cash visit vs skilled PT? Our PTA is even offering to get massage license to help offer just massage, but trying to see if anyone has creative ideas on offering it as cash service with the licenses we currently have. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When my clients were "done," I offered up a Continuity Program where they came in 1x/month to make sure things were good and if anything else could have shown up.  I was in a CrossFit gym.  I offered this at a reduced price as long as they signed up for at least 6 mos and if they needed any additional therapy over that 1x/mo visit, I charged my regular fee.

> **Response 2:** If they really want a massage, then hire a massage therapist as an independent contractor, and refer those people to them. Cash basis, no referral needed.

What are ways have you partnered your mobile PT practice with local gyms ? 

I’m meeting w an owner and practicing my sales pitch. I want to find his pain points and see how I can fit in. How can I add value by improving their customer retention and new client conversion ? Ultimately another goal is get my practice name into the community so I can get more word of mouth referrals. 

Unfortunately I am not comfortable marketing myself on social media, I’m better w one to one promotion. 

My ideas:
— Offering onsite 15 min PT screens to existing clients
—Offer post or pre work out manual work and stretching
— Give individual HEPs to their clients who have a history of injury, and have been discharged from PT
—Design different combinations of post workout stretches that could pair up with their small group training programming. 

Say he agrees, and I do these things— how can I measure if my services are helping his bottom line and to prove my worth ? How do I come up with a fair value to be paid for the time I’m spending doing these things? 

Or what other ideas do you have 💡 Do I offer discounts on my mobile PT services to their clients ? Do I just ask them to refer injured clients to me? 

TIA. Pls ask any questions for clarification. I love the expertise of this group and I’m admittedly all over-the- place.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My practice is inside a performance gym and it’s wayyyyy simpler to just pay rent. If you’re friendly with the coaches and owners, they’ll refer you people naturally so I definitely wouldn’t mix their bottom line and yours.

> **Response 2:** You should pay monthly rent and not give them any piece of your ideas. Just keep in mind, the gym may have competition within such as massage, chiro, trainers, etc. if this is the case, they have no incentive to refer to you bc they are collecting from you regardless and yet can filter the income onto their own resources. So it depends ok the situation

## Plans succeed with many advisors...

**Looking to have your plans succeed in 2024? **

**It would be wise to get around many advisors.**

Many advisory groups have been started by the APTA and other organizations, but to be honest, they seem to miss the mark of what a practice owner actually needs.

That is why we created Success Council's - A council of 6-8 practice owners across the country that are in similar revenue range and size to grow in connection and trust with. We say #ironsharpensiron, but the question is - Are you putting yourself around iron?

When you start to run a business, you start to quickly realize that the game that you are playing is vastly different than most people around you, and most of the time...family and friends simply can't relate.

This can be frustrating and isolating. We have created the community where you can grow your own personal board of directors as you grow your company. Other entrepreneurs that you can rely upon for counsel, accountability, collaboration, and support.

If you are interested, comment "Success Council" below! And then, we will get you all of the details.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not only is this Community, it’s FAMILY 🙌🙌💯💯

For those who still market to doctors, what are the effective ways to do it (if there is😏)? What’s your idea of having a liason? Is it worth it considering the expense of hiring one? My questions may be vague, sorry. Just any input will be appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The only doctors who have ever sent me patients are my own primary care and a concierge doc. The rest have all said that they like the idea of what I do and take my cards but have never sent anyone. Also personally I wouldn’t hire someone to go promote my business for me I like to have the person interaction with people to answer questions. Or maybe I’m just a control freak 😁

Had a patient ask if I could do a sports physical for his child. I knew right off the bat that PTs cannot, but it made me actually pause and ask why not? 
"Qualified Practitioners: The annual physical evaluation must be administered either by a licensed physician, a licensed osteopathic physician, a licensed chiropractic physician, a licensed physician assistant, or a certified advanced registered nurse practitioner."
If chiropractors were not on this list, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but food for thought I guess?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I honestly think it should be done by someone that is qualified to listen to heart and lungs and determine if there is abnormalities.  I further think every kids should be having an EKG and echo, but that's an argument for a different place...

> **Response 2:** In our school district, it must be a physician, NP or PA, not a nurse or chiropractor. I would not want to be responsible for clearing a student and they die on the field from heart problems or an asthma attack.

Just an interesting thought. If 7B is not upheld why does 7C…. Or anything else for that matter need to be??? If we are NOT remunerated for our services properly … then nothing else matters. That’s what we were taught our last day of PT school. We were HIGHLY encouraged to NEVER give our services away. Even to family or friends. 
Why can Insurqnce companies break this rule 👀👀👀👀👀👀

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Likely another debate… APTA gets to say whatever they want.  There is no ability to force a payer to negotiate with them.

Josh Payne told me not to worry about about it and that there was still a market for me. Well, three weeks into being full-time at my own practice and I hit my goal of 20 patient visits/week. Thank you, Josh, for the encouragement. I was very surprised and impressed that you spent so much time messaging with us individually.

**Original Post:**
We just got back from rafting the Grand Canyon and I had one of the most resonating experiences I've had in a very long time. Spilling my guts here but I think this group will appreciate the sentiment as well as anyone. 

When I was in college, I had the amazing fortune of working as a river guide for 5 years on the Colorado River, mostly in the Grand Canyon. That job prepared me for working as a PT and especially as a small business owner better than almost any other life experience. 

Rafting the Grand Canyon requires traversing a nearly 300 mile long stretch of river that includes some of the biggest whitewater in North America. We use these huge 37 foot, 4 ton, motorized rafts that can carry up to 20 people at a time. 

I applied for my permit to do this in 1997(!), which was the last year I guided and when I was first starting PT school. It's safe to say that I was going into this a bit rusty because there I was, 25 years later, piloting one of those huge motorized rafts, carrying 16 of my family and friends for 10 days, through historically low water.

As intimidated as I was going into this, one of the best things was how awesome it was to  F E E L the Support and Camaraderie from the other boaters down there, both private and commercial. Mistakes are going to happen and we need each other. Everyone has to camp somewhere at night and we have to unofficially coordinate who is staying where. 

The private trips were smaller and scattered around, most of them hadn't really done it before. The big commercial outfitters were pushing through with their huge groups, either in their motor rigs or with groups of up to 6 smaller rafts. But everyone is a part of the community. Everyone has to work together.

That feeling of support and camaraderie I felt in the Grand Canyon is extremely similar to what I feel in this user group. 
It's the feeling I get when I work with other practice owners who are trying to make their way. 
It's the feeling I get when I volunteer with the Private Practice Section of the APTA. 
And it's the feeling I get when I volunteer for our Home Health and Hospice Association or our local Climbing Advocacy Group.

With so many people running through the Grand Canyon at any given time, things could be a lot more competitive. Fortunately, it was absolutely refreshing and impressive to be a part of a community in which the guides and boatmen from each company and private trip work together to look out for each other. This was true for helping each other through the low water runs as well as for coordinating who was camping where each night.

I'd never seen water that low. Somehow, at every turn, another boatman had my back. This stuff is not easy. 
It's very technical. 
Sometimes it's extremely hot. 
Sometimes there are storms that bring thundering flash floods. 
Sometimes other people get stuck on the rocks and we have to help pull them off.

All of that feels extremely similar when I have random employment questions or regulatory or billing questions. The other 'guides' on our trip are incredibly positive as they rally with each other so we all get down safely.

There is an amazing community experience down in the Grand Canyon! There are also amazing communities here in Uncaged, with the Private Practice Section and with the other associations we have out there.  

Thanks to everyone for looking out for each other! What a cool thing to be a part of!

Should we be obtaining consent from clients before using AI scribes to record their sessions? How should we word it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was not happy an actual person was in the room with a doctor typing our conversation, not introduced, not given consent. Just there creepily a the wall typing staring at their computer. I don't want to ever go back.

> **Response 2:** Yes.  Anytime my practitioners have used it they’ve asked my permission.

I just met a realtor who partners with other businesses. She meets the owners or managers and asks if she can pay for something like a danish at a local coffee shop. Then, she puts their logo and free danish on the front of the card and her info on the back. Easy way to refer someone and for them to see you did it. She’s built relationships with several businesses this way. Last week, I met a concierge pharmacist. She has “natural” pain spray in her pharmacy that costs $10. She agreed for me to partner with her. I’m going to purchase a pain spray for my clients who want to stop by her pharmacy. This way, I send her people who are customem to paying cash and she can do the same for me!  Just wanted to share.

Maybe it’s just me, but does anyone else struggle with constantly seeing coaches or trainers tip-toeing the line by offering “pain-free” services or any other synonym outside of diagnoses, rehab, and physical therapy? 

In the past month (could be from algorithms), I’ve seen more courses, often PTs or chiros, luring fitness professionals to increase their revenue by offering these services. More often than not it’s just a rebranded movement screen. 

I want to be able to educate the general public and the fitness professional of the potential danger and build working relationships respecting one another. Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The shift by some PT's to wellness will bring  different competition into play.  Some therapists want to move away from treatments that have board oversight to those that don't.  Many therapists offer a nice mix of both.  Personal trainers and other types of fitness coaches also work in the wellness field.

> **Response 2:** This is not something I worry about.

I would like to get my strong referral partners a small holiday gift. 

I have one medical practice that refers to me often and I'd like to buy the office coffee or something similar but I have 2 questions that I was hoping people could weigh in on:
* Is this allowed? I'm just thinking of anti-kickback stuff and how incentivizing referrals between medical providers is sometimes not allowed. But I'm also not entirely sure of the specific rules.
* Does this come off as too much of a drug rep move?

Thanks for your thoughts!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As long as the gift is not tied to the number of referrals, it's fine per my memory

> **Response 2:** I sent locally made cookies to the chiro office next to me for everyone to share and small initial bracelets to my closest referrals.. doulas, midwives, etc.

Does any clinic owner here have a good Facebook ad agency or group that has helped them get leads/patients from Facebook ads successfully, that they can recommend? I have tried Facebook ads on my own for my practice and didn't get much from them, so just looking for help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Best decision and investment I made!

I did Launchpad back in January or February and now I’m in the Pathway program (started around April)

My background: I worked for a larger private practice in my county (CA) and was clinic director of one of their offices for the last 2 years. I always knew I wanted to do something on my own. I had the dream and game plan. But didn’t have the final drive. Most likely from fear of “not making it” and making it hard on my wife and kids. At the same time, I was getting burnt out with the “caged” clinic I was at.

I was blessed to talk to David Bayliff, who gave me the inspiration and answered many of my business related questions before I joined.

I had a minor in Business Admin in college and have learned more about business (with a true emphasis on clinicians) through Launchpad and Pathway than any of my college courses. They motivate you, educate you, keep you accountable, provide you resources, and celebrate you.

I officially became Uncaged at the end of April. I’m a hybrid mobile (mostly)  PT seeing cash and Medicare. I have made 2 contracts with 2 gyms in the county where I see clients (mostly their clients) in their gyms. I’m getting pretty close to making as much as I was at my previous job (if you take into account the different expenses my business now pays for). I’m starting to prepare on hiring another PT (my goal is the end of the year).

I wouldn’t have made the jump without Uncaged. Wouldn’t have built a solid networking group without Uncaged. Wouldn’t have had a solid foundation without Uncaged. Wouldn’t have thought about contracting with any gyms without Uncaged. Lucky to have Uncaged as I plan to grow.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions!

> **Response 2:** The best advice is to hop on a call and see if we fit what you’re looking for. If you don’t trust the program or coaches you work with no program will work so find who you align with

**Original Post:**
Question(s) about a cash-based gym opportunity. This would be my first foray into such a practice model so I’m really relying on others’ experience with this.

There is a new gym opening in my area. They are offering 10x12 clinic rooms as contracted space. They will provide a scheduling and payment platform/EMR, supplies (including table, needles, IASTM tools, cups, etc). Referrals would likely be easy, because it’ll be gym members and their personal training clients. I would still operate under my own LLC and liability insurance. Their offer is a 50/50 split on whatever income my appointments make. Given the conditions above, does this seem like good terms? If not, what would you say is “standard” in the industry with this type of set up? When we met, I suggested 30 minute appointments at a flat rate of $75 per client, which would include any manual therapy, needling, etc, with the impression these would be the services most clients in the gym would be looking for. Does this seem like reasonable pricing?

Sorry if these are questions that get asked a million times.

Thanks in advance for any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree with the above. 37.50 is just what your business gets, not even what you need to pay taxes on, what you pay yourself, and general business expenses which will be taken out of what. That offer would be a big no go for me.

> **Response 2:** I think readers misread the post. 

$37.50 per half hour, $75 per hour isn’t bad if you aren’t paying rent, you aren’t paying for supplies, and you aren’t paying for marketing. 

That’s not bad. 

Then you could negotiate a higher rate for clients you bring in that aren’t members.

I’m pretty sure I just made a referral source for patients w/ TMD chatting up the dentist at my appointment. The dentist seemed really interested in what I had to say and asked me to drop off a stack of my business cards for them to hand out to patients so unless he was blowing smoke at me I think I made a good connection. 

This is exciting since it will only be my second outside provider referral source I’ve made. I’m building slowly, but I’m steadily building. #BuildingBridges

I’m a solo cash based lymph specialist. For the past 5 months, my caseload is almost exactly where I want it. I’m meeting with a local plastics group (about 8 surgeons) to discuss possibility of a collaboration including offering packages to their patients. I currently am treating one of their surgeons’ patients occasionally. I don’t want to offer visits at a discount because I’m currently not looking to expand my caseload much further than what it already is. Any suggestions or advice?

Since Mississippi now has direct access, I am considering starting my cash practice back up. I haven’t explored it yet, but I could possibly have an opportunity to provide PT at a local gym. 

My question is for those who currently have space at a gym: how do you differentiate your services from a personal trainer’s? Do you only do rehabilitation and then hand them over to the personal trainer? I want to have a plan together before I approach the owner, and I definitely don’t want the personal trainer to feel like I am taking any of her business.

I'm sure this group will relate, but I recently realized I am not providing the quality patient care I would like to because of all the flaming hoops insurance has put up. I am going to make the jump to cash based and have a question for the group. 

I am in a pretty small town so I will likely need a side job as I get started. I am a physical therapist with over 15 years of outpatient experience in orthopedics and pelvic health. I am fairly certain my current employer will not be willing to let me gradually transition out. I am not picky, it doesn't have to be PT related or even in the medical/fitness field. Any suggestions?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s a little different animal going cash based and I’ve found the expectations are more like a trainer (I want this, this and this) than in insurance world because they are putting their own money up.  If you can fill in the gaps getting some fitness world exposure that would be helpful because for a lot of patients that is the choice they are making with their dollar (trainer vs. PT)

> **Response 2:** Small isolated town could work in your favor. Word of mouth will be a strong potential for referral. But if socioeconomics are not appropriate you will have more difficulty. Explaining difference between insurance based and private access is critical. Let patients know in many cases they are already paying for the bulk of the cost. Explain as private pay you time with them is devoted to them not paperwork for insurance company. Explain the process of reimbursement and authorizations and how that limits outpatient therapists ability to treat within full scope and autonomy. Not everyone will be interested but those that are will be. Need to show what the benefits will be to them. IE faster appointment scheduling, coming to their home or place of work, potentially fewer sessions needed, no waiting for authorizations, referrals, additional visits. Building a whole body wellness mindset starting with a relationship with a provider who can screen and make recommendations how they can feel better, be healthier…Your business model will reflect what those benefits are to the patients.

Thoughts on follow up calls with doctors offices? I have dropped into a couple and spoke with staff there and they seemed receptive and like there’s a need in the area. Haven’t heard anything in a couple weeks from most of them. Was thinking of giving a call today. Wanted everyone’s opinion on this

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been doing a lot of research and it can take a long time to have MDs refer to you, I’ve read most success comes from patients telling MDs about you. But of course there’s no exact science

> **Response 2:** I had a patient I saw. Then he went into the hospital and needed “home PT” he had them send me the order since no RN ordered. The dr office called back the next day asking if I can really do this and if so why don’t other people do it?!?? Hahahaha I don’t know you tell me 🫣

What do y'all do to show gratitude to referral sources? (Not looking for lunch/pastries bribes or any kick-back junk). I basically have 2 MD's and one HH company responsible for 3/4 of my caseload. I always try to refer as many people as I can to those doc's. But I just feel like I need to do more, show how thankful I am. 
I like Anthony Maritato's idea of posting interviews with them to a blog/vlog/yt page, but I don't have that all set up yet. 
Other ideas?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Best thing you can do is make their job easier - have the patient send a quick thank you note to the doctor for sending them to you- makes the doc look like the hero.   They will send more   Have a bunch of basic thank you cards and ask the patient to write a quick thank you and send

> **Response 2:** I'll be featuring them in a Partners area on my website, and also take chocolates from a local business and a hand-written note.  As I'm just starting out, it's a small token. But being in a smallish town, supporting local business is a big thing.

My business is Out of network and we bill under a group npi. I formerly worked for a large PT mill that was in network with all plans (>3 years ago). I occasionally get patients who call and say they contacted their plan and that I am in network with their insurance but I explain that I am not. Anyone know if there is a way to get “off the list”? Is that something I should contact the former company about or directly to each plan? I’m sure one of you have been in the same boat.

Hey everyone!
Recently started my own cash based PT clinic inside my CrossFit gym in October. Looking to treat overhead athletes- CrossFit, softball, baseball, etc. 
I was just a 5/6am athlete, but have been trying to go to other class times so different athletes can learn who I am. 
Once softball/baseball tournaments start back up I’d like to set up a table there. 
Any advice for ways to get new patients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used to do free consults in my gym once per month.  15 min and occasionally invited a doc to join me. In NYC that’s golden. He got a few new patients that needed a formal office  visit. For the basic strains and tendinitis issues he gave them a script to see me. Overall we elevated the prestige of the club and gym members got a sweet deal.  In return our patients got a small discount if they joined the club after they were DC from PT

Hi, any strategies for getting POCs signed by physicians? One physician's medical assistant said she'll place it on the physician's desk to be signed again. It's my 3rd request in 3 weeks. If I do not get it back within 30 days, I assume I would have to pause the patient's POC? Does it help to visit the office and personally make the request or are there better strategies you'd recommend?

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unfortunately it is what it is my friend. What we have been doing are these.

1. Ask patient to call MD office
2. Drop of the actual print out in a nice paper and marketing materials.
3. Ask patient to go back to their MD for follow up visit and bring your POC.
4. Fax everyday and document.
5. Hire a VA team to do this for you.
6. Keep going.

> **Response 2:** Tell the patient, have them advocate to the physician for you. 

Physicians listen to their patients (customers) and want to keep them satisfied.

Edit: Relevant story that I just had this month. Pt referred to PT (order sent to affiliated PT clinic to PCP office). Pt reached out to me for PT. Eval completed, faxed in for endorsement with nice note. MA calls me saying physician is not willing to sign the POC because I’m not a provider she is familiar with and “ordered PT from a different company”. 

I told the patient, she called while I was with her and made a fuss. POC was faxed and returned within the hour.

This has been a long-time coming for us at Uncaged...

We have known since the beginning of this group that practice owners NEED community, and need support as you run a business.

Many advisory groups have been started by the APTA and other organizations, but to be honest, they seem to miss the mark of what a practice owner actually needs.

That is why we created Success Council's - A council of 6-8 practice owners across the country that are in similar revenue range and size to grow in connection and trust with. We say #ironsharpensiron, but the question is - Are you putting yourself around iron?

When you start to run a business, you start to quickly realize that the game that you are playing is vastly different than most people around you, and most of the time...family and friends simply can't relate.

This can be frustrating and isolating. We have created the community where you can grow your own personal board of directors as you grow your company. Other entrepreneurs that you can rely upon for counsel, accountability, collaboration, and support.

If you are interested, comment "Success Council" below and we will get you all of the details!

For those who have done a price increase, and sent an email to patients to inform them of the change…did you send to your entire list of patients, or just those seen in the last 1-2 years, or just active patients? Curious where to draw the line on the mass email, or perhaps it’s just easier to send to everyone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I only change prices on new POCs. So I don’t have to have that very conversation with current clients lol. If they discharge and come back later then they have the new price. So I just put that information on the website. If a returning client comes, I’ll let them know that prices have gone up since last time they were there.

> **Response 2:** I’ve only sent to current clients & my seasonal folks - I consider them “current” as well even if it’s off season. I am wellness based so majority of my people/animals are long term. Interested to see what others do

I keep going back and forth on this, and have already been told I’m overthinking it: If my husband is a gym owner, and I am a coach/employee. As a PT, can I provide the occasional cash based PT services, billed from the gym? I’d make my normal hourly rate (🤣 nothing) — it’s not about making money here, so I’m not really wanting to invest a ton in a separate business. BUT I would like to contribute to the success of our gym as my time allows and be able to help people out who ask for my services. I assume I need only my own professional liability coverage? The gym already has general liability… Am I missing something here from a professional/legal aspect? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** teach classes about physical therapy, topics, pain, injury, days and nights.

I treat a specialty with very few providers who are knowledgeable and available for me to use as referral sources. A good portion of my patients are also part of the lgbtq+ community. A patient recently brought to my attention that one of the few providers I have referred them to is on a website that is essentially Amazon for the far right. I don't feel like I can continue to refer patients part of the lgbtq+ community to this provider. So ethically
1) I don't think I'm going to refer to them at all anymore. Not any patients
2) I don't think I need to tell this provider why. I can just....stop. 
3) what do I do about patients already seeing him. I don't want to interrupt a relationship that is working. But some of these patients would definitely not be comfortable if they knew about this.

*there's no way theyre accidentally on there. You have to create an account and step by step click that you agree with the values in order to be posted on it. So this is something they sought out and did intentionally 

Just looking for....thought? Opinions? Guidance?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is America. Do what you want but expect reciprocity. You start to alienate your referrals sources d/t political ideologies then you’re going to lose business. As healthcare providers we treat regardless of personal beliefs and should be judgement free. If someone has a different political alignment than myself, big whoop. Avoid the topic and treat to the best of your ability. Let your patients make their own decisions on who they want or don’t want to see. 

I would also assume you are showing professionalism by not bad mouthing another healthcare provider to patients.

> **Response 2:** A therapist selling items on Public Square will cause you to stop sending them patients? Even if they have delivered great care to your clients?

SEO anyone?

I have had my brick and mortar practice for 4 years, and have been thriving for this long on word of mouth and direct referrals. I hired on another PT and now have to fill their schedule. I have a website, but never went down the rabbit hole of SEO and really worrying about my online presence. Where do I start? Do I hire someone, do an online program? I dont know anything about making my website get in front of the people who need to see it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hire Jenny Gill or Corey Hiben for a consult or a project. 

Do not hire some rando who doesn’t really care about therapists. The results are dismal. 

If you want to learn SEO, you can. Therapists are plenty smart to learn it… but I’d consider if you want to spend your time/energy or spend money. 

I understand and help people with SEO occasionally, but it’s not my specialty, so I’m throwing Jenny & Corey’s names in as far better options. 😆 

ChatGPT is only as good as the person promoting it, so there’s no guarantee what you’ll get. It’s like asking it for an ACL rehab program - you’ll get something, and it may not be half bad, but if you don’t know what the output is supposed to be you won’t know if it’s good or bad. 

Congrats on your biz growth!! 🥳

I'm a LMT and own a lymphatic clinic.  I'm considering hiring a OT to help with lymphatics and offer dry needling. What are some of the liability insurance providers for OTs? Can OTs work without MD referrals and create their own care plans?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it's state dependent on what the practice act actually says.  If the state has open access for OTs then they should be able to see clients without referrals. Usually there are guidelines and stipulations though, so it's important to be aware of what each specific state says.

I use google voice for my business number and it has been serving me just fine. Until about 2 months ago when I started getting a ridiculous number of spam calls. Like 10 from the same number within 15 minutes. Multiple times a day. I would mark them as spam numbers so that the call wouldn’t come through. But now I’m not getting any calls on that number. It will only show the missed spam calls I get. But if I get a call from a person looking for my business it doesn’t ring, it doesn’t even show on my call history. I will only know to call them back if they leave a message. Which is super frustrating and results in more phone tag than necessary. I’ve searched the settings on the app and I don’t see anything I can do to change this. Anyone experienced this and know what to do??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My Google voice gets spammed a lot, too 😒 I essentially changed my voicemail to say something along the lines of "I'm probably busy with a patient, so please leave a voicemail, or you can probably get a hold of me quicker with a text message," and I almost always get a text from prospective patients. I haven't found a good way to sort out the spam calls, though 😑

My reach has decreased 57% over the last month while my content has stayed the same and my page views have gone up 94%.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just had this happen too, my first review and it got deleted. I talked to someone from Google and since a bot deleted it they said they can't recover it 😭

> **Response 2:** Yes, this is an ongoing technical problem at Google. Their bots are patrolling reviews and removing existing reviews and / or blocking new ones, seemingly at random. I've actually spoken to a human at Google about this, and they're very aware of the problem but I've not been notified of a resolution to the issue. The support staff also said that once a bot has removed a review, or denied a new one, there's no recovering it.

Any PTs here do coaching for runners? I have a cash based mobile PT side gig and have been able to get well entrenched in our running community and started coaching some athletes on a month by month subscription basis and wondering if anybody else more experience in this area. Looking for any information/strategies people have taken in this area combining PT/coaching.  Thank you 🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Initially I also focus on injury prevention just as Denise Fontana Smith described.  Also,  patient’s will transition to my coaching program & technique training during the latter phases of rehab (if their goal is to return to running).  I spend 1-2 days/week coaching and programming for folks who are preparing for a race or in the military. Another strategy is to do some small group sessions for runners who have similar goals or experience level. I don’t do that anymore, but it seemed to work well.  Let me know if you have any specific questions.

> **Response 2:** We do along with running technique training.  The coaching field is crowded so we focus more on injuries (treatment and prevention) and design programs around that. Smith Physical Therapy and Running Academy

What are some pros I can highlight to show the benefit of physical therapy 😊 what is beneficial for them? This is my first time doing this so I am a bit nervous. And also how do I maximize my personal benefit of having a gym that I am able to work through? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don't talk about you. Ask them what their problems are and solve those. When talking with gym owners, I tell them that I want to help their members stay healthy and fit so they can KEEP going to their gym which ultimately means less cancelled memberships for their gym.

> **Response 2:** Tell them you will increase memberships as you will help those that wouldn’t feel comfortable at the gym, stay at the gym once you discharge them. They want paying members!

Question for mobile PTs: Do you provide clients with free resistance bands? 

I would of course bring some good quality bands with me to use during treatments, but supplying them with a piece cut off of a theraband roll just doesn’t seem like enough (resistance is too light for most of my clients anyways). 

I was thinking a “welcome gift” of a nice set of loop bands might be a nice touch, but I’m also just starting out & trying to keep overhead costs low.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I provide mini bands.

> **Response 2:** If a patient needs theraband for their HEP, I do give it to them. As a mobile/telehealth practice, I have found if I tell the patients to get the band themselves, they’ll never do it. It’s an easy thing to provide for them and they get better quicker. ￼

Also, planning to use video for YouTube and Facebook so portrait or landscape?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** YouTube videos need to be in landscape mode. I find that landscape mode gives more space for moving around, especially when you're sitting or lying down. As mentioned before, keep the background simple and clutter-free, and wear solid colors that contrast well so that you don't blend into the background. Have fun with this!

HELP! I need some advice! I’m currently in a crossfit gym and they are most likely going to close down. I have the opportunity to move in a 2000 sq foot office however cost for that space ranges from 2600-2750 per month. In my area, 2000 sq ft goes for 4K a month. I had a great month of March but things have been slowing down the last two months. I don’t know if I should take the leap and get the space. 

I did get an offer from another crossfit gym in another town to lease out 850 sq ft for $800. However, that is only making a lateral move not a progressive one. 

Curious if anyone would take the leap despite things being slow or going for a cheaper and safer bet and moving into another crossfit gym in another town??

Any advice would be appreciated. 🙏🏻🙏🏻

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How does the 2000’ space fit into your long term plan? Do you plan to hire and grow? How many therapists/ visits per month could that space accommodate and does that align with your goals?

> **Response 2:** This is my perspective coming as someone who does CrossFit and is a fan of it. 

CrossFit seems somewhat shaky as leadership continues to change and they don’t provide adequate or the best support to affiliate owners (this may be localized to where I’m located, but I see it a lot on comments on their online platforms as well). More gyms are starting to close. 

Taking that into consideration, you really need to evaluate the new CrossFit gym you are looking at if that’s really the move you want. How are they marketing? Are they attracting the clientele you want to treat? How many new members are joining on average monthly? All of that considering if you are trying to use them as a referral source.

Hey folks! I have a cash based concierge PT practice and I wanted to add a page on my website for clients to purchase a recommended product. I’m not familiar with a dropshipping versus affiliate. Ideally I don’t want to have a physical inventory and would like to make something on the sale if it’s coming from my site. The products I would have are specialized within the lymphedema and pelvic health client populations.  Has anyone had experience with this? If so what sites have you used? TIA!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, you want affiliate. I've done both for years but affiliate is much easier and less headache. You can do Amazon, but also googling "product name affiliate" will tell you where you can sign up. I'd first make a list of all the products you already recommend to clients and start there.

> **Response 2:** Yes!! Be an affiliate. Amazon is super easy or if there is a company that you love, see if they have an affiliate option 🙂 Super simple to add your affiliate link on your website.

When you guys started out on your own side gigs, did you have your own website?  How did you avoid alerting attention to your current employer?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** got my website 2 full years after starting to see patients privately in their homes and making my PLLC. i didn't do or say anything to my employers. maybe it's less of an issue because the hospitals i work at are quite a distance away from where i live/see private patients 🤷🏼 i feel like little ol me coming to your house to give you PT for cash is a totally different thing than hospital based outpatient PT that accepts all kinds of insurance, medicaid, etc. it's not really a competition.

> **Response 2:** Nope no website. It was word of mouth. And my employer back then knew I was doing home visits, I was not able to solicit my services when I was working for their clinic.

But check with the contract you signed because some times there’s a ridiculous non-compete clause.

Post pricing on website or just on booking site?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I decided to post on my website and am not regretting it. Don't think it's really deterred people, but definitely just saved some time in discussing it when people have already seen it. Although almost all of my marketing is word of mouth and not a lot of Google/Facebook ads or people that don't already know my model when they are referred to me.

> **Response 2:** I like having mine on there. As a consumer I like to know. I feel it makes the conversation easier for me when it's time. I have had anyone complain.

I have no experience with digital ads.  Wondering if I should start with Google ads or FB ads?  Can I do this myself?  Do you recommend a specific person or agency to help with this?  Any help is appreciated! Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Think about where you’re driving traffic to… 

Because if you pay for traffic and have a colander to pour them in instead of a funnel you’re wasting money. 

I’ve been targeted for so many PT clinic ads from places across the country it kills me — because I’m not their ideal client, I’m not even in the same state.

Do you have Google My Business set up? 

Next — is your website optimized for SEO for your location? (Like if I type “physical therapy in Houston, TX” you want to appear) 

Then once a person gets to your website is it super clear who you help and how they can book? 

Every time people ask how to get more patients in this group people say word of mouth and Google. 

I’m not an ads expert, but I wouldn’t pour money into it until you have the organic pieces in place first. 🙂 

But if you have a digital product/service and a solid funnel set up, then I say get an ads person to create a plan 😉

> **Response 2:** Join this group and sign-up with their BOOKED program. The course will teach you how to start running and maintaining your clinic's FB ads. You wont regret it!

Vendor/Rehab tent at CrossFit events:

My gym wants me to setup a Pre-hab/Rehab tent at all their upcoming local competitions that I can be available for. This is huge because they are the largest CrossFit community in Utah County with 6 gyms total. This would mean a lot ton of visibility and a big way I think for me to build some credibility within the local CrossFit community. 

I need some help with figuring out what services to provide, maybe prizes to contribute to the competitors, marketing materials to have available, ways to pull in leads, the works. I’ve never done anything like this and this feels really like a golden opportunity that I really don’t want to screw up. 

I will take any and all guidance on how to fully capitalize on this opportunity. I feel like if things go well with one or two events they will likely be really open to me setting up workshops as well, haven’t broached that subject. 

I have a ton of CrossFit experience so I know the movements extremely well, I understand the common injuries, but I don’t know the ins and outs of stepping into this role. It’s new and different and I’m just a little afraid to mess up a good thing so I really want to do it right. 

Thank you in advance. You can email any suggestions to briancollinsdpt@revitalize3d.com or DM as well. Posting in the comments section is cool too.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely grab emails, do mini sessions for 10 minutes every 15 minutes to give you a chance to connect. If you’re able, have someone with you to help keep you organized and see if they want to book a full session with you and get them set up with an appointment. For prizes you could offer a free or half off session. 

If you do want to charge for something, check with your gym if you have to pay a fee to them. I’ve worked some competitions where if I charged, I would have to pay the organizers a fee or percentage whereas if I did free services, no charge for me. I’ve also done taping at events with moderate success. Good luck, sounds like an awesome opportunity!

Hello! I am looking for physical therapist in California who provides online wellness/coaching services. I am interested in paying for these services for 1-2 months! 
I am looking to start my own online physical therapy/wellness business soon and i feel like receiving these services will not only help me with my fitness/health goals but also my business goals.
Does this work for anybody?

PS: open to the possibility of a paid mentor/business coach  afterwards but I am not committing to this yet

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm not doing mobile PT at the moment but can help walk you through the CA setup process

We are located in Northern San Diego County and also I do offer business coaching to people just starting up as long as they're not in certain areas where I have another student already.

It’s TIME for you to find the community that you have been looking for. 

We are going to make waves 🌊 of change together in 23 days in Denver. 

This is not your normal “Here is a list of all of our amazing speakers” type of event, but so so so much more than that. 

It’s an experience that will provide you with TRUE momentum in your life and business.

Not the fluffy momentum that fades within a week after leaving the event.

Motivation is fleeting, but deep inspiration can last forever. 

You will meet a community that will be with you for life. 

There is an energy and momentum that God is building within this community that you really can only experience in person. 

23 days…LET’S GO!!!!

To those providers that live in Florida, I am a cash only PT and need to know what are the laws concerning Wellness sessions? 

How is Wellness defined in Florida?

Do we need a physician to sign off on the POC after 30 days as we do with direct access? 

How many sessions are allowed? 

What ICD 10 codes are used?

Do we need short and long term goals?

Please add any other relevant information.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No physician sign off required, no POC required, no minimum days it's based on what you and your client want. No ICD 10 codes required.

We should be utilizing short and long-term goals. Even good personal trainers do that. I also write up an assessment. Even if you look at some of the assessments in the personal training space, they are quite thorough. I look at joint mobility, ROM, lumbopelvic stability, screen for pelvic health issues, and assess functional movements and balance. And I write it all up just like I would for a PT assessment. Well actually I dictate it using Google docs, it's pretty fast. 

For the regular sessions for most of my training clients, I use a spreadsheet on a clipboard. It also contains an area for the assessment and plan and anything they may have told me that session. Essentially a spreadsheet soap note format.

> **Response 2:** Wellness and cash based PT are 2 different things completely. 
If you are training someone (which is essentially wellness), it’s not function based and it’s not diagnosis based.  It’s instead generalized mobility and strengthening.  It’s not sit<>stand function, it’s “squats”, etc. 
It’s a mindset shift.  Notes are minimal and basically are non assessment check lists of the exercises performed.  

•No MD signatures. 
•No ICD codes 
•As many sessions as you want. 
•No goals needed unless you want some fitness threshold goals. 
•depends on “client” demographic too. 

Think I got a little  wordy/redundant, but hopefully some clarification in there somewhere 😆

We did it 10+ yrs ago and still get things addressed to old name. Only thing worse is address change. 
SEO is dead so it might be your chance to refresh that approach!!

I work in an OP ortho - long hours everyday. I’ve been feeling burnout mainly from working so hard and going above and beyond besides just treating and I want to do that for myself and reap the benefits.

The gym I go to doesn’t have a PT and I feel like this is something I can bring. Has anyone done that? How to go about it? Any feedback helps.

**Community Responses:**

Question:  I'm an OT who recently launched a website, www.allplacesrehab.com, that allows therapists and therapy centers to list their services for free.  There is also an option to be featured for a small monthly fee.  I'm excited about the idea of having a platform for therapists and clients to connect.  I think it is a much needed resource.  As therapists and clinics owners, what would entice you to sign up?

**Community Responses:**

Good morning! How do you go about re-engaging with previous referral sources? I've had a drop in my referrals from other providers. I have spent time connecting trying to foster genuine relationships, asking to meet for coffee, going to local provider meetings, I've sent thank you cards/small gifts around the holidays, etc. However, I feel like when you through busy seasons sometimes those relationships lose connection. I know I'm giving great care so I can't fault myself there. Just looking for some ideas.

**Community Responses:**

Hey everyone! Quick question- if I am a direct access state and cash pay business ( accepting no insurance) do I need a doctors signature on a super bill for the dx code? 

Total newbie here and deciding whether or not to take the plunge in providing patients with a super bill! 

Thanks All!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No, superbills aren't related to direct access. They are simply a statement provided to the patient to be potentially reimbursed by insurance or to have it potentially count towards their deductible. 

Direct access based upon your state dictates if and how long you can see the patient before a referral/prescription for therapy is needed. 

I hope this helps! 

And congrats & good luck 😀

> **Response 2:** check your state licensure laws.  if u are providing skilled services, it doesnt matter to your state board if u r cash or accept ins.    u still need to follow the law.  unskilled is a different story.

I have over 200 hours of pre-recorded Osteoporosis Strength, Balance and Yoga classes I'm trying to figure out where/how to store somewhere online and leave available for purchase or monthly rentals without having to pay for storage on my website (as I have been doing), now that I'm not running new classes. Any suggestions? Is there a platform that will host without charging and just take a percentage of sales? OR should I load onto Youtube and try to monetize that way somehow (Anthony Maritato YouTube guru do you have an opinion this route?)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The easiest would be upload to YouTube and if you want to sell access you leave them as unlisted videos and simply email the link after purchase. 

You could also upload to YouTube, keep them unlisted and embed the video on your webpage. 

I never uploaded actual video to my webhost. I always hosted on YouTube and embedded the video on my webpage, even when it was behind a paywall.

> **Response 2:** That's awesome!  Please share the link no matter where you decide!

Would love some advice…
I have a mobile vestibular PT clinic and was approached by a PT (I met a few months ago) about a potential collaboration. She has a well established ortho clinic for 15 years, a few miles from my house. Her front office says they frequently get calls for vestibular services. She would like to advertise that her clinic offers vestibular services (through my practice) but I would remain my own entity. She would like to have a meeting, but her “soft proposal” was for me to pay her rent to use her space (for example Monday and Wednesday from 9-12) as well as referral fee for advertising on her website that she says gets a lot of traffic. 

I currently have no overhead and am seeing a handful of self-referred Medicare patients through Luna. I get referrals from word of mouth, Google searches, my own marketing efforts to ENTs, neurologists and concierge practices and from the hospital I used to work for. 

I’d love some thoughts on what I should negotiate. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Stay independent and let her refer to you. Unless she’s willing to share a practice so you get the credit for your expertise, someone else is benefitting from you.

> **Response 2:** I wouldn’t do it if you would still see them through Luna. They don’t pay enough for this model to make sense

Does anyone know if there is a company that takes physical therapists into higher end resorts ￼ to work with clients during their vacations?  

There’s fitness pros that allows people to go to resorts and teach fitness classes, but wondering if there’s anything like that for physical therapist? 

￼ I know there’s a lot more legalities that go through with licensing, but it’s definitely possible-just wondering if someone’s already doing it or if it’s worth creating …

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am a PT. I've traveled to the carribean for 2 yoga fitness vacations as a yoga teacher, RYT. The beauty of it is max 2 hours of 'work' per day.

Hey y'all, mobile PT here trying to get myself established in my community. I'm reaching out to all the local gyms to introduce myself, say hello, and ask if they're cool with me coming in and working with people who may happen to have memberships at their gyms already. Do you offer to help gym owners/employees with treatment for themselves? 
What else do you recommend asking gyms when meeting with them? This is all new to me and I feel like I'm horrible at selling myself, but I know I need to put in the work and get out in the community. Any advice is greatly appreciated! I'm meeting with two tomorrow!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should be trying to fill a need that the gym has (people pausing memberships, canceling, etc due to injury). You're selling a solution to a problem they have. Try to find out what their problems are and go from there. Partnership goes both ways.

> **Response 2:** I had a few gym owners ask me to look at a client or their own pain as sort of a test to make sure I was good.  One uses me if she has clients in my area, the other I actually have a revenue share agreement with so I can hold classes and see patients using his equipment.  Other gym owners just brushed me off (one of those just asked if I could work with her gym now lol).  It’s been helpful for me starting out because they have the clients and I don’t.  Once I get a following then I’ll re evaluate, but never count on more than 30% of business coming from a gym you work with.

Anyone have any suggestions on marketing ideas? I'm supposed to open a prenatal/postpartum group fitness and physical therapy studio Evolution Mom NJ  in January and I've gotten a decent amount of traffic to my website but no bites yet, that is just with local doc visits (haven't gotten past the front desk)using social media and a local daycare email list. I've been doing what I can to boost my Google ranking but it's hard since I'm not technically open yet! 

I'm wondering if it's just bc I'm not open till Jan but was hoping to have had some inquiries/class registrations...

also not sure how to grow the local social media following? 

Any ideas!? 

Thanks in advance! This group has been so helpful in getting to this point!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** One idea could be doing a workshop at a local library or other venue to give people a chance to get to know you and the specific problems you solve. 

Maybe even a free class at the end of the workshop to let people experience the services you offer.

> **Response 2:** Congrats! I def agree with the above, find some mom groups online and offline, offer a free workshop or class, and get to know your local midwives and doulas. 
For the website, which is beautiful btw, you may want to change a few things on your site structure. It's difficult to tell that you need to register or purchase classes on site from the homepage and from the schedule page. Also, instead of registering for a class it just adds it to the cart which can be confusing for people if not explained. Try updating that and adding more calls to action on the homepage so people have more direction. You can break up the longer paragraphs so only 1-2 sentences are together so it reads easier. 
As far as SEO, the site is missing important meta data, image alt text, the H1-H4 headers aren't appropriate, and try optimizing for local keywords. That should help your local search a lot, although Google can take up to 6 mo to show a site in search, you can manually submit the sitemap to speed that up.
Don't forget you need a popup for cookie approval to be compliant and a website privacy policy (you have HIPAA but you need a website one also or you can combine the two on one page). Just pick one social to concentrate on, you can always share the same things across tt, fb, and insta too.

Business owners…

1) Know your identity. 
2) Carry that into relationships with your clients. 
3) it will sharpen your purpose.

It all starts with identity. If you don’t know what values you or your business has, you will never be able to create a culture that lives out those values.

Despite all the rage online about different diets, what I love about nutrition is the basic rules for success always stay the same. 🥩 🍎 🥦 🍚 

You see, what I love about the truth is it stays steady. It’s unwavering. Always. Anything that is not truthful comes and goes, and eventually fades away. 🌊 

The rules for success in business also don’t change nearly as much as it seems. Sure, changes in the market can change different factors…but at its core, it stays the same. 

This is my second post for a second day in a row to remind you to keep it simple 😀.

For mobile therapists, are we allowed to see Medicare B pts in their ALF?  Or is there a rule by Medicare that they only be seen by inhouse therapists?  Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** People have the right to choose their providers. That is their home- I would argue that they can have anyone come to their home to provide therapy. I haven't gotten clients yet, but I've had 2 marketing people from ALFs admit that to me.  Now they may not want to promote you since it conflicts with their in house therapists.

Hello all!
I'm finally ready to start knocking on some doors to get referrals. Anyone here care to share their experience on how to even go about setting an appointment to talk to these MDs? Also, what's a good opener?
I'm usually shy, but I know that's not acceptable when trying to get your private practice off the ground😅
I'm a concierge mobile vestibular physical therapist, so my target referral sources would be neurologists, ENTs & Audiologists. 
TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m just getting started with this too. I have a friend who is an MD who I asked about this. He said what works best is to call ahead and ask 
1) who would be the best person to talk to for referrals in the office
2) ask what time is normally down time for them
3) make it quick and efficient. …he said meeting you face to face is nice, but he’s very busy so 5 min or less is preferred.

> **Response 2:** Hey there! I also started mobile vestibular practice too!!! I have since transitioned to renting a space but would love to chat! ☺️
In all honesty I haven’t had too much success with going to doctors, even ENT and neurologists. I’ve done door knocking, phone calls, scheduled lunch and learns, scheduled myself as a patient (I have my own issues too! Lol) and well… I get most of my clients with direct marketing. I’m so excited for you! Would love to share what’s worked (and what hasn’t for me haha)

21 days until Uncaged LIVE…Uncaged is a family.

And there is a reason why we don’t have a live streaming option…it’s a culture that you can only truly experience in person. 

My guarantee: There hasn’t been an event for Uncaged clinicians in our field like this one, not even close. 

It’s an experience that will have you walking away filled with inspiration, proof, knowledge, friends for life, and the understanding of how to build a business that is actually sustainable 💯 

It’s an environment that the person next to you, even though they may not know you, actually wants to get to know you and see you win 🥇 

We invest in eachother, we guide eachother, we mentor eachother, we build eachother up. 

Denver, CO October 6-9th ⛰ The mountains are calling for more therapists to join the movement that is changing healthcare…

Adding nursing or companion services to my therapy company:
I am curious if anybody has ever added concierge nursing to their business model? My husband is an RN and we have discussed recently, adding him to my business, to provide private concierge nursing to some of my clients who need at times entire weekend coverage. ￼ The clients in question, do not have any significant medical problems, other than dementia, so the clients ￼are not medically complex. This would essentially be a more highly skilled caregiver and companion. Would love to pick your brain if you have done this.

W2 vs 1099? Looking for the most tax beneficial and clean way to do this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Love the idea. Be sure you aren't running into a business practice that overlaps with licensure for a home health entity. Some states will say that if you provide nursing and therapy in the home, you would look like a home health entity. Even if it's private pay.

> **Response 2:** Not a nurse, but I thought about adding my girlfriend who is a family practice physician.

For Medicare clients can missed visits be made up the following week? 
I.e if POC is for 1x a week can you see client 2x next week if client had to cancel or is going out of town, etc

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Please refer to CMS transmittal 88. It clearly addresses this situation. I don’t think any amendments have been made to it since it was issued that I am aware. The short answer is: Medicare B does allow for variation from the weekly frequency as long as the total visits on the certification period remains the same based on that source document. Documentation for the reason of the variation is expected per the document.

> **Response 2:** I was last employed by a company that only saw Medicare pts. My supervisors said it was fine to do this as long as you document why (illness, vacation, family emergency etc).

Are 'free phone consultations ' or 'discovery calls' a great way to get new clients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a client I am deterred by someone that won’t show their prices and you must schedule a discovery call to find out.  I don’t want to waste my time. But having discovery calls available is good.

> **Response 2:** It’s a better way to screen the client and make sure they are actually a good fit for you and your clinic.

How are you getting your referrals? Marketing ideas? i’ve gone to different Primary MDs, Home Health agencies? Maybe i’m missing something because we’re struggling with getting referrals. I have a hybrid business model offering PT and OT with specialty for wound care and lymphedema. We take cash, Medicare, and BCBS. Located in Chicago.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Think outside your typical referral sources. Go straight to the consumers. Offer free workshops with support groups, libraries, gyms, etc. Teach basic anatomy and give them a taste of why they would want to work with you. Just ask for name and email to start your own distribution list.

> **Response 2:** I tried marketing to the same for awhile my 1st year in practice and got no where. But keep at it. Within the last 6 months I've had 2 doctors start referring to me regularly. It helped that the patients I saw from them gave me raving reviews during their followups, so they started sending more to me. My business coach also says it takes 12+ 'touches' to make someone interested and purchase from you, so just have to keep consistent with it. Most of my referrals come from word of mouth, previous patients, friends and family. Just starting to get some more from Google and my website.

**Original Post:**
Hi again,
Anyone have a template of email that they use to ask for Google Review?
Specific context: I am independent contractor in a clinic that does a lot or perinatal physiotherapy. I treat ortho and pelvic health of all genders. My colleague specializes in perinatal and does labour and delivery prep and post partum recovery. When we discharge a client, the admin says something like "would you consider leaving us a review?". and if they client says no problem, they get an email with reminder/link.
Almost all her clients leave her reviews but barely any leave for me. I am not sure if its because of the wording of the email. Or the fact that her patients don't (come for and therefore dont do rehab that is to ) heal from pain and dysfunction. , so they just mention that it was great experience etc. Whereas with me, they come with a problem and they get better and maybe they had expectations to be quicker or something so by the time they disharge, they arent as satisfied? not sure if its my imposter syndrome. So basically, any thoughts?
or templates?
Id like to build up my name there but if the reviews only mention my colleague. I also want people of all genders to know they are welcome but if you only see pregnancy reviews, can throw people off...
if you read until now, Thanks so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have your clinic ask them after they've seen you for a few sessions and you've built rapport and starting to see progress.  No need to wait to DC, and oftentimes by that point they've already "moved on" and it's hard/ uncomfortable to hound them to write it. 

When I email my pts asking them about leaving a review I start with something like "it's been such a pleasure working with you and I'm so glad  you reported you can now lift your toddler painfree and run 2 miles without leaking, what great improvements! Id love to be able to help  other moms (insert population here) like you get the help they need. Would you be willing to leave a review so they know help is out there?" If they agree, I give them a guideline like:  "please include
why you sought PT, what issues were you dealing with and what functional limitations did you have, what has changed/ improved since you started?" 

Don't secondguess your skills! You know you can help them and you see them improving on the daily- own it!!

> **Response 2:** Why don’t you ask them personally? Start with clients you feel really comfortable with and work from there. I’m an independent contractor for a mobile practice so there is no admin to do this for us!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on the payers. Usually you bill under your group though. But you can always enroll with your individual NPI later if needed, so use the group for now so you can get set up.

> **Response 2:** Always think with the end in mind. Do you want to be solo forever? Or eventually hire and help more people? Group it is my friend. 😃😃😃

I am moving states and probably losing all my yelp and google reviews.  Would it be inappropriate or annoying once I reopen to reach back out to the people who posted. I’ve saved them to help make it easy if they want to cut and paste. Or do I just deal with it and start over with fresh reviews  Ego vs Ethics but is it unethical? Part of business?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Right now I have a link to yelp and google but it will change with the move.  I don’t believe they transfer states even if same business.  🤷‍♀️ May mark those locations as closed   I can add them to my website but the goal is to get them to find me through yelp and google.

> **Response 2:** Moving your google business is a pain in the rear end but can be done! I spent hours with a specialist last week (we just moved locations) and they were able to help me out slowly but surely. Our grand opening is on Wednesday so I did give them that deadline which I feel helped speed up the process.

Illinois PT Practice Act/Direct Access Question 

This has come up a couple of times in the last few months, and I just want to make sure I'm correct. 

It's my understanding of the Practice Act that I have 5 business days to notify a “treating healthcare professional”, chosen by the patient, that we have started PT without a referral. 

Twice, I've had prospective patients state that they've seen a PT via direct access without notifying a “treating healthcare professional”. This doesn't seem correct based on my reading of the Practice Act. 

Any feedback from the group would be really helpful.

https://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/068/068013400000850R.html

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The text confuses me more a little. For the patient that doesn't not have a physician, is this saying that you just need to offer to notify? And what do you do if they do not have a physician, many with a PPO plan do not

> **Response 2:** In Illinois that just means you have to fax the plan of care to a physician.  If they don't have a current physician we just ask them who the last physician was that they saw and we send it to them.

We are in a sublease renting a room inside of a gym. We have an employee who needs a private area for lactation breaks. Since we are renting one big room, we do not have a private area for her breaks.

Has any one else been in a similar situation? Any guidance is appreciated!

Question for anyone running facebook ads: Looking into facebook ads but a bit worried about the HIPAA aspect of their tracking. If you link to a landing page/website, it looks like you have to use their meta pixel to track that data. Is there any way to keep this HIPAA compliant? Do you use a different company for tracking? Is there any resources that anyone has with some information into starting this up?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Derek. Yes, you can keep things HIPAA compliant if you're careful you're not sending PHI back to Facebook when tracking conversions or custom events.

Cash-pay clinicians practicing in states with restricted direct access- how do you overcome the barrier of a referral being required to work with patients? Do you do wellness sessions? Do you require patients to get a PT prescription in order to work with you? 

I've gotten mixed replies to this - do you even need a prescription if you're cash pay? 

I have not been practicing long enough to have a direct access license and am hoping to start a cash pay side gig in PA. Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Always refer to your state practice act… don’t know PA but insurance alone wouldn’t be a reason to determine allowance for direct access. It is always tied back to the practice act… 

The only time insurance plays a part is if they require a referral for coverage (or signed plan of care-Medicare).

If I can’t get a referral from the patient’s PCP, I used a telehealth platform where I know I can get one.

> **Response 2:** Direct access should only matter if you're working with insurance. Is your only accepting cash who cares if they have a referral...?

Is anyone selling workout programming with text/email feedback?

>>> What have you learned the hard way?  Tips for anyone starting out?  <<<

I’m offering rehab/fitness programming for folks who aren’t ready for general workouts - ex. chronic back pain, EDS, complex post-surgical etc.  As such, it will all be more customized than the typical workout program.  Videos for each exercise on an App. 

I’m starting with 1 client — she’ll also be doing Telehealth 1x/month.  So I’m fine doing some trial and error with her.  

I don’t have a solid grasp on the time expenditure yet so figuring out my time cost is challenging.  Some personal trainers I’ve asked suggested $200-300 for 4 weeks of programming.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Rubski Fenn …since you’re trying to figure out another income stream 😉 read the thread…

> **Response 2:** Hey chat with Joe Camoratto. He helped me tremendously walk though a new set up but also troubleshoot my next “thing” or opportunities

I use Google for business as my email provider, and my understanding is that this is HIPAA-compliant if you have signed the BAA (which I have). I had a referring provider ask me for my encrypted email address in order to send referrals (since I don't have a fax number - never got one since most of my patients come direct access, very few MD referrals). Does anyone know whether Google business with BAA is enough HIPAA protection for receiving referrals, or there is another layer of encryption that can be set up?
Thanks so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I thought that was sufficient enough and never had anyone question it… regardless if you want a cheap fax service you could use faxage ($7/month) if some providers you use are being a little extra cautious

> **Response 2:** I use paubox with my gmail it will encrypt your emails and is hippa compliant. Srfax is a cheap fax service as well

For those who are mobile, can you treat Medicare patient at a different location (e.g. a gym) but still bill code 12 - Home?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is an ongoing topic but to me 11 is office.... This mobile . 12 is home... Thus for home health PT ( not mobile). I have only  billed 11 and see clients where ever they want

> **Response 2:** 12 is for mobile outpatient providers. 11 is for your office registered with your MAC. Medicare doesn't cover therapy provided in community settings like a library or gym but if you have a lease with the gym and it's your office you'd use 11. If you see clients in their home at an ALF it's still 12.

Is Pickleball a good way to meet people and potential patients? I’m a beginner in the sport

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If your niche plays pickleball, yes. If they don't, no.

> **Response 2:** I definitely wouldn’t use it solely to meet potential patients. Relationships that happen organically tend to lead to better connections in terms of patients. I’m a competitive powerlifter and I work out in a specialized gym for that, have for about 3 years now. I’ve never been shy about what I do for a living but I’ve never handed out a business card. So now my coach knows me and trusts me, and sends me his athletes when they need care. I never forced anything, and never intended to. It happened organically.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** In most cases you really can’t. 

If you have an NPI it is part of the public record. Then cross reference that with property tax records and other public directories and your info is pretty much everywhere. 

You can pay for cyber security services to monitor suspicious activity, but you really can’t stay private and be in business.

**Original Post:**
Hi there guys. I was hoping you could give me some guidance here. 
So my current business plan is mobile PT for Medicare and cash with a niche in Geriatrics and eventually with fitness athletes. My cash rate would be $175/visit. 

However, I have a friend engaged to a dentist, and the dentist knows a concierge doctor, an internist, in a very affluent area about an hour away from me. 
It sounds like that concierge doctor would be interested in having a mobile PT for some of his patients. 

So, if this opportunity becomes a reality, I would be driving an hour to see some pretty wealthy people. I'm told that this doctor charges $150k a year just to be your doctor, labs and tests cost extra. 

I have not talked to the doctor yet about this, but I met him briefly several months ago at a birthday party. The dentist texted him last night to see if he would be interested and the doc responded "sure."

How would you approach this? What questions would you have?  Would you charge a higher rate (obviously would need to just for the commute)?  Would you offer a true "concierge" service where they pay monthly or yearly for say 1 or 2 visits a week, or just take referrals as they come for a specific plan of care? 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would hire a therapist in that area as I don't want to drive 2 hrs round trip

> **Response 2:** I would not want to go Concierge for a fee and be obligated to them for service. Life happens and if for some reason you can't continue treatment then what? Also do you have special skills for TMJ or anything of that nature that the dentist would find advantageous to his practice? Have you studied and trained in cranial sacral therapy?

I’m getting things ready to start my own practice. What should I use to build a website? I would like the ability to purchase sessions online since I do virtual sessions as well as in person and might make courses and such. I’m hoping to do this myself. I was thinking Wordpress… thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve literally used them all and have feedback here but… 

If you’re just starting, trust me, this is not your first step or where you want to put alll your attention. I did that and it was a mistake. 

Just create a simple landing page on any landing page biulder with a booking form for clients to work with you and focus on other things, you will have a beautiful website in the future 🙂 

I personally settled on Kajabi but wouldn’t recommend it for most people. 

I’d use something like GoHighLevel (all inclusive with your email) or a simple platform with just landing pages like Wix. 

Honestly you can start with just a Convert Kit opt in landing page that says “coming soon contact me here” and call it a day for now. 

WordPress is not simple, if you’re set on it or have some tech background, use the thrive themes plug ins. That wasent super challenging at all and you can grow with the plug in options over time. 

Yes, it’s the best because it’s yours when you biuld it. But becoming a website designer is just not a great use of time.

> **Response 2:** I really like GoDaddy and it's easy to use. I linked it to my Hushmail account pretty easily. I partner with a massage therapist who uses AcuitySchedule through their website to schedule and take payments.

**Original Post:**
Was asked to do a training on injury prevention for personal trainers who work at my local gym.  How do I price this?

This is a small gym and the owners (who are trainers) already refer to me.  This would add referrals as their new trainers would get to know me, so it’s a great thing for me to do for outreach, but I also don’t want to undervalue my time.  It’ll be an hour presentation and about 2 hours prep.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it’s important to understand that the largest payoff one could have from a workshop is clients signing up. If you get good at this, you can convert up to 40-60% of attendees into evaluations. The point is definitely not to make money on the front end, but to invest your time to serve the community with a much larger financial return on the backend. IMHO I think it’s very poor advice above to charge a high dollar amount for a workshop that is designed to: a) serve the community and b) convert clients to paid clients (which is where you can truly help someone and change their life). Remember: No one’s life truly gets changed from attending one workshop. When they decide to take action and take care of their problem for good is where the magic happens. 

Free or a nominal fee per person. And if you charge a nominal fee per person ($15-$50 per person), I even recommend giving 100% to the gym or the location that let you do the workshop.

Givers gain.

> **Response 2:** There has to be some type of price so they understand your worth. And then if they want to barter some thing else, I would go for what they offer in the negotiation￼

Any chance the admins of this group could start blocking spammy posts?  People are replying multiple times on the same posts to get us into their long term investments groups.  It’s fine to offer it once or twice, but it’s getting pretty ridiculous.  (They will probably reply to this post as well, lol).  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks you guys!  I appreciate your diligence. I didn’t realize I could flag it, so I’ll start doing that if I see em!

> **Response 2:** There are spammers like that in every group unfortunately. Easiest thing to do is hit report to admins so that they can be blocked. Some groups will put keywords as flags too in order to keep some of them from ever being seen by the group at large, but it’s a PITA keeping scammers out of popular groups sadly.

I'm considering starting my own practice. Torn for many reasons. Unfortunately, small town and I would need to be in network with some insurances. Does anyone know if there is anything wrong with getting in network with insurances and then not billing them, if I end up not going out on my own?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started in a town 5 yrs ago , population of 5 thousand, now close to 7 thousand. I have been able to create an amazing network and created enough impact to be able to hire my first full-time employee! I linked up with a group of passionate massage therapist first then slowly added to our group.

We strictly cash-based, no insurance. My advice: hire a coach. You can do it!!!

> **Response 2:** If you are in network with an insurance company you can’t charge people with that insurance for anything insurance covers.

UNCAGED CLINICIAN Success Council members Laura McKaig, Lesli Jenkins, Charlotte Walters, Lindsay Rush, Phil Finemore, James Connelly, Jordan Fred, and Lianne Rogers all joined Kevin DeGroot in Denver, CO over the weekend for "Working Weekend" where they all busted out some systems for their businesses on GoHighLevel!

Anyone have any good advice/tips for making posts to local community Facebook pages? I'm looking to take my Mobile Med B side hustle to full time, trying to get more community outreach. I've gotten a good amount of likes on my posts, but it's not converting at the rate I'd like to getting more patients. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Local groups are great for building "famousity"! So be present in the groups. A lot.

Respond to people's posts, even if it has nothing to do with you.

Recommend services that you don't offer, but trust and feel confident recommending.

Connect with the other regular posters who share part of your vision; become their friend.

Pay attention to the most frequently asked questions that are relevant to you -- the questions can become content for you (digital or workshops or both), and the people asking can become people you offer free resources and information to, until they're ready to have you solve a problem they have.

If there's a "small business posting" day, use it.

If there are networking events advertised, try them.

> **Response 2:** I posted a video of me introducing myself and my new business in a local FB group when I was just starting and it actually worked well! I think I got at least like 8-10 people contact me and 3-4 new patients schedule, which felt like a win to me!

What do you say to an established patient who is scheduled for surgery and expects you to be available for them; the patient will be out for an unknown amount of time…but you have a waitlist and can’t hold their spot. (Not ready to hire yet)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm a solo provider/therapist. I have found that all of my clients want me to take time off...unless it interferes with their care 🤣. I tend to straddle a weekend for my time off, so that I have spots for my post-surgical clients before and after my time off. I also prioritize returning clients over new referrals. I would love to hire someone to fill in for my time off, but we have a huge PT shortage in my rural community.

> **Response 2:** I hired someone to just fill in while I was out. Not a consistent employee. 
It was very helpful.

Has anyone done this and what do you do about the referral and POC?

Thank you so much for your help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So long as the patient has a relationship with their doctor and seen them in the last year…You can call most doctors and get a verbal immediately. Hellonote has a nice request order button that faxes a request

> **Response 2:** I use documo to fax plans of care to doctors and haven’t had any issue with that. Often if patients haven’t seen a specialist or gotten a referral, they at least have a PCP who will sign off on the POC

I finally pulled the trigger and got an LLC for my mobile/gym based cash PT clinic in Gainesville, Florida.  This is definitely just a side source of income and nothing full time as I also have to juggle a lot of family demands. I want to make sure I have all the administrative steps checked before I start seeing patients.  Does anyone know if I need to register with the Florida Physical Therapy Board and the City of Gainesville?  My online search is not yielding any answers, so I am assuming no.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in Orlando Florida and I had to register my business with the county and get a local business tax receipt. I'm not sure if that applies to where you are but I would double check. Also for the state of  Florida you register as a clinic with a health care clinic exemption

> **Response 2:** Hi! I’m an OT who specializes in Barnes Myofascial Release and Pelvic Health. I have a solo practice called Zest Myofascial Release in Jacksonville Beach. I have a couple clients who drive from Gainesville to see me. I’d love to connect with you, as I don’t have a gym & focus more on somatics/mind-body treatment than exercise, but would love know someone I can refer to for this in Gainesville.

Definitely register your LLC with Sunbiz (the Florida State division of corporations) as well as your city.

Website design. When purchasing a domain name say through Squarespace or godsddy- can this domain name then be used to create a webpage through any company or graphic designer. I don’t plan to create a webpage right away but would like to reserve the domain; I want to purchase now but not be locked into that company.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, you can purchase a domain name anywhere and use it with any company later. I also recommend name cheap. I definitely do not recommend going through GoDaddy or bluehost. Hostinger is what I personally recommend to clients for hosting your website if on WordPress and It's great for purchasing domains as well.

> **Response 2:** Be careful you own name and website when you build it. Sometimes the rights are retained by developer and if you leave them you start over.

How does everyone feel about SEO companies? Worth paying for or no?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Well, it depends on the company! We had a therapist who has been paying around $200 a month for almost 3 years who had our digital marketing expert do a review and found out nothing was being done for SEO. CRAZY!

> **Response 2:** Depends on what your goal is. I do SEO and personally prefer to either teach (1:1 or course) an owner how to effectively manage it themselves OR overhaul their SEO then teach them how to maintain. I do monthly contracts but usually only recommend those to clients who have no interest or time doing it themselves or who need more intricate ongoing work.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a mobile provider, I use Google Voice and it rings on my personal phone so I don’t have two different phones. I only pay like $10/month more for it and really helps to separate personal from business. Hope that helps!

Hello!  I'm an OT, CHT and I love following these posts and getting more information on the uncaged clinician life.  One hold up I keep having is where can you get reliable information about direct access care for your state, specifically Georgia?  If you plan to be cash based only, but you're still advertising as OT services, do you need to have direct access?  What are the limitations on this or where can you direct me to more information on the regulations?  Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Ashley, I just sent an email to the Georgia OT assoc with this question. OT’s in Georgia do have direct access. If you are cash based you only need to have the training to back up your competency in what you are treating. If accepting insurance it depends on what each insurance company requirements are.

> **Response 2:** Hey Ashley, I am an OT with my own practice.  If you do want to see Medicare clients, just be sure you are familiar with the rules/regulations we need to follow for that population.

Has anyone ever started a concierge/mobile cash PT business with someone else but had separate LLC’s? My friend and I were hoping to have a business name together (shared website, marketing, etc) but keep our money and taxes separate? Any advice or recommendations on how to go about this or if this is possible?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance - Missing in the equation are legal obligations of a practice related to the website itself, as well as specific notices that practice will be obligated to post.....  

Get legal advice of a health law attorney in your state... that can address all your questions, including website legal obligations.

> **Response 2:** I would keep your businesses separate. 

A website that features both of you could be ok as a marketing collaborative (a website that features multiple businesses) 

But honestly. I would decide what will happen (who will own it) if anything happens to the partnership later.

WHY IS SEO IMPORTANT FOR YOUR BUSINESS?

I have to be honest, I used to be one of those people that never really trusted SEO or thought it was a scam, merely due to the fact that I didn't know what it actually was. But after going down the SEO rabbit hole, learning all the ins and outs, and now offering it as a service at Nogn, I've realized just how crucial it is for businesses.

But here are a few top reasons:
* Increased traffic from ORGANIC searches
* Best tool for local businesses to get seen - utilize Google My Business
* Builds Brand Authority - creates trust and credibility for your business
* Cost Effective Solution - relatively cheap compared to other marketing tactics
* Strong Long Term Strategy - more effective than PPC ads

You can read through the full blog on why SEO is important here: https://www.nognstudio.com/blog/why-seo-is-important-for-businesses 

Hope this helps clarify the reasoning for SEO campaigns, feel free to hit me up with any questions you have!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I know WHY it is important……I just don’t know HOW to do it 😩 Whenever I read something, it’s like a foreign language to me

Does anyone here struggle with getting their leads to convert to an evaluation once they have expressed interest in your services (or opted in to an ad)?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Facebook Ads? 

Are the leads for sure from ideal clients or are they snoopy people clicking on ads out of curiosity.

Looking to get myself and my clinic out into the community and set up a table at a local town fair. What are some things that you guys do that bring people in at these events? I obviously don’t want to do a whole ortho assessment bc it’s a waste of mine and their time. Not exactly sure how I can sell myself to a random person at one of these event.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t think about selling yourself. Think about events like blind dates. If you sell yourself hard it can be off putting. 

Be nice. Talk to people about where they’re at what their problems are. Make it about them. 

Offer how you can help them but don’t be pushy. Get contact info, get them to follow your insta etc…

> **Response 2:** I’ve done cupping and scraping before at health fairs which has brought in new patients… most of them didn’t know I did these kinds of things… I always go in with a goal of how many new patients I want to get out of the event to make sure I’m very intentional with it!

Has anyone done coaching?
 I have a client that reached out to me; I  could facilitate from a coaching aspect; but afraid to cross boundaries...but I  see coaches recommend things that a professional has done and recommended. This line is very blurry to me. Can y'all help me clarify, What the difference is between a coach and a therapist...(I know in my practice but what the view from the outside world and if you do both how do you differentiate.??? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Really look at the difference between therapeutic exercise and general exercise…. There is very little to no difference. It’s all on a spectrum. I think it’s a shame that therapists get overshadowed by trainers but it’s because we as a profession lack confidence. You can and should coach. But also know school probably didn’t prepare you for program design. Joe Camoratto covers that pretty well too.

> **Response 2:** If a strength coach or personal trainer could make the program you’re making, it’s not skilled. I’ve coached close to 100 athletes remotely and have no formal personal training or strength coaching education outside of self education

Hey ya’ll! I’m meeting with a gym owner next week to brainstorm some ways we can partner together. We both have new businesses and an interest in working with moms and actually met through the local stroller champions group (that she started). Neither of us are fully committed to that niche though and do enjoy working with everyone to promote overall health and wellness. I have some pelvic health experience (looking to grow in this area as well), but not specifically certified at this point. If you work with a local gym OR moms specifically, what are some things that you’ve found to helpful in your community and to grow your business?

ETA: Specifically looking for workshop/seminar/event type ideas that you’ve had personal experience with.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve done some events for moms! I try to make it super relaxed (moms and mimosas) to help foster an inviting environment where moms can talk, collaborate and not feel so alone in their physical and mental struggles of motherhood.

> **Response 2:** The remote strength world is a great spot for busy moms to get back into strength training with whatever they have available at home

Hi out there! I've been absent from this group but ready to come back. I moved from CA to PA in Sept and upended my life in so many ways. I decided to open my own mobile PT practice and also focus on writing and art. Well, after what I felt was a lot of outreach and networking and advertising locally I've only gotten one patient. Now I see her 2-3 x most weeks so she's a great patient to have! I think the universe knew I wanted to focus on my writing and I really haven't put any energy into the business but am ready to try again. I am a little discouraged however. I put a lot of time into an online free balance class I thought would be a good entry into my business with no success. I became a Medicare Part B provider even though I don't want to deal with insurance, would really like to be cash based, because I'm trying to focus on fall prevention and promoting independence in the elderly and figured I should do it. Any words of wisdom or suggestions out there? I'm not all that comfortable in front of groups so hesitate to do a class or presentation in front of a large group...plus fall prevention in a group...can't really have them do too much without huge liability issues...though I am prepared to do something if I need to. Guess I'm just looking for any words of wisdom, advice, or encouragement any of you who have read this far can offer. Thanks!

Hi everyone! I live in a popular tourist town during the summer and I was wondering if anyone had ever reached out to AirBnB owners about marketing services to the people who rent out their properties? I primarily see active older adults and was wondering if this would even be a good strategy or if people wouldn’t really care

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ooh, interesting idea! 
I’m in a tourist town too. Lots of people come here with money to burn each summer. 

I think it would be worth a shot, especially if you were willing to do reciprocal marketing on your socials. 

Always think about how you can exchange value when you’re going to ask for something. If any of the rental house owners are already your clients, that would be an easy ask… but otherwise, think of how it helps them. 

I wouldn’t hit every rental, but find the ones that also cater to your target audience, or homes that are in areas that may attract those people.

> **Response 2:** Airbnb offer experiences, I think even fitness recently

**Original Post:**
I got a patient (and husband) who both come once a month. One cash, one BCBS (but has 14k deductible so kind of cash).

I have a wait area, a gym area, and a private room (where most of my sessions are). They usually book first or second schedule. I usually have a 15 min break in between sessions to set up my room, go to the bathroom, breath. If first session, I arrive 10 min early to do same (I usually am exhausted by end of day and tend not to fully clean before I go home. Prefer to do it next mornings). 

They have the most annoying habit of arriving early and barging into my room vs waiting in the waitroom. I have started locking the wait area access to gym, but they will knock it and go to the glass door to the gym (and emergency door out, not usually open) and knock… because I don’t have a receptionist and they are “afraid I am not there”. 🙄. I even added a sign: please be seated, your therapist will be with you. 

Any suggestions? 

Ps: they are snarky with other things (like asking why I did not clean on the day before if they are first ones, or whining other PT never charged copay even when she did not meet deductible, and other little silly things.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Let them knock. Don't reward their inappropriate behavior. If it's a glass door, give them the "one second" finger gesture, and leave them alone until you are ready.

> **Response 2:** Establish boundaries. 
Tell them you appreciate their promptness but their sessions starts at (stated time). 
I also agree with the statement above that this might not be your client. You have a choice just like they do for services. Stand up for yourself and let the pieces fall where they may. 

Good luck!

Anyone have google voice linked to their phone and can help me? When a new client would call it would show as a google voice call, cueing me in that it was business related and not my personal calls, but now it rings the same as my personal phone without telling me it’s Google voice caller. Any way to change this?

**Community Responses:**

My first IDEAL client came from a word of mouth referral from my old boss.

I have gotten a few new clients from MD referrals, but this took a crazy amount of time and I do not rely on it.

Hope this inspires all of you to promote your business and your work in the world and stop playing small. 

Be brave and allow your amazing self to BE SEEN! ❤️

Story time: 🤓

I was looking to grow my social media followers for my physical therapy business. 

So I decided to send a message to all my friends and relatives asking them to follow my account and share with their circle to follow it. 

I was transparent about wanting more followers. (Because authenticity and transparency are my core values. We all live by our core values. Most people just have no awareness of what their core values are.) 

I woke up to more than 30 new followers from across the world (USA, India, Canada, UK, Africa etc) in less than 24 hours. 

And I know the list of followers is going to grow because my business information has been passed on so many times by my loved ones and well wishers. 

I was surprised (shocked actually 😱) to see who all didn’t follow me until now including my immediate family members and a few extremely close friends who I assumed were following me. 😃🤷🏻‍♀️

❤️❤️❤️ The moral of the story: ❤️❤️❤️

Be Brave. 

You have to ask for what you want.

You have to ask for what you need. 

Don’t assume people will know what to do just because they love you or are family. 

You have to be clear on your expectations and communicate them clearly. 

You can’t get upset with people for not reading your mind. 

You have to get out of your own way. 

Stop overthinking and just go get what you need. 

People are more open and understanding than you give them credit for. 

Stop allowing your biases to limit your growth. 

Much love,
Tulsi ❤️ 

PS: 

If you have been thinking about working with me one day, don’t sit on the fence forever overthinking everything. Send me a message 📱and let’s get the conversation started. 

I will be honest and transparent in my suggestions for you. 

PSS: 

I am asking all of you to follow my business pages as well. (Why not? 😉) 

Here are the links:

*"From the core of who I am"*

*"God placed this mission in my heart."*

*"I do what I do because I see the potential in other people."*

*"To provide hope, because the world is filled with brokenness."*

*"To be a pillar of hope."*

*"To build something that serves the community and to move beyond myself."*

As Kevin DeGroot, Josh Payne, Kalyca Jin Zarich, and I have held board meetings with our mastermind students over the past two weeks, these are some of the amazing comments that these incredible people have stated when asked:

*Why do you do what you do?*

*Why is that important?*

We also ask them to rate how they are doing in the areas of the 5 F's:

*Faith *

*Family *

*Fitness *

*Finance *

*Fulfillment*

And what is interesting is that no one's level of fulfillment has been tied to their finance rating.

Perhaps because your business or your job should exist for you; not you existing for your job.

Maybe it is because, virtually, we have never had a student or prospective student tell us that they wanted to create their own practice in order to make more money.

Yes, making more money does happen to be a reason.  But it is never the first thing a person says.  It is usually at least 4th or 5th on their reason list.

In fact, one student even commented that:

*"Unless you are happy at your core, you will never be happy in your business."*

The 5 F's represent your core.

*So, I ask:*

*What is your Why? *

We would love to know.

Furthermore,* does your current vehicle *(i.e. your practice or your job)* have the ability to take you to where you want to be?*

If it needs to change, comment *"**vehicle**" *below 👇 Perhaps we can help.

Costs very much depend on what is all needed etc usually started at $200-ish for a basic logo was the going rate in the Madison / Milwaukee metro area.

Hi all! I’m focused right now on trying to increase my word of mouth referrals, and my husband suggested that I run a promotion offering a referral credit to existing patients who refer a friend or family member (like a $10 credit to their next visit, or something like that). I’m wondering:
(A) Has anyone done this and did you find it successful?
(B) Are there any legal or HIPAA issues with this? The referred patient would just have to mention the friend who referred them when setting up their appointment or in their intake paperwork. 

Thanks for the input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you accept insurance, I have been told that this constitutes enticement which can be illegal if the patient has a government insurance. However, if you are a cash pay clinic, I don’t see why you couldn’t do this. 

That said, I do offer a referral bonus to employees.

> **Response 2:** I hand out t shirts galore. I see them around town. They cost me $9 each

Hit me with your recommendations for insurance coverage for yourself, your business an any add ons you have. I am actively getting quotes as my business model is changing a bit and I currently have CM&F but they do not cover a key item I will need covered. So I am not sure if I want to stay with them for all but that item and get that through some other company of od I can find a company to cover it all. 

My needs are the following:
* Solo practioner under LLC
* Mobile practice 
* Hybrid PT + Wellness model
* Telehealth PT
* In person fitness instruction 
* Live virtual fitness classes 
* Recorded on-demand classes 
* Non-contact boxing fitness 
* In person educational workshops/courses
* Online educational workshops/courses

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Also does everyone provide wellness and fitness under their Professional Liability as a PT or so they add on the fitness instruction option?

> **Response 2:** What does CM&F not cover?

Does anyone want to share what kind of discounts or free treatments you give for things like referrals, testimonials, etc. I mainly do dry needling and manual work. Something like if a person puts in a review I give them a discounted treatment, or a referral that completes “x” amount of sessions gets a free electro dry needling treatment?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We send a handwritten thank you note and $50 Amazon gift card for word of mouth referrals (for non-healthcare providers - if it’s another professional we send them a handwritten note only, no gifts) and to patients who leave a Google Review we send a handwritten thank you card. 

We do offer a free session for client testimonial videos that we use on our YouTube channel (not Google Reviews) - we book the normal 60-min session and record the testimonial video at the beginning (takes 10-20 min, depending on how prepared they are or how much they want to share) and any leftover time the patient gets free care. They love it and it feels good to give them something for their time.

> **Response 2:** I don’t like to discount or give away free things for reviews. I just email them after the session and if they have a good experience they will leave a message. 
I do every once in a while host giveaways for a free session once in a blue moon on social media to drum up engagement

You've probably seen emails and posts regarding the ***UNCAGED CLINICIAN Launchpad*** program.

If so, we know that we've given a general overview of what the 10-week program entails.

Over the next few days we want to break it down for you even more to help you decide if Launchpad is right for you.

Week 1 is an introduction into leadership and business. We want to help you to establish the building blocks that create a solid foundation for your marketing. In other words, the little things that help to make marketing simpler.

Week 2 expands upon week 1 for creating a solid marketing foundation.

Here's the good news: you will hear more about marketing throughout the course. Why? Because a solid marketing strategy is a whole lot more than stopping by doctor's offices or running a Facebook ad.

Those things are side dishes. We want to give you the meat to marketing.

If you already know that our Launchpad is the right choice for you, sign up and get started today! (Link in Comments)

Have questions? Schedule a call with us. (Link in Comments)

Simple Practice EMR users - How are you getting physician signatures on your POC documents?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We just fax them. Unfortunately other EMRs that are much more expensive have issues with their system faxes as well. We were paying so much before and really the only part we could use was the incoming fax box it wouldn’t notify you if fax did not go through so that was a wasted feature and a huge frustration.

> **Response 2:** For doctors who have hippa compliant emails and are willing to e-sign, there is a very easy way to send the POC for signature right from the patient profile. But for the 90% of practices that want things faxed for signature... I couldn't find a good way. And their support staff were less than helpful... I ended up making a custom POC template with a signature/certification area and then I use a third party e-fax service. Less than ideal. If anybody knows a better way I'd love to hear it!

Anyone have advice on what to charge for a 2-3 hour educational course for a small group (3 personal trainers). I had a community personal trainer reach out to me asking if I could do some sort of presentation on safe lifting techniques and mechanics after coming back from an injury. Not sure what a fair price would be. Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Might be an unpopular opinion, but do it for free. Working alongside personal trainers can be a great source for generating referrals. I see it as a 1 time charge for the course, versus a long term relationship with the trainers. The revenue generated from one client referred to you by a personal trainer from will likely exceed the amount you’d charge for the course. Work the angle of how you can benefit their clients if they experience pain and/or restrictions in their lifting technique, and share clients this way. Food for thought 👍

Hey all,

For those who have walked into MD offices to market, do you typically talk to front desk only? Do you ask to meet the doctor? What is your usual approach to this? So far I have talked to front desk twice and discussed things with them. Most recently the doctor was sitting at the front so i got lucky and was able to meet him. Hoping I get my first patient sooner rather than later!

Can you explain the process of when a client comes to see you as a wellness client verses for traditional physical therapy services? Is the paperwork the same? What is the criteria for someone qualifying for wellness vs. PT, is billing different etc?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ditto to what Jessica said. A lot of our rehab patients end up continuing services with us as wellness clients to continue to work on strength training, health coaching, whatever they want. I've had wellness clients stay on 2-5x a wk for over a year after discharge from therapy. They love it and they often end up spreading the word about the business to their friends and family.

> **Response 2:** I have them sign a general waiver that also states that services are not PT or medical treatment (I had an attorney draft this up). There are no notes so paperwork is minimal. I do an intake similar to a trainer to see problem areas and know if there are any issues I need to be aware of. My billing is a flat price per visit and visits are as needed. Many clients are post PT or wanting to prevent issues etc 

Main differential is I’m NOT offering PT so not evaluating or diagnosing

I need some real sound business advice. I treat patients at a gym that I partner with. This gym will have summer camp soon and will host 300-400 students during the summer. They have a trainer that does agility, strength, speed, etc with them. I need some ideas that I can market to these middle school and high school students that will bring some serious value. Any ideas?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Reflex performance reset. It’s mind blowing and totally suited for athletes.

> **Response 2:** Agility, strength, speed are unfortunately the big things these athletes need to be worrying about. Max lifts, 40 speed, triple hop distance, long jump, vertical, cone drill, etc. Maybe find some objective test like those that the personal trainer isn’t doing and fill in the gaps. Or perhaps focus on mobility. Most high level athletes tend to have at least above average mobility.

Looking for opinions: 

I have been treating a patient post MVA. The daughter of the patient was unfortunately recently involved in a separate car accident. The daughter wanted an ortho recommendation, so I provided the name of a local ortho who I met with a few months back in hopes of starting a referral relationship. After her initial visit, they put the patient in touch with a chiropractor. Feeling a bit slighted here and want to reach out to them but want to respect their clinical judgement.

Thoughts????

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 100% follow up with patient and follow up with ortho. Would tell them how you referred said patient over and that this is not how you would like a biz relationship to be. I would hands down ask them if they have any patients that may be a good fit for your practice

Also you might get patient back. This happened to me one time

> **Response 2:** What Joey said plus,do you have a referral process in place? Did you send to doc with a written referral from you? Call to let them know to look out for a patient you had referred? Call and set up the appointment from your office? Educated the patient that you would like them to return to you once seen by the doc? Scheduled the patient on your books and sent over the initial POC for signature if necessary and appropriate?  If not, you may want to formalize this process. Educate your patients so that they become your advocate. You want patients telling their doc that you sent them there and they want to go back to you when it's time for rehab.

Just for fun I thought I'd ask ChatGPT to come up with a sales pitch and a marketing plan for cash services. These are the results I got:

"Invest in your health today and experience the benefits of physical therapy with cash payment. By paying with cash, you save time and money as there's no need to go through insurance claim processes. This means you can get started on your physical therapy journey right away without any delays. Moreover, cash payment gives you more control over your physical therapy sessions as you can choose the frequency and length of each session. So, why wait? Invest in your well-being and make the most of your physical therapy experience by paying with cash."

Marketing Plan for Cash-Pay Physical Therapy Services

Target Market: Our target market is individuals who are seeking physical therapy services and have the financial resources to pay out of pocket. This could include individuals who do not have insurance, have high deductibles or out of pocket maximums, or do not want to go through the hassle of insurance claim submissions and pre-authorizations.

Unique Selling Proposition: Our unique selling proposition is that by paying cash, clients will have access to more personalized and comprehensive physical therapy services without the restrictions and limitations imposed by insurance. This includes a personalized treatment plan, longer appointment times, and a more hands-on approach to treatment.

Marketing Channel: Our marketing channels will include social media platforms, email marketing, and direct mail. We will also reach out to local gyms and fitness studios to build partnerships and offer promotions for their members.

Social Media Marketing: We will utilize social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to reach our target market and showcase our physical therapy services. We will post informative articles and videos about physical therapy, share testimonials from satisfied clients, and offer promotions for cash-pay services.

Email Marketing: We will create an email marketing campaign to reach out to past and current clients who have expressed interest in our physical therapy services. The email will highlight the benefits of cash-pay services, including personalized treatment plans, longer appointment times, and a more hands-on approach to treatment.

Direct Mail: We will create a direct mail campaign that targets individuals who live in the area and have recently been diagnosed with a condition that would benefit from physical therapy. The direct mail will highlight the benefits of cash-pay services and offer a special promotion for new clients.

Partnership with Local Gyms and Fitness Studios: We will reach out to local gyms and fitness studios to build partnerships and offer promotions for their members. We will provide informational flyers and posters to be displayed in the gym or studio, and offer a discount on cash-pay services for members who sign up.

Promotion: We will offer a special promotion for new clients who choose cash-pay services. This could include a discount on their first appointment or a complimentary consultation.

Measuring Success: We will measure the success of our marketing plan by tracking the number of new cash-pay clients, the growth of our email marketing list, and the number of social media followers. We will also track the success of our partnerships with local gyms and fitness studios by tracking the number of members who take advantage of our promotions.

Adjustments: Based on the results of our marketing plan, we will make adjustments as needed to ensure the success of our cash-pay physical therapy services. This could include adjusting our marketing channels, refining our promotions, or expanding our partnerships with local gyms and fitness studios.

**Original Post:**
How long is an OT outpatient referral good for? 30 days? One year? Help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Check your state practice act and see if they have a requirement. If not, it would probably be payer specific. If it’s Medicare, referral is not required, a signed POC IS.

> **Response 2:** You could also consider this state dependent. regardless if you see the patient and write a plan of care and get it signed by the physician I don’t think that matters too much. If that’s what you were talking about. ￼￼￼

Does anyone have experience with creating posts on google business profiles ? I have a plan in place that includes posts on google and it seems very touchy about rejecting posts for guidelines but I can never see what guidelines I violated for it to get rejected? Does anyone have specific experience with this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve never had problems with google business posts, but I’ll say Facebook was the worst with this when it came to their ads. Huge reason we moves away from FB. 
You can’t post anything or advertise anything that asks the use of they have a physical ailment: “do you have neck pain?”

Hi all! I’ve been a fly on the wall in this group for a week or two and the info is all so helpful!!

I’ve been in outpatient PT for 11 years, and PRN for the last 5. I’ve had the tug to open my own mobile, cash based practice for about a year now 🙈 and finally am brave enough to move forward 🥳

My LLC paperwork is filed and I have EMR set up but the NPI confuses me. It looks like I have an NPI1. Should I change the address of this from my current employer to myself? I will likely continue to work prn for them for a little while. Just not sure how to move forward there.

I would also LOVE to work with the Parkinson’s population as I am BIG certified and have a great referral source, but you all have made me aware that I will probably have to accept Medicare for that and I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet 😅😅😅

Anyways…THANK YOU for all the great content you all put in this group. It’s helped me so much already!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Anthony Maritato has a YouTube channel that covers lots of things, including the NPI question! 

He also has a Facebook group, Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group . I take Medicare because I also work with Parkinson's, and that group has been a wealth of information and help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just to make sure it's clear, I don't get paid for this. I just want to promote FCS because it really fixes things that no other technique can. It's charged how I view the body and how I treat. My practice never has to market because of the results we get for our clients. It's been 3 years since I've spent money on marketing. If the cost stresses you out - pull it from that part of the budget! DM me if you have questions. Would love to see some of you here with me in March!

I’ve searched the group and am piecing info together, but would love some direct advice. I am a PT, but left hospital based outpatient care a few years back and am functioning now as a mobile personal trainer. I have my own LLC. Over the years, I have had many clients and gyms who have reached out to me asking to provide physical therapy services. I’ve had to refer out or turn them down. Recently a gym offered me the option of leasing space from them, but in hopes I would be able to offer PT. I can figure out the logistics- I have the LLC. This would continue to be a cash based business. I would have the space to treat. Obviously consider costs of leasing. I already have liability insurance that covers me for PT and wellness. I would have a network for referrals. I can piece together the other legal aspects, forms, etc. But what other or big things am I not considering??

(And yes, I am interested in offering PT as part of my business. I have turned down enough opportunities over the years. This particular gym and owner align really with my business model.)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As Tom Conlon pointed out, you will need to check with both State and City to see if they require a "business license/permit".  This can vary state to state and city to city.  Yes, you will need to be able to provide people with superbills if they wish to submit OON for reimbursement.  Know this: Anyone who feels that you are their best option, and they decide that they want to pay for what they feel is the best option for them, has the right to do so

> **Response 2:** You will only be able to provide services for individuals who do not have Medicare, or become credentialed with Medicare. If people want to submit as OON, you will need to provide documentation for them to submit to their insurance

Hi uncaged crew, I’m going to talk to a CrossFit gym and discuss ways we can partner. I’m curious what recommended partnerships may look like. What should I avoid? Any recommended ways to make it mutually beneficial as a business? Any feedback would be great.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have my practice out of a crossfit gym and I have been hosting clinics each month focusing on specific body regions and am collaborating with the head coach on a 5 week clinic focusing on the oh squat and snatch. 
I joined the gym and am immersed in the community so I see what people need and then I find a way to help with that.

> **Response 2:** Agree with Scott Hopson. One of the best things you can do is immerse yourself in the community (the gym). Look for opportunities to SERVE the gym first. Resist the urge to immediately look to “take”. Also, build the relationship based on authenticity vs “referral fees”

Question: 
Would you put the trust of your bank account in the hands of social media comments and Google searches?

Did that question make you chuckle with the tone of "That's stupid"?

9 out of 10 people usually respond that way.

8 out of 10 new business owners actually do just that.

7 of those 8 struggle to make significant progress.

You don't have to struggle.

The UNCAGED Business Launchpad gives you the roadmap you need.

Not only does it provide you with directions, it offers you solutions for navigating roadblocks.... solutions that Google can't give.

Comment "LAUNCH" to find out how to get the roadmap.

Not sure of the best place to ask this, but lets start here! I'm working on starting my own business MADE NEW Physical Therapy and Wellness, but found out I'm pregnant with TWINS. This has delayed my capacity to work on the business as I am still full time at my current op Ortho job and DEAD by the end of the day. 

Wondering if there are any virtual positions I could apply for to give me time with the twins at home and some flexibility to continue seeing my Made New patients. Not really looking for a clinical reviewer position which I know are out there.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m due in august and plan to explore virtual services as I gradually return to work.  I wish I had started virtual sooner as being pregnant has made it a little harder to market and grow my in-person business, I’ve basically only been treating maintenance clients the past month 😬 
I think virtual and in-person will be a good blend when I return

> **Response 2:** Depending on your financial and healthcare benefits needs through this period, you could grow your biz with virtual services. If you plan to accept insurance in the future or need to develop billing, marketing, sales, or admin skills in order to learn and train your future staff, you could accept a VA position with another PT clinic in addition. Pay will be less per hour but you’ll be ready to rock and roll with those skills for your own biz when you are ready to start accepting more volume and see clients in person.

Has anyone just used a digital business card instead of the regular kind? We all have our phones on us these days, so it's a really easy way to "hand out" contact information.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Both. I have a "dot" that I used at CSM, networking events with other professionals. It's great because if info changes, you can update the profile without printing new cards. Plus, then you are already entered into their phone. I had our physical cards at health fairs.

> **Response 2:** I think that depends on what you’re using them for. I’ve got business cards at local doctor’s offices, gyms, the local running store, etc. (all of those places asked for them) - that’s not possible with a digital card. If you’re just giving it to your clients, I think it would potentially be fine.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Magazine and print like that has not worked for me where I am, in all honesty word-of-mouth has been best giving my pamphlets to clients to take to their doctors appointment with them talking about our programs etc. I guess it depends on what area you are.

I think this might help people understand the importance of a niche.   

My car (Nissan) was having issues so I decided to look for a mechanic.   During my search I found the following with good reviews: 

1. General mechanics who service all automobiles. 

2. Mechanics who specializes in servicing Nissans.  

Guess which mechanics I will be placing a call with? 

Happy Friday the 13th!

Those of you who service assisted living facilities: do they typically ask for proof of insurance? I have been seeing someone for 4 years in a facility and the new administrators have been extremely hostile toward me and are now asking for proof of insurance. I've never had a facility ask before. If it's normal, I'm ok with it but they've been so hostile I wanted to double check.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is an opportunity to build trust and credibility! 

Ask if you can meet with them, then ask how you can best support their needs and their residents and make it an easy “yes” for them. 

How can you prove to them you’re “safe” to have in the building? 

The new administrator may have had some bad experiences somewhere else. If I hadn’t been in this group and understood more about mobile practices, I would probably a little skeptical about a one-person PT “clinic” compared to a larger organization that feels like it would have more checks/balances/accountability. 

How do they know you won’t just skip town and become untraceable? Who is supervising you to make sure you’re legit? 
How do they know you’ll refer to a HH agency when appropriate instead of keeping them on your own caseload? 
(There are just thoughts they may have — I don’t need the answers.😆🫶) 

Good luck! 
Maybe you can win more referrals by being proactive!

Hi fellow clinicians,
I recently started my own LLC to have the option of treating on the side with the eventual goal to quit my full time gig and go rogue, like so many others of us in this group. But- I feel stuck. And I know I’d be more motivated if I had a partner. 

I’d love to connect with a like-minded (preferably physical therapist simply because I’m an OT and would love to offer an array of services) in Nashville area who would want to partner with me. Lots more details to discuss obviously, but if you or someone you know might be interested, please DM me. 

Happy Treating 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi I am also a Physical Therapist in Nashville. Feel free to message me!

> **Response 2:** No one will be able to DM you if you’re anonymous, just FYI 😊

Hi, I am just starting my practice on 1st September. 
Please share some ideas inform of some free workshops or pain assessment or what else I can offer to get visibility and people try the services? I am pelvic and ortho PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Get onto local mom groups if you are a pelvic PT! They may not allow advertisements, but a lot of people ask questions that you can answer and start to familiarize your community with who you are. Build trust, exposure, and good will :)

> **Response 2:** Can also give a lecture at local community centers for the city. Our city does lectures all the time and they are grateful for volunteers who want to talk to the residents, especially if you are local to that town!

So I have an opportunity to go from being a woman show to working in a gym with personal trainers and lots of modalities such as hyperbaric chamber, red light therapy, cold plunge, and saunas. I would be providing PT services along with wellness such as dry needling and cupping. Has anyone gone down this route and is there anything I am missing? TIA 

Pros: we both benefit from each other's clients. I have more access to gym equipment, modalities and space. 

Cons: I would be working for them, further drive from my client population. 

I am so torn

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree not to work for them. U work for yourself.  Maybe agree to collaborate at their gym space 1or  2x a wk. Then u can stay avail to your local already established clients. You could buy a ref light laser for your own mobile practice use and charge for it

> **Response 2:** I would ask to rent the space with a short term initially to test the waters. 
We rented space from a gym and it went really well.
We did eventually open a space with those modalities and that’s the only reason we left. We now rent out our extra rooms to a DPC and masseuse. 
We do still have people from that gym come see us.

If I am out of network, cash pay only; do I need a POC signed by MD? I’m in MA. Does anyone have a link to the appropriate website for the practice acts for each state?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No, MA is direct access and you would only need referral or POC for insurance reasons. If you’re cash you are set without.

> **Response 2:** I think it depends on your practice act, but I believe we are supposed to at least send the POC out, but it doesn't need to be signed.

Does anyone have suggestions on reaching out to an ortho surgeon to tell them of your role in a patient's progress? Without going into great detail, I've dropped info & progress report with a previous patient. But current patient I didn't have a referral from this doctor. But the doctor is very pleased with their progress. I like to believe is in part to the services I provided the patient. I'd like it to get past front desk. A personal letter mailed introducing myself & the care provided to 2 mutual patients? Kind of name dropping, but attempting to figure out how to move beyond front desk & the standard referral to their physician owned clinic. Also not sure I can do this if they weren't a referring provider. 🤔

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I email them directly

> **Response 2:** Ask your patient to champion you and your services.  Talk to them about how a patient expressing to their doctor that they had a great experience, having the patient encourage the doctor to refer more to you, and have them reiterate this every time they go.  A patient going above and beyond to sing your praises is going to sway your doctor much more than anything you say.  Coach your patient on these conversations before each follow up visit with ortho.

**Original Post:**
How do you go about contacting patient’s PCP/MDs who come directly to you without a referral and need a POC/rerferral sent to continue care? Do you call their offices and speak with their front desk and ask them to fax you and BCBS a referral?   And when documenting, do you put their MD/surgeon as the ‘Referring provider’ even though the patient came straight to you but assuming referral will be the surgeon? 

I have a new patient s/p THA, did not want the home health they recommended and came straight to me. BCBSTX PPO.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** is this due to an HMO?  most of what your asking about isn't needed, depending on your state practice act.

> **Response 2:** Do the evaluation. Document Referral: Self via direct access/provider name you will be faxing to. (Assuming your state has at least partial DA) Send completed POC to MD office for signature within 30 days. All you need is a signed POC. You don’t need an order in addition to that.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I shared on my social medias and then lots of friends shared my posts to their personal pages and to the facebook mom groups across town. Before I left the hospital I emailed the physicians I worked with to tell them I was starting my own practice. I gave them a forwarding email address which contained my company name but did not advertise my company in so many words. I set up meetings with them after I left as a rep of my own company. About 20-30 of my clients came with me, I kept their contact information for when I was ready to launch.

> **Response 2:** I ran naked down main street holding a sign with our practice name and phone number.

Hey Uncaged Folks!  Is anyone on here that's doing mobile cash-pay PT also have a fitness professional (strength coach or personal trainer) working with them seeing mobile clients under their business model (as a contracted employee)?  If so, I'd love to see how that's working from a marketing standpoint, etc.  Also, for specifics, I wondered: do folks like this have a certain type of insurance they should carry, since healthcare malpractice doesn't apply?  Lastly, I am in Kansas City - wondering what a good rate would be for mobile fitness sessions if anyone has insight in that regard.  Thanks a million.  I'll attach my website, as I am new to business (9 months in!) and would love any feedback or ideas the group may have for me.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do. I have a PT assistant that also is a personal trainer and I have my CSCS as well. Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions!

What should I expect to pay for rent? 
I'm in a 300 sq. ft. space inside a CrossFit-style (not CF branded) gym. I'm good friends with the guy that owns the building and the gym, and he has let me build out the space and get my cash business started rent free thus far. He approached me tonight about starting to pay rent, but left the amount up to me. Obviously as a business owner, I want to tell him $1/month (ha!), but he's a good friend and is also a great referral source, as he's pretty popular in our small town, so I want to come up with a fair price. 
Pros:
Free utilities, internet
Gym has almost zero attendance until a bout 5pm everyday
Access to lots of general gym/workout equipment 

Cons:
Location on a side street, no frontage on a main road
Limited signage
Front door is always locked and gym members have a swipe card 
Gym area has only limited climate control (I do have AC/heat in my clinic area)
The owner does not make a profit off the gym, and prefers to keep membership low. It's basically his large friend group, so there isn't a substantial built-in referral base. 

For those who rent space in a gym, or sublease space in any other facility, what would a 300sq ft room cost? For reference, this is a relatively low income town and low cost of living area.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Whatever you decide do research and find an average. Present him the research/average and round up to a nice number. He deserves that respect.

Example: average for your square foot is $429/month. I'd round up to $475 or $500 per month. Don't round up too much but whatever you think is enough for him to feel appreciated

> **Response 2:** You could start out offering him a percentage like 25 percent of each visit not to exceed a certain total amount per month.That may work while still building and that way your not stressed about always coming up with that set amount each month.

Does anybody have any suggestions on how to better objectify or even "gamify" mobile gym visits? I have some high achieving clients (think retired MDs on level 11,356 of Candy Crush) who embrace the challenge of PT- increasing weights, more challenging and dynamic tasks, hitting their daily goal steps, etc.- who I think would really excel at objective, goal-setting challenges. Any apps, tracking devices, programs, approaches etc. that anyone's had success with implementing!?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you have a few of them set up monthly fitness challenge goals & someone is a winner each month. Maybe even a cheesy trophy that means nothing, just bragging rights 🏆

So I'm taking to the boots on the ground approach. Where do yall get your referrals from?
 I went to one gym in town and apparently one of the trainers there is a PT (I'm curious who it is as I live in a small town and know most of the PT here....maybe an office person misunderstanding). There are others I plan to go to as well. 
Background: I work HH. I miss my ortho. This is going to be a side gig for me. I don't want to deal with private insurance. So I want it to be 100% cash. Talked with my current boss, he doesn't care if I do cash PT, only restriction is no Medicare to avoid "stealing" of potential clients.

> **Response 1:** Who else serves your client…

That’s your hint 😉

> **Response 2:** I have found that "PT" gets confusing for people in the gym because they use "PT" as personal trainer, whereas we therapists obviously know it as "physical therapy/ist."

I have a mobile cash-pay practice in Indiana. I want to offer some group sessions/workshops in a local public park.  Do I need to get a special permit from my state or county in order to do this? Should I contant the parks department to get it approved? Do I need to take any special conderations with insurance? I just want to make sure I'm being fully compliant and cover all my bases.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Where are you in Indiana?

> **Response 2:** 1. Check that your insurance covers you wherever you are
2. Just to be on the safe side, get the ok from the city Parks & Rec department.  If you are holding formal group events, it’s safest to let them know

If yes, what were the results?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I work with Jordan at Behind the Practice - it has honestly been transformational for my business. I'm about a year into my practice and didn't have much of an online presence at all (was relying solely on word of mouth and local network). I tried working with a larger scale marketing/ad company over the summer and didn't see progress over the span of 4 months (a whole story), but switched to using Behind the Practice in October. He is a PT himself so he completely understands the ins and outs of my practice. I went from getting 0 to 1 leads per month to 5 in October, 10 in November, and already 14 in December. And most of those leads (~80%) convert to an evaluation and plan of care. Beyond happy with the progress and would recommend him to anyone.

> **Response 2:** Jenny Gill is an OT who is well versed in SEO.

Hello friends, I have a new patient tomorrow with BCBS who is coming without a referral. Based on Georgia direct access rules, I understand I can see the patient for up to 8 visits or 21 days (whichever comes first) without a physician referral. Please confirm if I’m correct, and advise if there’s anything specific I should be mindful of when submitting claims to insurance.

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Understanding of direct access is correct.

Some insurances require a referral for reimbursement. 

If you are in network you might want to check. I believe a lot of BCBS plans are now requiring pre-auth

If you are out of network then I would still advise that the patient check to see. In my experience for GA with BCBS patients have been able to submit superbills for potential reimbursement prior to us receiving  a referral without any issues.

If you are out of network and submitting the claim yourself, check to make sure a referral isn't needed. If so, then you'll have to follow their process to ensure you'll get paid.

> **Response 2:** Correct

I rent space out of a gym currently for my PT practice and specialize in working with athletes. Referrals from in house have been steady, but not enough to keep my schedule full. (It’s a small private gym.) 

No surprise that while other gyms and fitness facilities don’t offer PT in house, referring clients to me because I am located in a gym is a barrier. 

Any advice on how to best approach outside trainers or gym facilities in this situation?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Gyms are territorial. 
It's easiest when they've been your patients and "get it" or get the type of client you are looking for.
Like anything these relationships take time to nurture, and knowing how much energy to put into the "right" relationships. It's like dating, they won't say yes on the first date. Keep showing up if you think it's worth the energy.

> **Response 2:** I was located in a CrossFit gym, and got referrals from all the other CrossFit gyms. For me it came down to knowing the individual trainers/coaches at the gyms, not the owners. Owners will be overprotective of their business (which is probably hurting them). The trainers and coaches will just do whatever they need to, to help their clients. 

If you have contact with the owners, you just need to make sure they know that your goal is to get their members healthy and back into their own gyms as quickly as you can so they don’t cancel their memberships or feel like they are wasting them.

Hey all, from what I understand there have to be certain policies included on your website (like terms and conditions and such). After searching the group, I saw termageddon recommended. If you use termageddon, do you think the price is worth it? Does this cover everything that has to be on the website? Google is not currently being of much help on what all has to be included on the website of a healthcare practitioner (I'm assuming I'm searching the wrong terms), so I'm not even sure where to look. I have all of my privacy and consent forms from Gwen Simons, but I'm assuming that the website info is different. For reference: I am cash only, no Medicare, and in Indiana.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, you need a terms and conditions, policies page, and if you have a blog or medical info on site those should include a medical disclaimer. Affiliate disclaimer also in those if you're an affiliate. I use plug and law for myself and clients. It's $99 for both. The links for these two pages can just go at bottom of your webpage footers. They are FTC required and search engines can penalize you for not having them.

**Original Post:**
Ok this isn’t necessarily uncaged related but I need help! I wanted to start my own business but I’m just not in a place to do that right now. 

I currently work for a large hospital system. I feel like they have treated me fairly for the past 10 years but I really want to grow and learn how to run a clinic. However, I think our managers do wayyy too much. 

I recently was offered a position at a new local clinic that is physician owned. They have offered me the salary I wanted plus commission off any new business I bring into the clinic. They are wanting me to run and help grow the clinic which is a great “manager” role. My friend works as a PTA and loves the owners and has really loved working there so far. I’m really torn on what to do. I am hesitant to work for a physician owned clinic and I really don’t know anyone who has in the past.

I’m not crazy about their current referral base since it is currently from the pain clinic but has the potential to expand to orthopedics. 

Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What a wonderful opportunity for you to get an idea of what a different business runs like! And to get to know those physicians in case you DO start a business in the future (if you’re like me in Texas you still need MD referral with our limited access). Sounds like you have the opportunity to learn and grow, build a new population base for this group, and in turn you would be learning to market as well. And you’re making the money you want. Just check to see what their non-compete is in case you do start your own thing in the future and have worked to give them a lot of business that you won’t be able to use for yourself. I want to say most people that end up staying with physician owned clinics really love it. They can be poorly run too, but in that case you’re really learning what NOT to do and then moving on to other things. If you have a good recc from someone I’d say go for it!

> **Response 2:** Having done both one problem with a  single referral source us that you don’t see as much variety in approach and getting other physicians patients to come to another physicians clinic  is never easy

Why do some people rise under pressure while others stall?

This week, David Bayliff sits down with former pro athlete and business coach **Matt Phillips** to unpack one of the most important traits of every great leader — *confidence.*

💥 Confidence isn’t something you’re born with. It’s something you build — through practice, reflection, and consistency.

In this powerful episode, David and Matt dive into:
➡️ Why confidence is the #1 skill for success in business (and life)
➡️ The connection between sports and leadership
➡️ How to reset when your confidence takes a hit
➡️ The daily habits that help you *train* confidence like a muscle
➡️ Why community and relationships make all the difference

Matt shares an insight that hit home for us all:
> 

“The number one skill you have to build and continue to grow throughout your entire life to be successful at anything is confidence.”

Remember: confidence isn’t about perfection — it’s about *belief.*

Belief that you can accomplish the task, no matter the challenge.

If you’re ready to show up, make the tough calls, and lead better — this episode is for YOU.

I know word of mouth is best for referrals but if your target patient is elderly and stays home most the time what is another way to advertise to that client?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1. The elderly love Facebook lol
2. I'm not a big fan of print advertising but it could be a good fit for your clientele potentially if they read a newspaper, magazine, etc. You might even be able to reach out to your local newspaper and see if they will feature you as a local business, I know our newspaper here does that for free. 
3. I'm sure there are also certain spots they hang out at that you could do a free workshop or something like that.
4. Local SEO might be a good fit if you feel your clients are often Googling things

> **Response 2:** Mobile primary care physicians ☺️

Hey y’all!

When marketing to physicians, how do you take them from liking the idea of what we do to actually referring patients to us?

They mostly say the same thing of “that is an amazing idea, we would love to refer to you” but don’t end up referring anyone.

Thank you for your advice.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Try to send one of your patients/ athletes to them. 

Then when they go back for a follow up with the physician, they see first hand what a great job you did, the patient will talk you up and will open dialogue for future work together

If you have a CRM, what are you using it for? I currently use Go High Level, but feel I don't really get the best use out of it. Its the user not GHL LOL.

I currently have my phone/messaging, website, contacts and referral sources on the CRM. I love it for my referral sources as its so much easier to track my conversations with providers/local business vs a spreadsheet.
While I hear it so useful, I wonder what else I can use it for? At times it feels just like another system to have in addition to my EMR?

Looking for ideas on how to use it to its full capacity to see if its truly worth the money. If anyone else has other ways to track and manage their referral system, I'd love to hear as a spreadsheet just got to cumbersome.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We love GHL and we use it for everything from email automation to setting up sales funnels for ads. When you get it going it can make all that extra work of going to meta ads manager or a separate email service or sending review requests get a lot easier. Stick with it and I’m happy to talk more about it

> **Response 2:** Hey I’m on GHL too I I’ve been working on some automations and email campaigns. I’d love to brainstorm some ideas if your up for it.

does anyone use Google ads ? 
have they helped?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Google Ads can be a massive help, but results vary based on clinic type, your market, your website and ad budget.

Are you cash or insurance? Hybrid? What patient population are your targeting?

For instance, I've seen a TON of ad spend wasted on a small Google Ads budget in an area with little search volume. Targeting cash pay patients with a limited Google ads budget is difficult because a small budget means limited keywords to bid on, which means you're only targeting the highest buyer intent keywords and the vast majority of those keyword searches are coming form people who were referred to physical therapy and want to use their insurance and already have their minds made up.

If you need a quick and more predictable turn around personally I've found Facebook ads to be the fastest because you're reaching a much larger bucket of prospects because it doesn't require them to make a search before starting the conversation. $500 budget won't get you very far though.

If all I had was $500/mo to spend, I'd spend it on building and nurturing local relationships, and invest in ads when I'm ready to view it as an investment I want to scale vs a static number that I'm willing to light on fire every month.

Question about rebranding (or starting a secondary brand).

Over the last 4 years or so my practice has been focused on dancers and performing arts. It's all we've seen thus far. 

Recently took on some non-dance clients that were referred us, which I've had great success with and apparently some word has gotten out (which is great!). I do not want to reject this population as of course it could be another source of income for us (and honestly, perhaps more steady). 

Since I am in a niche population of dance, I understand that our branding doesn't necessarily speak to the general population. 

Our clinic brand is recognizable in the dance community so I'm not changing that. 

To attract a different population is it worth it to rebrand? Do I start a "new" clinic? A DBA? 

Just need to hear some thoughts so any insight is appreciated. Has anyone run into similar situations? 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d def discuss with your accountant—but my guess would be DBA

> **Response 2:** I feel like Dinah Hampton of Pivot Dance & Pivot Sport in Canada could be a great person to chat with!

I recently employed a bilingual PT and I’m looking for idea to increase access to Spanish speaking populations. We are a neuro PT/OT clinic!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** - Printed services information in Spanish
- ask your new hire of neighbors/businesses she is willing to bring the brochures/biz cards to (if marketing is on her duty list or can do during down time as her schedule fills up?)
- any medical offices/services that cater to that demographic  that you can market too

> **Response 2:** The only time I'm surrounded by Spanish Speakers is at Church so I would start there if they're a person of faith

For those doing mobile outpatient PT, how do you screen for your own self safety when starting a new patient? 

Patients will come from word of mouth referral or from a MD referral and I would use observation and general safety awareness tactics, but I’m curious what others are doing.  
I am in a large metropolitan area.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pre-screen with phone calls (infections, general PMHx, patient support, animals, access to home?), know your local area (ex. Downtown SD has low income areas with very common infestation of bugs), set firm professional boundaries, know when to limit supplies that need to go in the home, and pre-assess for cognitive issues/psychiatric illness. 

I can do all this with a quick chart review and phone call screening.

> **Response 2:** Ensuring someone else knows where you are is important. Someone else who knows your schedule and where you’re supposed to be and when you’re supposed to be done.

For a patient who only comes for a few sessions in less than 30 days, I know they don't need a referral as per direct access. Do they still need a POC sent to their physician if treatment is shorter than 30 days. If state dependent, it's for NJ and NY. Thanks!

Alright y’all. I am ready to at least take the first few steps. I currently work home health but I’m not getting the hours I need/was told I would get. I need to start out small and local because I’m also due with my third kid in 2 months, but ideally this would help support my maternity leave as well. I’m thinking through a couple options
1. Concierge Orthopedics. They do a good amount of the office work, I schedule my clients, develop my POC etc. it appears I can even set my own rates. They help with the business license, mentoring, marketing, social media. 
2. Doing my own LLC (anybody have any recommendations for a website to obtain this, thoroughly, quickly, for good price), and getting liability ins (also taking recs) and using the NextDoor App and neighborhood moms Facebook groups to advertise PT and or wellness. One niche would be a bit more wellness but helping moms get back into fitness post partum and/or maintaining during pregnancy safely etc (I have done CrossFit for 10 years and at one point was a coach but have let that lapse) with some baseline knowledge of womens health and willing to learn more. The other niche is stroke and (I’m a certified stroke rehab therapist) with a passion for chronic stroke impairments that have now been “written off” as they can’t get better. They very well may have a ceiling but if we can look at some orthopedic limitations that have developed because of bad habits from prior weakness we can improve some quality of life, muscular efficiency, tolerance, pain, a bunch of stuff. 

At first glance concierge ortho is appealing because you have help with some of that stuff, especially for someone who has always worked for a company, so the grass roots marketing for myself feels daunting, but also with an upcoming kiddo on the way, having them help with some of that stuff sounds convenient for this season of life. 

Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yeah, unless you're in one of the states that requires a PLLC, just go to your Secretary of State website and file there. You don't need any other resources.

I use CM&F for insurance.

With the life phase you're in, honestly I'd go the easy route first and then transition after. There's no wrong way, and I love your niches, and you could totally go all in right now and make it work! (Strongly recommend hopping in on the next Bootcamp Josh Payne does, if you jump on the LLC train.) But it would certainly be *easier* to do the "Concierge Ortho" option.

> **Response 2:** I cannot help you make a decision but depending on the state filing an LLC might be as easy as going to your state's Secretary of State website (it's much cheaper that way)

Who's out there using a mic and filming live group exercise classes? Need equipment and editing recommendations.

I would need something to record video and preferably also my mic'd audio. (I do not have a mic yet.)

On the editing side, adjusting my recorded audio to a desirable volume should be pretty simple, right? 😬 We meet in a gymnasium (echo), I talk really loud so everyone can hear me, and I play music through a Bluetooth speaker.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go to my GeriHab Physical Therapy and Wellness . I sometimes steam our group exercise. Don't make it complicated . I use my phone and a lapel mic

> **Response 2:** I use the free version of capcut to edit video clips for Instagram. I haven't recorded large groups and I usually edit out my voice bcuz I don't have a mic. I just use my phone and a tripod to hold my phone. Capcut is great and easy and if you pay for premium you can do more edits to the audio quality. You can also take a video and record the audio separately for better quality and then put them together thru that program

**Original Post:**
Hi all, this is the first time I am completing a Medicare REVALIDATION and they are requesting
" Copy of an organizational structure diagram/flowchart"
The provider must submit an organizational structure diagram/flowchart identifying all of the entities listed and their relationships with the provider and each other.....
What is that?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance #Revalidation - Is this an individual revalidation, or a group revalidation? Per CMS checklist this diagram/flowchart only required for the Group/organizational revalidation. GototheSource

A flowchart is an org chart consistent with documentation provided/updated in Section 5.

Looking to start treating people in groups for exercise/ strength/ balance and endurance training. How would I bill this ? How many clients can be in group?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Would definitely approach this from a wellness side rather than PT.

If they're all in PT for the same things and you want to do group therapy to save time, fine, but the reimbursement is not good. 

If they're all just needing generic/community-accessible physical activity, then do that as a group exercise class instead.

> **Response 2:** Medicare reimburses terribly for group therapy if it’s therapeutic. If it’s wellness then it would be cash pay. I have integrated this into my practice. Let me know if you have any questions

Love to hear what you're doing during and after assmts, how you are marketing, and what type of packages you're offering!  And if you've done seminars on the topic, what worked and didn't work?

**Community Responses:**

Hello I have been approached with a potential business opportunity. I have an acquaintance who owns a lab that produces injectable ￼ peptides. ￼￼They have a group of physicians on staff that assess patients for appropriateness and then prescribe injectable peptides delivered to clients  homes. 

The company would like me to be an affiliate and use them to refer any clients who might be interested in peptides. 

Is anyone in the therapy world already doing this and I’m interested in learning a little bit more about legalities recommending nutritional supplements and injectables. Thanks for any advice or resources. ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PT’s are affiliates for all kinds of supplements, products, etc… I believe the biggest thing here is to make it known that you are an affiliate for them when sending clients to them. Just like affiliates do online, etc. You are just referring - not “recommending” :)

Hi all! Working on website/domain/professional email and so confused with the merger of Google Workspace and Squarespace. It looks like Google is no longer selling domains, but you can still get a workspace account and it looks like set up a professional email (and maybe domain?) for $18/year. Through square space it is $76/year (I think). 

Does anyone have any insight on this? Should I set up professional email through Workspace before getting a website through Squarespace or should I do it all through Squarespace?  Thanks for your time!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I build sites and I highly recommend going thru Google. If you buy it thru squarespace and ever move your website off squarespace it's a nightmare. You'll need to purchase your domain first before you can setup a Google workspace. You can do that on SS or save some money and use namecheap. Once you have the domain, you can set up workspace and build out your site.

Asking for a friend-

This is specific to GA. Still some confusion over dry needling requirements. Can we still needle via direct access or does there have to be an order first? Does the order have to be from MD/DO? I know some gyms that host PTs offer DN so is this being done as “wellness”? Are we allowed to needle under wellness? We are just confused 😂 

Side bar- Why do the laws have to be so gray? I guess on one hand there’s room for interpretation but it makes it confusing from a CYA perspective.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Allison Beaulieu yes technically they will still need an order from an MD/DO regardless. But frankly I don’t concern myself too much with that. I put the risks in my consent form and if they’re going through insurance just tell them to get a script to get reimbursed. In my experience they’ve been fine with that since their just concerned with getting better

Good morning everyone! Happy (almost) Thanksgiving! I have a social media question. I’m wanting to create a Facebook account for my business. Is there a way to link it to my personal account so I don’t have to log out of my personal account and then log in to my business account to check messages or make posts? I’ve been off Facebook for most of the last several years, but I understand it’s how a lot of information is communicated these days, so I figured I’d give it a try. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Facebook makes it easy to switch between personal and business pages without log out/log back in. Just click on your picture at the top right and you will get a menu of which profile you want to be in at the moment.

Anyone here got some experience with the Uncaged Clinician Pathway program?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am a fairly new member and am glad I signed up.  I have had a lot of things going on and haven't been able to really dive full speed into the program but will have the chance to do so this month, and I am super excited.  My goal is to open for business in January, and I would like to not have to learn everything the hard way.  I know how to be a PT, but I don't know how to start and run a business - that's why I signed up for the coaching program.  So far, the one-on-one coaching calls have been fantastic.  I've also learned and gotten some ideas from the bi-monthly group calls even though we are not all at the same point in our businesses.

> **Response 2:** I went through the program in the summer of 2020. I highly recommend the coaching program, worth the investment and helps you get organized as you start your business especially with building relationships and your messaging. The coaches really want the best for you and push you to unlock your potential.

Good Afternoon,
Not a therapy related question. I had been using iPhone for years and now want to change to Google Pixel. Any pros and cons cons? 

PS: Reason to ask in this group is for HIPPA / safety concerns. I know iPhones have good security but don’t know about Google. 

Please advise.

When reaching out to gyms and studios to develop a rapport and discuss workshops, have you identified a maximum distance away from your office/clinic that is worth considering? Debating if it’s worth connecting with establishments 30-45 min away (I personally would travel that far as a patient, but not sure if lost would).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have traveled that far when starting out.

In my practice, I want the clinicians to have good relationships with multiple exercise/fitness groups in our local area. Since it would be a big financial burden to ask them to pay for memberships at all of these different places, CrossFit gyms, Jitsu studios, neighborhood barre, etc would it be considered a legitimate business expense to subsidize this for clinicians in my practice? For instance, purchasing punch passes to a few different places in our area so they can go there and make connections. Thank you! ￼￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you do it as marketing?

> **Response 2:** This has actually worked a few times for me, I have punch passes to different gyms of some my regulars or past patients and i know the classes some of them attend. When things are a bit slow, I go attend a few gym classes and my former patients introduce me to new potential patients who end up having a high show rate because they were introduced to me while they were in their pain point.  Also if I don't meet anyone, I get a good workout lol...win win.

Hi all,

I currently have a cash-based, mobile PT business for neuro rehab on Long Island, NY. Most of my clientele is older due to the nature of my work . I have an instagram page that I historically have not spent a ton of time and effort on, because most of my clients are word-of-mouth or Google search referrals.  I also know my target audience may not be super active on Instagram.

I am interested in trying to attract more telehealth patients, specifically for facial palsies, as I am trained in that/ have found it's a very suitable diagnosis for telehealth compared to other neuro diagnoses. From my clinical experience, that age demographic is more diverse, and might engage more on social media. I was looking into a social media manager for this goal specifically ( it would also be great to increase engagement, etc), and in addition to just offload the work that content creation poses. I have 2 young kids and my extra time is really valuable- I don't want to spend it making reels, haha! 

Does anyone have any input on if a social media manager has been worth the money for you, assuming it is within your budget? Especially if you are looking to target a specific audience/caseload?

Thank you :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi, I also have a mobile physical therapy practice on Long Island New York. I would love to connect! I offer a hybrid business model.

When you receive a subpoena for records, do you notify the client as a courtesy?  Or just send the info? 

Some details (that I don’t think are particularly relevant but just in case):
A few months ago my client’s lawyer requested records- I send them to the client who provided to the lawyer and that was settled.

Now the other lawyer has sent a subpoena for the same records.

My instinct is to let my client know as a courtesy, but I’m not sure if that’s legal?  This is my first time in this situation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Did they provide a signed consent? If so, the client should already be aware

Hi, I'm curious about what Texas PTs who offer dry needling "a la carte" cash services do in this situation. If you have a patient that wants to be dry needled every month or so for "maintenance" purposes, do you have them get a referral after the first session so they can come for the whole year? Or is it possible to count these as wellness visits without the referral?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They do $30 if a patient, and $60 if not, and still have to sign a waiver (MI)

> **Response 2:** I bill for DN in TX. It's counted as wellness for the most part.

What tips do y’all have for establishing connections with other professionals and businesses in the area (as far as for genertainf referral sources)? I’m a mobile cash based practice is justt getting started. Thinking it would be good to get the ball rolling with reaching out to nearby physician offices, chiros, dieticians… others? And ways to appeal to them in receiving referrals?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Figure out what your niche is. Where does this niche hang out at? Speak directly to them i.e. workshops or just leading with value. When connecting with other businesses get to know their business first. Build a long term relationship where you see congruence with your business. Keep pounding the pavement weekly. Make a list of your possible dream top 100 referral partners. Then cut it down to top 20 and go after them first.

Hi all! Looking for some guidance. I'm struggling on how I may want to move forward in my career, and I'm considering pursuing a certification in order to better market myself. I have experience in outpatient ortho as well as acute care. I'm hoping to get into an outpatient position at some point, but I'm not feeling drawn specifically to any specialty. Of the three below options, which would you feel would look best to a referring physician? For those who have pursued these specialties, do you feel they have been work it? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Who cares what a referring physician thinks?

Who are you excited to work with? What population / subgroup would you treat for free and can't believe you get paid to work with?

If you're just looking to make the most $$, physical therapy is NOT the place!  Pay is questionable at best, documentation requirements are terrible (if you're in-network).  

BUT... I got to see an old woman's face light up today.  She stood up for the first time since July (& gave me the credit... despite her being the one dealing with the pain and crippling fear of fallin again).

> **Response 2:** You’d have to do market research to know which one would be most valuable in your community.

Planning to be mobile/online based. What do y'all use for your business email? I'd like it to be ***@businessname.com, but not sure how that all works! 
And is a business phone number necessary with the practice model I'll have?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great questions! Here’s how to tackle both:

Business Email

To get an email like *@businessname.com, you’ll need:

1. Domain Name: Purchase your domain from a provider like Google Domains (currently transitioning to Squarespace), GoDaddy, or Namecheap.

2. Email Hosting: Use a service like Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) or Microsoft 365. Both allow you to link your domain and create professional business emails. For example, Google Workspace costs around $6/month per user and comes with Gmail, Drive, and other tools.

Once your domain is set up, these platforms guide you through connecting it to your email hosting.

Business Phone Number

For a mobile or online-based practice, having a business phone number helps separate personal and business communications and builds professionalism.
Options:

Google Voice: Free for basic use, or $10+/month for advanced features.

RingCentral or Grasshopper: Paid options that provide more tools like call forwarding, texting, and voicemail.

VoIP Apps: Services like OpenPhone or Sideline are affordable and integrate seamlessly with mobile devices.

A business phone number isn’t mandatory but is helpful if you’ll be communicating regularly with clients, insurance companies, or referrals. Plus, it ensures your personal line stays private.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m 100% mobile I have a Google page. It’s my top referral source. You can set your location to towns that you travel to. My patients leave Google reviews and they’ve helped me become the top search result for pelvic PT in the area.

**Original Post:**
Could use some insight into potential for kickback law violations??

Here's what's going on: 

I have been networking with local businesses and got connected with a small gym in the area. We did a service trade experience where I went in and did their initial consult process at the gym, and the owner's wife came to my clinic and I gave her a free eval (I'm in women's pelvic health). We basically got familiar with how we each approach things and we have very similar views on health and wellness. We both feel like working together would be a good fit and are trying to find ways to work together and support each other. They've tried workshops in the past but they feel like they fall short with their clientele so they aren't super keen on that idea.

They then proposed the idea to me that if I sent people their way, they would pay me the equivalent of that person's first month membership.

I've been digging into kickback laws and it seems pretty black and white that if they were another medical provider, it would be a violation. But when it's not another medical provider it seems like a gray area? It's my first time running into this and I want to make sure I'm solid on this. Not sure if this is common practice in other industries to compensate for referrals? If so I'd also like to have a better response if it ever comes up again.

Any insight is greatly appreciated 🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is 100% lawyer territory. I wouldn’t trust any Facebook group on this because the repercussions of a wrong choice could be severe and expensive.

> **Response 2:** Not an attorney obviously but I think in general receiving compensation for referrals is a bad idea. 

That being said, I don’t think this would be much different from being an affiliate for a product that you promote to patients where you get a cut of sales. Always a good idea to disclose your interest to the patient up front but I wouldn’t think you’re out of bounds legally.

I have a meeting planned with a primary care physician who is opening up a concierge practice. I would like to present the option of working with her practice. 
- I am thinking about annual PT assessments being offered to her clients and/or giving her practice access to my practice as some sort of a partnership. 

1) Has anyone partnered with a local concierge physician? 
2) If so, how did you structure the partnership? 
Did anything specific work or not work well?
3) is there anything that you found concierge physicians really need/want or see value in offering to their clients that a PT can assist with? 

Thank you so much in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in geriatrics and most of my referrals are from a concierge MD,but I also tell everyone about her services as most don’t know there is an option to get a physician to come to their home! It’s a win win.

**Original Post:**
Advice appreciated cause I don’t know who to ask! This group is an absolute blessing.… 

Background info first:
I’m a DPT, CSCS with an LLC. 
Main gig is independent contractor at an ortho clinic and then I see private clients/athletes under my LLC with home visits. 

I also work for a gym 0-10 hours/week. Clients see me for personal training, recovery sessions, and physical therapy. The gym pays me as their highest level trainer. I do not operate out of the gym as my business, they pay me W2. Clients pay the gym, gym pays me as employee. So this is where all my questions come from with this setup. 

Most important question:
- I offer my home visit LLC clients a superbill obviously since that is my business but a gym client is asking, I said no since she pays the gym and not me (my personal info & medical credentials is not on her bills, she pays for a level X trainer). Is this the right assumption? Is there a better explanation to give her? I said, “I don’t think so but I’ll do some research.” They then asked/suggested if I could write a letter with my info, medical reasons they are being seen and attach a gym bill… I’m not sure how to proceed     🙏 any advice?🙏 

Two other questions if anyone has read this far: 
- Trainers want me to assess their Medicare age clients for minor injuries, HEP, and program advice/modifications. The goals are for in the gym & wellness is not covered by Medicare. Even so do I need to have them sign something strictly because they are consulting with a PT and no cash PT with Medicare eligible? Or should i just be extra clear in my personal documenting?

Consent form:
- I assume I’m covered by the gym since I’m hired as a trainer but they don’t have anything to help regarding my license (I’m assuming). Because of this should I have those seeing me because I’m a PT sign a consent from my LLC? I have liability insurance under my LLC with the gyms name in the policy. Would a form even be valid in case something happened since the client never paid the LLC but only the gym?

In order to be a business you must act like a business but this pay setup makes that quite confusing 🫠. This is my fun job that I’m using to learn from, it’s not permanent but I’d rather not give it up because having a PT license is over complicating it lol

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would not provide the gym client a superbill. You are seeing her as a trainer, not a PT. Though you are held to your highest license, if you start providing superbills at the gym you are essentially saying you are performing PT services which is not the intended job there and could get very muddy. If she wants to see you for reimbursable services she would have to see you through your LLC, in my opinion. Please note that all of this is just how I would operate things and is not intended as legal advice. Hope that helps.

> **Response 2:** If a gym client wants Physical Therapy give her option of home based or office based treatments not at the gym. Jumping back and forth as a trainer the a PT doing injury assessments and education is creating confusion for you so imagine how confused clients and patients will be. As far as liability in the event something happens and a law suit is filed typically Everyone gets pulled into the suit. Who ever pays the premium is the sole responsibility of that insurance company. Always protect yourself with your own policies even if employers has a policy with your name on it also.

Has anyone had an issue with their practice not appearing on Google Maps search? How were you able to fix it? I’ve given up on trying to get someone from Google on the phone after being on hold for an hour… 

And yes, I have verified my business with Google! It appears if you search for the business name. But it does not if you search for “physical therapy” or “physical therapist” in that area. Thanks in advance!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Get nore reviews probably you are on page 5 it happened to us in the  beginning and after about 7 reviews we went to the front page

> **Response 2:** Do you have all your category tags set up in GMB? If you have those and you're verified it may just be a waiting game. It takes quite a while for Google to show you on maps as a new business unfortunately, but posting photos, getting reviews, and optimizing your website for local search can def help. Also, being inside another business can make Google take longer to show you from what we've found.

Hey all, I am still confused about reimbursement via FSA/HSA accounts. I am doing myofascial release and lymphatic drainage. I know with Square I can sign up for the card swipe thing and do that... but I am not really doing documentation and I am not doing "occupational therapy". I am marketing myself as doing therapeutic bodywork. So... can clients use FSA/HSA when they come to see me? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm a Licensed Massage Therapist and Certified Lymphedema Therapist. Most of what I do is MLD and MFR. I have no issues excepting HSA/FSA through Square. If there is ever an issue, the company reaches out to the client and I provide them when a receipt on my official letterhead that describes what we're doing. As long as the companies know that we're not doing "￼spa massage," they approve and the card is not flagged again.

> **Response 2:** Never had an issue and I personally use my HSA on Amazon, various health providers (traditional and non-traditional included), etc. I have patients use this for private pay PT and wellness too without issue

What kind of end of year/start of new year promos are you guys doing? Thinking of doing an email campaign

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I send out my annual Rate Card update with a “Happy New Year“ message, which also serves as “marketing” of the menu of services I offer. (I do Industrial PT on-site services/consulting). Unfortunately, this year it’s going to include a price increase which I avoided last year, but two years in a row of this inflation has forced the issue. Fortunately, I’m still well below the cost of my big corporate competitor in my market, (whom I used to contract with and is still a good referral source - Never burn your bridges!) so I have room to do so. This is also the time of year when I am booking the most “speaking engagements” as Plant Safety Managers are planning their annual calendars, including at least one “Safety Day” and always need speakers for those, so my annual New Years mailing also kick starts those requests/scheduling. I do not offer any discounts as my regular clients know the value, and new clients come by word of mouth.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jenny Gill does a brand messaging intensive for OTs (and I’m sure PTs and SLPs are welcome too) 

She also is my go-to gal for custom website copy. (I prefer sales pages + email marketing) 

She can give you the details, but I can vouch for her quality! 

I know a few website builders I can refer to as well.

Do you already have your business up and running? Or are you just in the planning stage?

Would love to start a side hustle and service my local community as an OT. 

Advice on how to get started with mobile therapy?? Is that considered outpatient ? Do I see them in their house if I don't have an office space (don't have the fund to rent) 

I understand OT has direct access in NYC, so I don't need a referral for an eval, but do I need a PCP to sign the patients POC? 

Thank you all

> **Response 1:** You can use the hostinger website builder to drag and drop the design. WordPress is a little harder to use right out of the box but you can always install a plug-in like Elementor to give you drag and drop capabilities. There are pros and cons to each. If you are tech savvy, value SEO, and have time to learn WordPress, id suggest going down that road for a long term plan.

> **Response 2:** I build mine on squarespace. It’s VERY user friendly and super easy to create a great looking site.

Question: 
I’m a LPTA, Certified Comprehensive Pilates Instructor and Myofascial Release Practitioner Certification. I have been an employee at my current PT clinic for 15 years. I have developed Pilates programs including pilates group classes patients can join, private and semi-private lessons on various pilates apparatuses. I also see people for Myofascial release sessions for 60-90 minutes (they are first seen by PT on Evaluations). 

Anyways I’m planning on starting my own pilates and wellness center by September 2024. I’m sure I will have some clients follow me to my new business. Can my current employer sue me if clients follow me? I’m going to be getting a business lawyer to help me with my start up but wanted to hear feedback from you all too. ￼

Thank you kindly for your input, 
Colleen

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I mean... Anyone CAN sue someone else. But it would be a shoddy case. Customers have the right to go wherever they please.

I'm a PT and a couple of my patients followed me when I left my clinic. I was upfront with my clinic director and my team. I chose not to "advertise" myself beyond letting patients know I would be leaving. I made it clear that it would be perfectly fine if they stayed at the clinic. If they wanted more info, I gave it to them.

Also, congrats on prepping for your own thing. 💛

> **Response 2:** I don’t have a legal answer. I am a PTA. However if you mention your new start up in a casual conversation during treatment once you have a website and social media platform is one thing.  I would suggest that handing out  a flyer/business card with your all pertinent information  could be construed as a dirty move which could cause at the least  serious Tension. Lmao . .  Pilates + MFR with your PTA background sounds like an awesome combo for wellness!!!!!  Your going to do great!!!

**Original Post:**
Would anyone here rent a room out of a private outpatient therapy clinic? You are responsible for getting your own patients, you have access to the front desk person (which you may get patients from as well), but ultimately you are responsible for your own people. Have access to the common area gym and have your own private office. 5 private offices total and you have one. Does that sound appealing? You have to do your own billing but you can utilize the front desk to call anyone if you are busy. And they base their monthly fee off a full schedule so when I did the math it’s taking roughly 30% of each person. (Figuring about $100 per session). Does that sound like a good deal? I’m a solo therapist but would be nice to have a space and not be committed to being on the lease and all that. 
What’s a good monthly amount to pay? It’s Florida

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like a lot of $. Access to equipment? Do you need front desk staff? Do they really work for you? Or, will you be an add on to their to do list? How would referrals work? If a person is referred to you and walks in the door will you be contacted or will that be countered as a general walk in client? Paying a flat for an office that is yours to use as you wish and when you wish would be better. Do not let someone make up your productivity level and take a percentage of each potential patient.

> **Response 2:** Maybe check out office suite rentals. I am in centra Florida and found one in an apartment building. I have access to their gym(it’s super big and nice) the pool and waiting area. $750 including electric and wi fi.  I’m OON so no billing. I do my own calls.

**Original Post:**
I am currently in the process of starting a mobile PT practice in NJ, primarily Medicare Part B, however, I have been getting a few cash clients as well. I am curious about the direct access in NJ, because as I read the law, as long as the patient is making progress and there are no red flags, I just need to inform the primary MD that I am seeing the patient after 30 days? Can anyone in NJ explain this to me and how you handle this. Do I just send a plan of care with goals after 30 days? Does the MD need to sign a POC like they would for Medicare or I literally just need to make them aware that I am treating the patient and they are making progress?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same set up, and yes this is how I’ve understood it here in NJ. 

If no progress or very limited I usually suggest referral to the patient and send a POC over to the office. 

If pt doing fine I still inform the MD with a full progress note expecting a signed POC (which also confirms they reviewed the doc) but I don’t automatically expect the patient to have an MD visit to continue PT.  My EMR generates them quickly and after 30 days Im usually doing some kind of re-eval anyway. 

Covers my ass, generates good multidisciplinary networking and establishes good communication. 

From there it’ll vary by MD. Some just sign and return some want to see their patients.

Merry Christmas everyone!

I have a lot of physician offices that refer me patients. I got them all some nice little typical Christmas gift baskets.

For a few offices I wanted to get them a Theragun for the office staff to use while working. Is that ethically okay? I just wanted to be sure.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are Medicare providers it is generally acceptable to give a perishable gift that can be shared with all of the staff. Anything more than that is unethical. At our facility our employer limits gifts to nothing more than $25 value.

> **Response 2:** #Compliance Under your compliance program - address legal aspects of gifting w/referral sources, and application of federal health care laws.

Asking for suggestions. I have an LLC and want to start marketing a mobile outpatient clinic with just me, a PT. I currently see mostly geriatric patients and post op joint replacements but also have my LSVT Big certification and really enjoy working with my current population. I have an opportunity to have a booth at a local wellness event and need some suggestions/recommendations on how to make my booth stick out. Besides business cards should I have give aways also? I was thinking of offering quick fall screenings and stuff. The event is 1/3/26 so coming up soon but was just offered the opportunity to have a booth at the event!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do a lot of corporate events like this and the most popular giveaways Ive ever done were hyperice products (the giveaway depended on the size of the event). I’m also a sports med clinic so it fit the clinic brand. 

I also usually hire a massage therapist to give out free 5-10 minute chair massages. The person has to fill out a lead magnet before they are allowed to the massage this way I have their contact info to reach out to after the event.

**Original Post:**
Group Coaching is akin to you as a physical therapist taking all of your current back pain patients in a clinic, and telling them:

“Moving forward, all of you will be treated in a group and we will be doing the same exercises to cure your back pain.”

If we were told to treat that way in a clinic we would argue with our superiors that our clients wouldn’t get 100% better in a group scenario, but yet, we accept it for ourselves as business owners. 

I would say that 95% of business owners aren’t experiencing the growth that they want in their business because of personal factors rather than having the right tactic for marketing. 

Those personal factors such as imposter syndrome, self-esteem, fear, a spouse not supporting the business, anxiety, ego, etc etc are the major road blocks to substantial and SUSTAINABLE success in business.

You need a personal mentor to coach you through that. 

Just like you would be appalled to treat back pain patients in a group setting in the above scenario…

I am also appalled at the amount of people who simply accept this as “good enough” as they strive to become the best business owner they can be. 

I don’t want 80% better for you. I want you to become the best business owner that you can be so that you can radically transform your life AND the lives of your clients. 

This takes personal one-on-one attention and deep work.

I am in NJ, have a braven health referral. Old office I used to work for had me registered as out of network provider so they had my Info but I need to now register with my company details.
Is it worth to be an in network provider ? Or an out of network provider? unable to find their reimbursement rates.

First time situation….
I have a pt direct access without referral amd has Medicare.. I am a participating provider.
What do you guys use for medical diagnosis in such case? I am still going to send POC to MD for signature just in case gets extended beyond 30 days as pt travels a lot .
Tx diagnosis would be R26.89 . Can I use the same in medical Dx? 
I am so lost. 😞 
Any help is highly appreciated. 🙏🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Use therapy dx. But remember, direct access doesn't apply for Medicare. You'll need the signed POC.

> **Response 2:** In some cases I have used R29.898

What do you use to run demographic information to determine your new clinic location? Is there a way to find out about percentage of Medicare patients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unless you are planning on opening a Costco size clinic I wouldn’t worry about those numbers too much. 

Are you looking at leasing an existing space or building a new space?

If leasing your options will be limited to what is available. 

When we opened new clinic locations we looked for ample parking near our front entrance, high visibility, easy exit from the parking lot, and we wanted the right neighbors. 

I liked opening in areas with hospital outpatient clinics or corporate clinics across the street or within view. We pick up a lot of new patients off their marketing and their waitlist. 

I would rather pay $1,000 more on rent and save $3,000 on ads because we are in a highly visible location.

> **Response 2:** Anthony Maritato brings up very good points.  Going into a "low traffic area" because MC clients are close by doesn't equate to them coming to you.  Use the benefit of other facilities being close by to help you!  That is why you see many clinics close to hospitals or even close to other clinics.  Gyms position themselves close to other gyms all the time, in part, for this reason.  Same with food chains

**Original Post:**
We have spoken about the importance of a solid business foundation ad nauseam, but it still needs to be reiterated because it’s THAT IMPORTANT!

We tell ourselves, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, skipping steps will get us there quicker.

We say things like:

“I don’t need those steps”

“that’s not going to help me, I know better”

“I’ve done this work before, just tell me how to market and get more clients.”

Willingness to learn these foundational stepping stones sooner than later, will actually get you where you want to be FASTER!

Having a solid business skeleton reduces the chances of feeling...

“Why am I not making traction?"

"I go to the doctors and they don’t send me any referrals"

"Why am I having trouble with my conversions!?”

“I’ve been doing this for x amount of time, why is that person doing better?”

The “foundations” as we like to say, are really:

Learning to have clarity., “Why am I doing this?”;

Confidence, “I AM capable of doing this”

and Having a message - knowing the service you are delivering.

These are the tools in your entrepreneurial toolbox on how to deliver that message, a.k.a. “marketing.“

The UNCAGED CLINICIAN Launchpad program is designed to equip you with these tools.

To those renting space in a gym:
1. Are there things you need posted to legally run your business out of the gym (labor laws, license, etc). If so, and you don’t have a separate room from the gym, how do you get around this. I’m in MA. 
2. If you’re in a gym space without your own locked room and you do mobile visits, do you need to keep your charts and paperwork that may be on paper in a locked space? Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The Security Rule requires "covered entities to maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for protecting e-PHI."

Most everyone I know uses the double lock rule (not technically required, but good data management) - keeping physical records in a locked file cabinet or similar. For my e-PHI I keep it in a 2nd passworded/encrypted folder for anything stored locally in the event of equipment theft since I'm mobile.

> **Response 2:** Just have a good ehr

For those of you who are fully mobile and having issues with google business profile requiring verification..... Make sure you are setup as servicing an area instead of an address and then chat with them to let them know you don't have an office to video. 
I've been through this twice with clients in the past 2 weeks and it takes them about a week or so, but they sort it out. They usually call you and chat for a bit asking questions and may ask you to send pictures of marketing materials to verify your business is real. 
If you have trouble finding where to chat, the link is below... they are quite helpful with any issues actually.

Hi folks, looking for some advice on how to market effectively and establish a larger footprint. 
I have a part time cash pay practice in CA with a niche focus (circus, pole dance) but am also very comfortable with martial arts, weight lifting, and rock climbing. Though I want to establish myself in this niche community, as I'm starting out I want to prioritize reaching more people so that I can scale. That is to say, I don't want my website to only highlight the niche audience if that will reduce the likelihood of getting other types of athletes, but I also recognize that including too many areas of specialty can dilute the sense of expertise in the area I want to establish myself in.
Any advice on what kind of balance to strike here?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think highlight everything you’re comfortable with on your website, with separate pages on the site for your niche things. Also, my oldest son is named Kelton! I’ve never seen someone else with his name!

Hi! Apologize in advance for how simple this question may be...not very tech savvy. 

I’m trying to write an initial evaluation report in Word. Do I take my practice logo and add it to the header? Where should my contact information go then? I googled but I think I’m using the wrong terminology maybe? Google sent me down a rabbit hole. Looking for any resources to help me figure this out!

I use simple practice but like the idea of generating reports in word and uploading them that way. 

TIA for any guidance this group can provide!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** From a graphic design perspective, I would place your logo in the headed and your contact information along the bottom in the footer

> **Response 2:** if you have all relevant info and contact on the top (header) then your logo can be on the top or bottom;  whoever is reading it will be able to know who wrote this immediately; the signature can have your name typed and then signed and dated; the bottom edge can have more info or repeated (website, email, social media handles, etc). i also have tried to create a watermark of my logo so it shows up very lightly behind the type;

I’m having patients or meeting potential patients being told by their MD/other that they need a facility/gym/equipment sometimes, vs. home health (mobile care). I provide the full spectrum of outpatient PT for a wide span of fitness/ability levels at home. Do you all have ideas you would like to share for educating local doctors and referral sources that the patient can receive the full spectrum of PT/rehab at home, including in regard to knee replacement and other surgical recoveries.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That we provide functional activities and assessment in their HOME that cannot be simulated well at OP clinics. We do activities that they will come across every day and they will help them get back to the things they love and quick. I've never had someone complain yet about our activities being too easy 😉

If you moved offices, have you found that you lost patients in the process? I currently rent from chiropractors who are great at referring patients, but my room is super small (8x10) and has no windows. (Plus it is in the high end at $850/mo. Though is a very nice place). As I transition to full time business I’d like more space AND a window. Don’t want to be stuck in 4 walls all day long. I need natural light. 
Wondering if moving will mess up my caseload a lot…

**Original Post:**
For all you uncaged folks who work out of gyms… 

What’s your arrangement look like? 

At a small impasse with one of the gym owners I work with. He wants me to be there for set hours (takes up my entire day one day a week- I can’t fit patients before or after my gym arrangement on that day) Essentially- wants a PT on retainer. He wants me there even if I have no patients scheduled for the relationship building aspect. Initially- totally fine, I had nowhere else to be, happy to give my time. Now as things in my mobile business get busier, I’m finding myself reducing available hours to paying patients to essentially go burn time. Sounds like he’s not too interested in continuing the relationship with me if I’m showing up only when there’s work to be done. 

He doesn’t pay me, and I don’t give him kickback or pay rent. 

Been there a few months consistently so I feel that at this point, his gym members know I’m there for them if they need me. I’m great about responding to texts and calls. 

I don’t want to disappoint anyone or burn bridges/ throw away an opportunity, but from a business standpoint the current setup doesn’t make good fiscal sense, and it sounds like he’s pretty inflexible with the idea of change. 

Any advice or input appreciated. As PTs would y’all just continue on and keep set hours on days you don’t actively have patients to see? Is that nuts, or is that sort of thing just the necessary sacrifices of early business ownership?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t have my own PT clinic or practice but just speaking out of business experience: if you’re not paying rent or have any obligation to the gym, why does the owner insist you have regular hours? What’s the benefit to the owner? Does the owner want clients to drop in and see you for advise, without an evaluation? Clients are expected to make an appointment for which you get paid. 
if the gym isn’t paying you, you’re not available for “FReE”advise. 
Or was the arrangement that you’re available to all gym clients unless you have a paying client?

> **Response 2:** I would recommend moving on. There are other people out there to network with. Not all may be a good fit. This certainly sounds like one of them

Anyone have a template that your patient signs that authorizes you (the PT) to obtain medical records from their MD? I have previously only used a form that allows me to release information to another practitioner.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think the MD would be the one responsible for getting anything signed for the actual releasing of info anyway. I don’t think there’s a need to have anything signed to accept info, generally speaking. So long as like Derek said the transmission route itself is safe.

> **Response 2:** No need for this. Hippa privacy rule allows for sharing between providers as long as reasonable safeguards are taken to protect the info

**Original Post:**
I once applied to United Healthcare to see their rates but declined. I received a call today from someone saying that I was on their registry for Physical Therapists. Is this normal to be included on a registry affiliated with them?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s part of their strategy. Claim everyone is in network and create the false narrative surrounding that conversation you’ll have with potential clients.

> **Response 2:** I have had patients find me listed as in network but it is under my individual npi when I was employed by another company. I just tell them that is not accurate.

⚡ **Clinicians — this isn’t your average coaching program.**

Most “business coaching” tries to put you in a box.
We burn the box. 🔥

**Uncaged University Term 1** is where **Healthcare Professionals** come when they’re DONE playing by everyone else’s rules — and ready to **build a business that actually reflects who they are**.

Ready to build something that reflects YOU?

**Original Post:**
If I’m coaching instead of treating…. Do I need a license in the state my client is in?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have talked to several different lawyers on this. From what they have all explained, if you are health coaching (meaning something specific is being worked on or they have a diagnosis that is trying to be helped) you have to be licensed in their state. If you are doing wellness coaching (no diagnosis, just working on general health and nothing specific) then you do not need to be licensed

> **Response 2:** Nope. Curious what you are doing from the coaching/wellnesss side of things. I feel like I always have a fear of the “what if” so I tend to be pretty cautious even though I know there is so much more I’m capable of providing beyond “skilled therapy”

What are your top 2 interview questions when hiring a virtual assistant to make sure they are a good fit for your practice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Did you see the list in the drive?

> **Response 2:** Organization is key. I have them tell me specifics about how they stay organized. I will often give them a task as a test (paid for) and we'll use that to assess them.  It is usually a task that takes a good amount of organization. If they are also going to be customer facing and communicating with customers on a regular basis then I also test their their communication skills. Often I will give them a scenario and ask them to respond to a patient. It will be fake, but it lets me test what their email/phone skills are like and how they communicate and how they come off.  It also allows me to test how they do with problem solving given limited instructions.  These tasks are also timed tasks so it lets me assess their ability to meet deadlines.

**Original Post:**
Other than the obvious! and telling “caged” clinicians to become “uncaged” how can we help our fellow caged clinicians, who need a W2 job for whatever reasons?

How can we help those still in SNFs or contract rehab Co. advocate for a new healthcare bill to prevent 100% productivity, groups and concurrents to be forced upon them, to the point at which we have “Therapist & Me: Senior Nap Time 😴 groups” being paid for by Medicare! Or therapist working off the clock in droves…

Any verbiage I think of will also hurt us, who can ETHICALLY run well oiled, outcome producing, high level, outpatient groups and concurrents…

There has to be come creative way to word this bill I am envisioning to put the CARE back in SNF healthcare without hurting my fellow “uncaged” clinicians private practices. 

If this is not the place for this thread please message me and I will start a group chat

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do have an advocacy group but many in there are in the other side of the business and would not understand this question

> **Response 2:** What about a policy that states 

“
If …clinician works within the same facility that has the at least 1 of the following 3 professionals also working or contracted there:
1. Doctors
2. Nurses
3. CNAs
Or 
If…the clinician has any Med A patients on their caseload that day

Then…the CTC, SNF, or ALF shall never do the following unethical things:
1. Demand that the clinicians productivity will be above 75% billable time that day
2. Dictate which clients are placed in a group
3. Threaten the clinician with an action plan or job termination for not grouping per scheduled list or not going above 75%

This will ensure that the following will occur:
1. quality and individualized patient care 
2. non-billable discussions with the IDT
3. medically necessary groups
4. working ON the clock

**🎧 NEW PODCAST EPISODE IS LIVE!**

Ever wonder why some practices *effortlessly* attract the right people, while others feel invisible?

It’s not luck.
It’s not better marketing.
👉 It’s your **business voice.**

In this episode of The Uncaged Clinician Podcast, David Bayliff dives into:

✅ What it actually means for your business to have a voice
✅ How your values and energy speak *before* you do
✅ The REAL difference between messaging and marketing
✅ Why your voice builds trust, connection, and growth

💥 "Selling is nothing more than having a conversation and conversation is communication. Communication is a transfer of energy."

Your voice is more than what you say. It’s how people *feel* when they experience your brand.

🎙️ Tune in and start speaking the language that draws in your dream clients. [links in comments]

🚨 NEW Blog!

You ask, “What is the value of community as a business owner?” INVALUABLE.

We'll explain why.

To have a community of like minded people AND a supportive leadership team to direct you IS VITAL to a successful practice, as an owner, and you, the individual.

When you surround yourself with people who are doing what you are doing, working toward similar goals and dreams, that community of people are supportive and say, “We get it and get YOU!”

Hello everybody. 
For those that use Hellonote, do you also have a seperate card processing platform to accept payment or  do you find HN built in payment processing sufficient? I'm getting ready to kick off my mobile practice with only seeing a few patients a week. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use their built in system and am happy with it; I also just added a payment link to my website as well which seems to be helpful to clients that I send invoices to once their care is done

Hi , I am a new start up clinic based in CA . I am looking for resources to manage direct access patients. I was wondering ,
1. Can I see Medicare patient for direct access without a referral? Would appreciate practice act links on this or any other resources.
2 . Tips to ensure I receive signed POC in timely manner . Having trouble navigating through this . 
TIA !

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Medicare doesn't really care about scripts. But direct access or not, a claim must have a referring provider. This is who will sign the POC. Some clinics require a script to ensure this doctor will sign. But if audited, Medicare wants to see a signed POC. Not a script.

> **Response 2:** Curious, are you not familiar with your Practice Act, is that why you are asking someone to post a link?  Just respectfully curious??

Hello, thank u for letting me join. Thinking of pursuing  pediatric mobile PT. Do u still have to maintain notes on prvt/ cash clients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Maintaining your own notes is important for your protection and to keep track of how you progress your clients.  Plus ,you never know if your client will need some type of surgery/medical tx down the road and the MD may request it.  I had a client fall on her icey back steps and she continued to come to see me, decided to follow up w/MD, had a MRI and decided to have surgery.  The MD AND  the insurance company requested all of her notes.  Be careful, CYA.

> **Response 2:** Yes, legally I would always maintain notes, for your protection.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have this included on a group policy that I have with CM & F, they needed an underwriter to get additional information about the fitness class specifics prior to insuring but it’s all in one policy for PT and fitness services for me. 
You can also get additional exercise instruction policies from non-healthcare insurers. Nationwide, State Farm etc for 200-300 ish per year depending on your credentials and experience level.

Got this one from my sister earlier, and loved listening to it. Only 35 minutes, and much of what was said is right on target with everything the Uncaged Clinician coaches are talking about all the time!!

I also appreciated them speaking directly to women in some business contexts, but because of this group I am aware that men also struggle with some of the same things.

Answered a few questions in literally a minute and they approved me the following day..getting the card in 3-5 days. $750 cash back reward if you use $7500 of credit in first 90 days.

Ever walk into a room and suddenly feel like you don’t belong there?

Maybe it’s a networking event, a local clinic, or a conversation with another professional — and that confident version of you disappears.

You’re not alone. 

It’s what we call **The Confidence Gap** — the space between feeling *prepared* and feeling *qualified.*

Tomorrow’s UNCAGED Blog dives into why this happens and how to close that gap.

💭 Quiet the imposter voice
💪 Borrow belief when your confidence feels shaky
🚪 Walk boldly into the rooms meant for you

*You’re not underqualified. You’re just growing into your next level.*

🗓️ **New Blog drops TOMORROW:**
**“Stepping Into Rooms You Feel Underqualified For”**

Where have you been holding back because you didn’t feel “qualified enough”? 👇

Now that I’m into my second year as a cash-based practice, I am starting to branch out with some community relationships for wellness services 🙌🏼So far I am doing some pre-season assessments and a strength workshop for a high school basketball program. I may also be adding a group exercise class at a local church. 

For those of you who are more seasoned in group programs, how do you handle the admin side? From searching this group I know I would like to have a consent form, but don’t know what it needs to include. Is anyone willing to share their consent for group wellness/workshops? I am also curious whether you document these events in your clinic EMR or somewhere else. 
(Pic is of my virtual business card that I made after learning about them in this group!)

This may have been asked already - but any must knows and must not dos when approaching gyms to find a space to work out of?

I have curated a handful of local gyms/fitness centers that I am interested in pursuing a potential collab. I haven’t actually worked with them to this point, but is it appropriate to just walk in and ask if they’re interested in partnering with a physical therapist? Read a few comments in other forums saying you should already somehow be affiliated with the gym 🤔

Also - if anyone has or knows of such a space open to renting out a room/space in the Greater Philly and surround suburbs, I’d be happy to chat!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go do a trial and work out there first and see how it runs, how well the owners know the members and staff, talk to the members, etc. You definitely need to start from the inside when you are looking for a space to treat

Hi Folks! Long time follower, first time poster. I am just starting out my cash practice in a bouldering gym that is in a prime location downtown. As I was walking around the gym today I realized apt complexes have popped up everywhere! I'd imagine the demographic of these folks would be my ideal client- young, active professionals who can afford cash services. I'd love some help as to how I might connect with property managers to promote my services. Thanks!

For mobile PTs who have used Facebook ads: I dove into it a little and it appears outside of picking locations, age range and “interests” you can’t really narrow it down more than that. Not sure what interests I’d be choosing for those seeking PT. This seems more fit for selling products. Did you guys have success with only these parameters?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just let the algorithm work. Your better to just set broad targeting in a geographical location and let Facebook work its magic. Age range can be helpful but I’d still set it very broad 25-65 or something like that.  Hope that helps

Hello

For those of you who use DBA for your practice:

I created an entity (lets call it ABC Physical Therapy PLLC) and realized that there is another ABC Physical Therapy and Acupuncture PLLC in my city (I feel so embarrassed for not doing enough research on a name but I needed to create the PLLC quickly)! I did not realize that there was another practice with such similar name (only difference is they provide acupuncture services). 

I do NOT want to be associated with the other practice because they seem to run as a chain/mill. I filed for a DBA for the entity (lets call it 123 Physiotherapy) so I can use the DBA instead of the original name. 

Question:
1. For billing/superbill purposes - what do I write as the name of my practice? My NPI and EIN are associated with ABC Physical Therapy PLLC
2. How do I advertise? I would much rather everyone know my business as "123 Physiotherapy"
3. Is there anything that I should know about if I want to use my DBA instead of my original PLLC name? Is a DBA still considered a PLLC?

Thank you for all of your insight and help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In WA, I think the only time I ever see the actual business name for a different clinic I work at is on my quickbooks time sheet. Otherwise, everything is the dba. I’m sure you’ll get other answers here more thorough than mine re: billing, but all of your branding should be your dba definitely. Don’t advertise anything as the original biz title.

> **Response 2:** In Florida, everything can be done under the DBA

I was supposed to sublease a space starting next week, but the person changed their mind due to "scheduling reasons." I had found the place on a NextDoor post. Does anyone have any recommendations on finding a small space to sublease?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In my neighborhood literally any gym owner. They are selling back closets lol. Seriously though ask around to some of the gyms or wellness businesses. You don’t need much space to start and for them it’s found money. You may be able to negotiate a pretty good deal and bonus if they are a potential referral partner. Just make sure your numbers are right before getting a space. A lot goes into that

Hello! Looking for input on putting together a simple free webinar as an educational/ marketing technique to new/current clients. I'm not a tech person. Im a solopreneuer with a mobile practice.
Thinking it may be something I repeat quarterly. 
From anyone who's done this before: 
Any recs on the most simple way to do this? Or tips on making this fun, easy and successful?
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can use teachable, but if you have a wordpress website there are cheaper ways that integrate into your site. If you have a squarespace they have a course platform. But if you want to keep it super simple you can use a private free YouTube or vimeo and set up a workflow funnel....something like person clicks to get webinar, enters email, gets taken to page with webinar to watch.

**Community Responses:**

For those that rent space from a gym, do you have difficulty having your location show up in Google due to being the address of the gym and not your business?  Also do you use the gyms address or PO box?  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, it took me awhile to get verified initially. I finally tried adding a number to the suite address (we were suite b2 and I listed my address as suite b22 on Google so it was different from the other business), the verification postcard finally came and then I was able to drop the 2. I just moved to a new place inside a small gym and now I need to do a video submission to reverify 🙄

> **Response 2:** Nope. You can still register your business address with google.

I have a question on behalf of one of my friends and this group always seems to know the answer! 

He has a cash based client and the MD is in Canada. We are in Texas. Can he accept a referral from a Canadian MD or does it need to come from a MD in the US/Texas? 

Thank you in advance for any advice!!

**Original Post:**
Question for all of you Uncaged PT clinic owners. We are contemplating offering Annual Physical Therapy Evaluations for our geriatric population. The question is, if the physician request and recommends the annual exam be completed for a client to establish baseline measures and identify risk factors for future injury, are we able to submit that visit to Medicare and Medicare advantage plans for reimbursement. We are in a direct access state so we technically don’t need a physician referral to evaluate, if that matters. The annual exam would be conducted essentially as an initial evaluation as it is anticipated that nearly all of our prospective clients would have deficits and areas of concern that at the very least would warrant a HEP. Our thoughts would be to address the concerns of the client through the evaluation and bill Medicare for the evaluation. If not medically necessary to treat additionally it would be an eval only and if warranted a plan of care would be developed and physician signature would be requested before treatment began. Thoughts?

**Original Post:**
Hi everyone! I’m looking for some good advice. I have an opportunity to market at 2 senior centers on fall prevention. I’m hoping to use this opportunity to market my skills as an occupational therapist and gain Medicare patients or patients who want private pay. My practice consists of geriatric/ortho care ranging from fall prevention, stroke rehab, upper extremity, spine, and lower extremity rehab. 

I did put a disclaimer that this is for education, and shouldn’t be used as actual medical device. They would need to be evaluated first and MD refreral. 

In this presentation:
- we will go over fall risks. 
- solutions/Strategies. 
- different excercises to reduce risk of falls
-why use my company, and how I would be different from other OT/PT companies. 
-anything else you would reccomend?

My questions are following:

1. Since I have 1 hour with the facility and their members, what’s important to target?

2. When would it be best to market my company?

3. Anything I should bring as a thank you? I will be bringing buisness cards 

4. How do I market myself in a way where I’m guaranteed these potential clients become actual clients? Any suggestions or tips that worked for you?

If I can get at least 2 of the 20-60 members joining I’d be happy. 

I’m in network with Medicare only, and cash pay for other Commercial insurances. 

Thank you and serious responses only please!

Question re: Part A services. If a client is getting Part A for PT, does that prohibit Part B for OT? My understanding is yes because the PT is claiming that the client is home-bound to require these services. Is this correct?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are correct.

> **Response 2:** The patient has to be completely discharged from all part A services in order to begin part B. This includes wound care and any other medical or home health aide. And I would even wait another 24 hours after the date on the discharge in order to resume services through part B. Don’t overlap!￼

Anyone ever develop a relationship with an area school district? I'm thinking of reaching out to an athletic director to possibly provide free injury screens. I have not been able to find out if the school district employs an athletic trainer though. If they do not have an athletic trainer, or only have one for events, it could be beneficial for both me and the school.  I am not an athletic trainer (anymore anyway, I purposely let the certification lapse and never licensed in my state because I wasn't using it and don't want to work strictly as an athletic trainer). 
I'm hoping it'll be a way to get my name out in the community. 
If you have done something similar, how did it look for you? Did you create a formal relationship, or just an informal one?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Best of luck! Where I am the hospital system places the ATC in the schools and supplies the MDs as well and they try to keep the PT in house so no one can get involved with any high school outside of the hospital system, so club sports is where all the marketing efforts go… hopefully it’s different in your area!

Hi everyone. Love this group and all of the community here. Our company is coming up on year 2 of business (solopreneur + hubby who does personal training and just recently hired another PT) and I’m starting to want to do more streamlined holiday gifts for my long term clients. 

Does anyone know an economical way to get logo stickers and decent water bottles in bulk? 

Water bottles seem a little basic but I actually specialize in working with several groups of folks who often are dehydrated so I think my clients would really like them (older adults, busy moms, hot yoga practitioners, and folks with dysautonomia).

Hi all I’m new here and first time posting a question, but I’m starting a cash pay PT clinic within a CrossFit gym. It’ll actually be a service offered by the CrossFit gym — so it’ll be part of the umbrella company that the gym is under… 

I’m located in TN and was wondering the following:

What are the laws in TN surrounding practicing in a gym setting as it relates to advertising? Also as it relates to you being a W2 employee.

Owner questions regarding PT practice setup:

Do we (Magnistrength LLC/DBA Full Steam CrossFit) need some kind of license as a business to allow you to practice and advertise your services?

Do I need specific insurance to add or is there insurance you can pick up to practice independently? 

Thank you 🙏

Use initials or have them sign  a HIPAA release form for marketing/social media purposes.

I focus on geriatrics so I primarily have networked towards case management/social workers as well as home health companies that have patients who want additional care.

Hi all... Talk to me about having your own office space.

I currently do social and Sensory groups for kids and I "rent out" rooms at various kid locations (about $50 for each hour of use and I do about 5-6 groups a week as of right now) 

I personally feel like this way works because I am not "tied" down to an actual monthly rent and maintenence fees. But then on the flip side, I feel like I have to ask permission for use and I'm thinking "rent" for my own space may even be less if I continue to do multiple groups a day. I see some similar businesses like mine with their own office and I wonder how they are even doing it (cost wise).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I see kids and lease a space. I found a space that is not storefront and not “medical”. That helps when looking for something affordable. But I also share this space with an OT (I’m PT). So we share costs but are separate businesses.

> **Response 2:** Following.

I plan to do group meet ups once I settle in as a mobile peds PT. My initial plan is to rent spaces for the meet ups and once I have enough clients I’ll rent a space, essentially for a clinic and the social groups.

Hello, I just wanted to confirm for Georgia practice requirements—do we need to have the plan of care signed by the referring doctor, or is it not required within the direct access period? It has been very time consuming with too much follow-up from the doctor’s office, so I wanted to be sure of the requirement. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** POC or referral?

If insurance based then some insurance require a referral regardless.

Direct access prior to needing a referral is 21 days and/or 8 visits. Which ever comes first.

A POC does not need to be signed during this time, but a referral is needed for continuation outside of this time frame. Depending on how the POC is written, it can count as a prescription/referral to continhe therapy when signed.

Has anyone advertised with Spotify? I would love to hear if you find it valuable and worth it? 
I have a call tomorrow with rep.

Follow up After call: 

Actually it seems very easy and runs similar to FB ads. It’s bizarre that my teen asked me on Monday to check into it and then I had an email about it randomly on Tues. 
it’s great because you have the option of doing video audio and display ads, you can run a series of ads and they have AI to help you design them for free. For the audio, you can write your own information and then choose to record it yourself or choose a voice to record it and tell it the tone of voice you want and then they send it back to you and you say yes or no if you like it or what how you wanna tweak it if it’s actually very interesting then the only thing you pay for is your ads and just like Facebook you tell them how much you wanna spend or how many people you wanna hit in the age group and the territorythings like that I think I’m going to give it a try

Anyone have success with facebook ads? I'm trying to run a really cheap add. It's for an upcoming course i'm teaching and was just trying to dabble with ads a bit. 

I'm really frustrated. 
My add says it's active but it's not showing any action or pulling from my billing.  

I then somehow turned off the add, turned it back on but the delivery section says off... 

I feel like it should be easier than this. haha

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Whenever I hear people say their dashboard is not showing anything, it's because they forgot to update the date. I see that the latest date in the image is June 13, 2025, so select June 14 as the latest day of the calendar.

I found running FB ads with a really cheap budget will only bring in low-quality leads because there are so many people bidding and targeting the same type of audience so the budget of $30 lifetime won’t win high-quality traffic. 

Start with $30 per day if the course is mid ticket, if it’s high ticket, then start with $50-$100 per day depending on the price point.

Anyone have a good referral program they use to bring in new clients? Taking any and all suggestions- I just hired and want to fill schedules. My clients are great cheerleaders for me so I’d like to give them simple ways to keep my practice top of mind & refer easy!

Hello group, I am working out a lease of a space in a local gym my husband and I are members of. My focus area will be an overhead athlete. A town over is a PT who owns his own gym and provides cash based 1:1 services with a focus on weight lifting athlete. He has been open for quite some time now and comes to our gym to hold workshops to gain clientele. How do I go about keeping a professional relationship with him? I feel like we best stick together? However, I do fear as being viewed as an unwanted competition? Any thoughts on this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I personally would just reach out and introduce yourself!  I have only found friendship and encouragement in doing so with other cash based PTs in my area. (With one exception of someone who just never would reply, but it didn’t hurt me to reach out).

Yes, we are “competitors,” however I have given and received referrals from all of them bc we each know our specialties and all want our populations to be served as best as possible (even when it’s with another clinician).

Community education is a huge part of my mission/passion and where I find that I am able to market my practice best. 

I work with female athletes - majority are lifters, group fitness participants, runners, and triathletes. 

I want to generate some new relationships with running and tri clubs and other group fitness classes in the area with the goal of being able to offer their participants/members free education/screens (and then hopefully my paid services ☺️). 

What have you done to introduce yourself to athletic communities that has worked? Especially those who don’t know of you yet. What have you tried that you wouldn’t do again?

How many of you have built a brand new house? 🤔

Would you ever lose patience with the builders and tell them to speed through setting the proper foundation?

Heck no! Because you know that you would have to go back years later and fix it…and that can be even more costly! 💵 

You would tell them to take their time on the foundation, right? 

You would want them to make sure that the foundation is sturdy, right?

Our businesses should not be treated any differently!

If you are needing to build the proper foundation, our Business Launchpad program that launches again next week was built with that exact purpose in mind.

I'm in upstate NY in a very rural community. Any insight on what insurances are worth going in network with? I was hoping to be in network with medicaid/medicare due to the population im serving but with some research I'm rethinking that..

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Katelyn Ann if you know any local PT providers you can ask them. Ive had some luck when i was in that phase just asking to see who in my area had the best rates or were worth participating In network. Some of the rates were so low with certain plans i decided to stay out because id have to see 3 patients at that rate to make it worthwhile. 
Hope this helps.

How often do I need to request a new PT script? If a patient needs more PT after their certification period is over (plan of care expires), I always write a full recertification note which gets faxed over to their physician and I get it signed in return.

Question: when you find yourself with extra time for “work” what do you dedicate towards time to, that seems to really push the needle forward in the success of your business? Is it content creation? Systems and process? Marketing? I realize it’s different for everyone depending on the day but just curious as to what is everyone’s “go to” is when they want to get more people in the door and it doesn’t involve adding more people to your schedule THAT day ? TIA!

Back in the early days it would have been physician marketing. These days it is more content generation.

Is there anyone that solely (or primarily) treats via telemedicine? I’m interested in growing this ￼platform for my vestibular practice (I’m mobile and do see some telemedicine) but struggling with:

1. Selling clients that telehealth can have huge benefits despite its drawbacks (obviously its not appropriate for everyone, but I’ve seen huge success with it)

2. Generating leads. I really rely on in person events and meeting with other small business for referrals. Do people rely heavily on their website or social media for growing virtual clients? What kind of platforms are you using to get leads?

My reach can be broader via telemedicine, I can reduce my driving radius, and open my schedule up to see and help more people so it’s really appealing to me. 
Any other tips? Thanks ☺️

It’s the 4th quarter of this year. You have the ball as a new biz owner…

𝐃𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐨 𝐰𝐢𝐧?

Guys like Tom Brady trust their coach and the game plan so much, that all the team has to do is just put the ball in their hands, and magic seems to happen. 

Does Tom Brady have a coach of his own? Of course he does.

As a business coach, there is one sentence that can be told to me in any area of life, and I will in secret, know that person to be a fool. 

Now, I know in our culture, calling someone a “fool” may sound harsh, but the definition is simply “a person who acts unwisely.”

That one sentence is “I can figure it out on my own.”

The Bible says in Proverbs 12:15 - “The way of the fool seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.”

Do people like Tom Brady try to figure it out on their own? Nope.

So why would it make sense for you to do so as a business owner?

We have helped over 400 clinicians to become Uncaged from corporate healthcare. We can help you too. 

We are dedicating this month of September to helping 10 more practice owners in this group (at a significant discount, your welcome 🙏) to give you the gameplan and confidence to go win in this 4th quarter.

It will set you up for massive amounts of MOMENTUM in your business moving into 2023.

If you are ready to get the help that you need to grow your business, comment “Give me the ball” 🏈 below 👇 and I’ll send you all of the details!

Hello,

I am a PT in CA, with a small practice, hybrid, cash and medicare. Many of my clients have been going to IV clinics as one of them mentioned it be great if we offer that. I didnt say much at the time or put too much though in to it, since that is outside my score of practice. 

Would that still be possible if I had an RN administer the IVs and had a physician remotely approve and clear patients. I read online, that a physician had to be 51% owner of a facility providing IV. I could be wrong. Just wondering if anyone in this group has done that.

I ask because I have seen multiple IV clinics where there is no physician, or physician owned either.

Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used to work for a chiro clinic in CA that offers IVs. I'm 99% positive it is solely owned by the chiro.

Pediatric COTA here with a BA in psych and extensive training in Executive functioning 

Looking to work remotely doing parent coaching , executive functioning coaching & looking to get into being an educational advocate 

Where / how do you market especially for remote work

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you looking to start your own business or you want someone to hire you for those tasks? 

If you’re running your own business you can create a website and at least static social media pages (rather than worrying about posting all the time) 

Create an opt-in so people can join your email list, then a welcome/nurture/sales sequence that sends out after they join your list. 

Then you have to get traffic/get noticed. 

You can use SEO, paid ads, active social media accounts, podcasts, YouTube, etc. But you have to get in front of your ideal clients, have a solution to their problem, and establish that you’re *the* place they need to come for solutions. 

It’s a lot of groundwork to get started, but doable! 

You can’t sell “executive function coaching” or “parent coaching” though… you have to sell a transformation and the solution to the problem. The coaching is just the vehicle that gets them there. 

Like selling a trip to Hawaii. You’re not selling the airplane, you’re selling the destination. 😉 

Screen Time Clinic was helping people get started with parent/family coaching around digital wellness at one point. I’m not sure if they still are, but you could contact them. I think they were doing a monthly fee for a certification and being listed on their website/getting marketing materials and support from them. But you’d still be running your own business and getting clients.

Just a share post… In my state without direct access… that some physicians argue against every year, they don’t even have time to sign our paperwork… let alone review it. Talk about wild. When you’ve got busy clinics with assistants signing for the doctors/professionals (you’ve heard)… Sounds okay right… Even with the help they can still take a month sometimes to return anything signed… It’s another day in crazy land. I’ve got to help fight for this direct access around here. Make it make sense.

Do I need a script from the physician PRIOR to EVALUATING a client paying privately? How about a client who is a Medicare beneficiary?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Everyone needs a signed POC to treat a Medicare patient, regardless of your state’s direct access rules. It sounds like I’m your state, you will need a referral or signed POC to treat a private pay patient but typically you don’t need it for the evaluation. So you can send the eval to the MD for a signature and then you are good to treat once you get it back.

Hi,
Looking to get some advice on resources for placing hiring ads that don’t cost an arm and a leg.

I’ve tried word of mouth and the free indeed ads but have t gotten anywhere.

Also

Looking to hear what some successful marketing strategies within the mobile cash based early intervention and body work areas have been.

Thanks!

Hey everyone! 

I hope you're all doing well! 🌟 I’m the founder and a Speech-Language Pathologist at Brainstorm Speech Therapy. I've been working on a master sheet to gather potential pediatric providers for referrals and collaborations, and I’d love your help!

I’m reaching out to pediatricians, dentists, ENTs, PTs, OTs, SLPs, psychologists, social workers, pediatric nurses, play therapists, music therapists, chiropractors, art therapists, daycares, family services such as interpreters and more to join in on this initiative.

I truly believe this could be an amazing resource for both providers and families in our community. 

Check out the Google sheet below! Feel free to add your information or share it with your contacts. I can't wait to collaborate and support our DMV families together. (DC, MD, VA)

Thanks a bunch for your time!

Are there any PT recruiters I can talk to to help find me a PT? Is that a thing? I know there are physician recruiters all over the place.

Also where all do you post for job postings? I know indeed is big. But I don’t know if many other good places I can post.

Two questions related to marketing: 

Emails/newsletters - how often do you send these out to your list?  Do you find the time spent to create the content worthwhile to the growth of your business? 

Social media - how often do you post per week? And if you have someone who manages your social media, how often are they posting for you per week? Do you find a social media manager to be a worthwhile investment?   

For reference I am a solo provider, cash practice in women’s health targeting female athletes.

Hi everyone! I’m gearing up to start my own business this fall and getting excited. I’m going to offer pelvic floor PT at ppl’s homes and set up in a gym for ortho. For those of yall that practice in a gym, do you have your own private space or do you work in a corner of the gym? I’d prefer private space but I haven’t been able to find many local gyms with that option so far so I’m curious on how ppl set their table up. Thanks!

Hey guys, what are some collaboration ideas that you have found beneficial for both parties when working with a gym? I am a clinic director for a private owned outpatient practice, and we are right next door to a pretty successful, private owned gym. We have discussed 1 month free off a 6 or 12 month membership if we refer them to the gym, and have also toyed with the idea of going over and providing dry needling/IASTM just to get hands on some people, but I’m not sure how beneficial that is to my clinic. Just want the door to be open both ways, so all ideas are welcome! Thanks 🙂

Hello everyone!

I’ve been given the opportunity to begin a small cash pay side hustle! However I have a question about specific logistics, legality, if this is actually possible to do, and if anyone could just give me some general guidance on this! Also I am in a direct access state with no limitations. Context of the opportunity below!

—opportunity for one day a week rent out and use space within a high school with access to their training room and weight room for equipment while treating athletes and staff of that high school and other neighboring school district athletes. 

—it is a small rural community with no athletic trainer involved in the community or other neighboring communities-so I wouldn’t be invading anyone’s space or taking away from their job/scope of practice.

Do you identify as a Neuro PT and practice in the U.S.? If so, please consider completing this survey on Neuro PT leadership practices:

Additionally, if you practice in a clinic that includes or exclusively provides health promotion & wellness/fitness programing for people with neurologic diagnoses, this research also seeks to describe these program characteristics so that we can collaborate in bridging the gap between rehab and wellness/fitness for people with neurologic disability. If we don't know what's out there, we can't connect and work together to meet the needs of our patients. Thank you so much, and please share with a friend! Want to know more, catch me on the "I love neuro" podcast next week, or message me to connect at CSM!

HAPPY PT MONTH!! COLORADO PT/PTAs FYI: Every third Thursday of the month, at 6:15pm, PTs and PTAs throughout Colorado meet via Zoom for an hour informational/educational program.

2 questions- Please read both! 

Any OT’s in Arkansas? I have some questions about direct access/ telehealth? 

Also question to any OT/ PTs; I’m licensed in 2 states both those states have direct access for evaluations and then POC needs to be sent to MD; what happens when they have a functional medicine practitioner or no provider at all because they are holistic? 

Right now I have been saying no due to license; but just learned of a sleep study company that a md will sign the order for a fee? This sounds unethical. But I’ve also thought of starting a coaching…but ethically I can’t find the line between coaching and therapy. [but then I look at what my patients bring back from instagram and tick tok from professionals and non professionals] just trying to find a ethical way to treat holistically and my holistic patients that are no traditional or western medicine. 
( also I say OT and PT because SLP doesn’t have this in my state; it’s only for insurance) I’m private pay only. 
Thanks for any insight!

I rent space with a CrossFit gym. I am thinking of doing a small flyer for them to give to their members about my services and like an intro session. Should I provide a free session or discount first session to get them in the door? If anyone done a flyer, can you share it with me? They will put these in their new client's folders.

🚨 **InBody 570 Available – Perfect for Clinics Looking to Add Objective Data to Client Care!** 🚨

I’m transitioning my career path and looking to find a new home for my InBody 570. Many of you know how powerful this tool is — it goes beyond the scale by giving clients detailed body composition data (muscle, fat, water balance, visceral fat levels, etc.).

✨ Why it’s awesome for your practice:
* Builds client buy-in with objective, trackable results
* Creates easy opportunities for progress check-ins and follow-ups
* Adds value to your current services while differentiating you from competitors
* Clients LOVE seeing tangible numbers that validate their hard work

👉 Retail cost on a new InBody 570 is around $12,000, and I’m asking $8,000 for mine (in great condition, 3 years old).

If you’re interested (or know another clinician who might be), shoot me a message and I’d be happy to chat details!

I’m getting a lot of VIP referrals from my previous hospital employer. If their family members need treated for example or benefactors to the hospital need treated their physicians are referring out to my independent company. We also get referrals that are Medicare beneficiaries. We just have particular specialties that can’t be found within the hospital system so they refer out to us. We also get Referrals if the patient is outside of their typical hospital providers geographical location.

￼￼ we currently have a waitlist and all my therapist are at capacity, I’m actively looking for more therapist to join the team. 

My question is… Has anyone entered into a service retainer agreement with a referral partner where I could offer 4 to 5 spots a month for the hospital’s VIP clients? The client would not pay but the hospital would pay a retainer my company with a promise that we would provide access and treatment within 72 hours of a referral. ￼ More benefits would be included in the partnership. Of course, I can talk to my business attorney about legalities, but wondered if anyone has ever contemplated this. Thank you ￼

What if a child has no medical diagnosis and parents want help with picky eating? Or sleep hygiene or hyperactivity etc etc. Also can we evaluate without a referral?

**Original Post:**
Hi all, I'm a PT in California new to the private practice world, and I have some questions about direct access in a cash pay setting. My understanding per California law is that I need to do all of the following: 
- notify the patients that they can be seen for 12 sessions or 45 days, whichever comes first, after which we need a signed plan of care
- notify the treating physician that the patient is receiving care (requiring the signed written consent from the patient to reach out to their physician)
- and, if beyond the 45 day / 12 visit limit, get a signed and dated plan of care 

As a one-man show the prospect of having to track down PCPs to sign plans of care for patients seems like it's going to add a lot of admin time. 

Here are my questions:
* Do all practices really do this - specifically the notices? I've been to a PT before myself and I don't recall getting notified of this, though I'm sure there was stuff on the back end I didn't see
* What qualifies as "wellness"? Because wellness visits don't seem to fall under this requirement, what differentiates a wellness visit from normal PT?
* I know a lot of folks don't have established PCPs. Is there any way around this requirement for a signed plan of care if the patient doesn't have an MD etc available to evaluate them?

Thanks for any advice

PSA....  Phishing scam alert: 
I have had 2 in the last few months. This morning I got an email supposedly from my independent contractor who I pay direct deposit through quickbooks. Posed as her saying that she had changed her deposit bank account and needed to know how to update that for all future payments. It was obviously not her email and the wording was very generic.
A few months ago I received one from a "French PT" who had a client visiting the area for the summer and wanted to know if I could see their patient for back pain a few times/week. This would not be super unusual because I am in a resort area. They even took a bunch of descriptors from my website and included them to sound legit. I pointed them to my online booking site and then they replied asking if I would take a check from the person's manager and refund whatever funds I did not need.
I am a super small business and am frankly surprised that they found me and are putting energy into it. If they are finding me - they can find you (if you have a business website). Stay alert.

- how hot it will be in the summer, no AC
- getting some patients up the stairs if they have an injury.

Hey everyone! I’m a PT in the St. Louis area currently working in outpatient ortho. I’m looking to start seeing some patients on the side in the golf/rock climbing niches and eventually go fully cash-based once I build up a client base. I’m wondering if it would be more advantageous to focus on one niche since they’re very different? Or would it be manageable to do both? Still considering mobile vs. working out of a gym if this helps. I’m very early on in the planning phases of building a business, and I’d love to chat with any like-minded folks that might have advice. Thanks!

Can someone help clarify for me what the guidelines/laws are in states that don’t have direct access or limited direct access in regards to MD scripts? For example I treat mainly autistic children so they typically have Medicaid, but I just recently had one age out and the parents want to continue therapy. I work in GA, but am a new grad so I’m not eligible for direct access. How often do I have to get an MD signature? Before, since this patient fell under Medicaid I was able to do an eval that lasted one year and just do a progress report at the 6 month mark. Is it still the same or shorter now? Any help is much appreciated, because the biller we use at my work told me I don’t need a signed POC at all, but I know I do since I can’t see patients through direct access.

Also if not this type of advertising, how are you guys doing social media like fb and IG? I know that's the way to go but in San Diego, I previously had a high no-show rate with this type of refer base. So doesn't someone have a good social media expert in the socal area?

I'm pretty sure I've made a mistake. I recertified a medicare B patient at the end of the cert period (90 days) instead of the end of the frequency (8 weeks). Is this a problem? 
If it is a problem, my plan is to create a recert note dated when the 8 weeks was up, add on a late certification letter, then send that to the referring MD for signature. Will that work or is there a better way? Thanks for any help.

I started seeing my first patient last week (yay!). The patient has a Medicare advantage plan, and I called and verified everything, set the copay, etc. There is "no referral needed" per the plan. Does this mean that I technically don't need a POC signed by the MD if I'm in a direct access state? Or just that I don't need the MD to document an actual referral to me?

Hi,
I recently left a large hospital group (OP ortho) for a smaller private practice and now the smaller practice is having trouble getting referrals and new patients. There was no noncompetes to my knowledge so the practice is within a 20 mile radius of where my old work was. 

I had a pretty good working relationship with some of the hospital physicians (where we got our referrals from)- would it be inappropriate to reach out/market with them and let them know where I’ve gone? Has anyone reached out to physicians via Linked In?

Thank you!!

I wasn’t sure if I try to do CAQH for my practice it would mess up credentials/billing with hospital and my practice. Thank you!

Any PTs in East Texas (Tyler/Mineola area) or any connections/providers in that area? I have family in the area who may need services soon.

I searched the group but couldn't find anything current: But those that use HN, do you use Clover connect to collect payments? 
If so thoughts? Any hidden costs one should take into account?
If not- what do you use to collect CC payments?

Has anyone established an partnership with a much larger entitiy before? I’ve been working on a business proposal to break out of traditional healthcare but to secure funding and a large network of resources my idea is to join forces with a similiar but different company. 

I’d be part owner of the cash based PT business, which is still better than under appreciated pizza eating employee. I don’t know where to start on the structure of the partnership, silent partner versus general partnerships, type of lawyers to seek out if I get to the paperwork stage 

Any and all advice appreciated

Anyone do memberships not in a group setting? Like x amount per month and you get x private sessions per month. Something along those lines
If so, do you have a lot of people who take advantage of it?

I heard this podcast today and really found it insightful. Something I have been missing, but pretty sure it relates to Josh Paynes talk at UCLive. Build your peer group!!!

I am hosting an open house and tying it to a non-profit fundraiser.  I need a VA who can do the following:

I need a VA to create an invitation in CANVA with links to register to attend.  It will need links to Active Campaign to add people in the Campaign to get reminders.  This invitation can then be posted in my Private Facebook group, on my google business page and on my personal Facebook group.
I want to be able to email the invitation from my personal email to other tennis players I know and post in other Facebook tennis groups with permission.
I want to allow a link to purchase raffle tickets in the invitation for people who want to contribute but cannot attend the event?  Therefore, I will need it to link to square and give option for purchaser to pay processing fees.

Can anyone help with this?
