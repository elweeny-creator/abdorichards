What’s the best way to let this person know they can’t advertise “physical therapy services” without being a PT?  And really that physical therapy is a profession and not a service…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a chiropractor he can likely bill PT codes, so he’s likely not violating any rules. 

Also, it’s better to just be good enough at what you do that people start to say you’re better than PT. 😉

> **Response 1:** Legit question Chelsea. I've been getting paid oon from Humana and then all of a sudden they denied the succeeding visits. Does that happen all the time? Or just depends on their plan?

Give me all of your tax write-offs that I may not be thinking of.  

Learned just the other day we can write off our CC processing fees.  Wish I knew that for the past 5 years 😣

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a list.  I’ll share it in a bit!

> **Response 2:** Any cost of doing business is fair game. Home office, mileage, software, equipment, depreciation, etc. If you must pay for it to serve your clients it’s a write off. The more I can stick it to the IRS crooks the better! Hell my next trip overseas I’ll be writing off as client relations since I’ll be visiting some of the people I’ve helped!

Warning: this is just a rant. Not necessary looking for advice. 

We have built a very strong, mobile practice, have two full-time therapists with full caseload and two per diem therapists with partial caseloads. I also have a Clinic where we see individuals one on one. We average between 70-90 visits per week. 

But at the end of the day, the bank account is always drained. We feel we are experts, dealing with insurance as we have been doing it for several years. But there’s always denials, hours on the phone with insurance companies, massively delayed reimbursements due to those denials. 

On top of that, we have deductible season that comes around, patients fail to notify of new insurances, not all secondary cover the Medicare B deductible (then we have our handful of patients that say “ oh wait I have a third insurance”) leaving us to figure out how the heck to bill that coinsurance to them. 

We have people with two insurances, whose benefits are not coordinated, with the secondary making it impossible for us to correctly bill them. 

￼￼ combine that with therapists wanting top dollar even though reimbursements continue to decline per unit…

With all of this being said, I truly thought building this big independent one-on-one practice was going to be a life changer financially, and all that has happened. Is that more money transfers through my hands, but is not building in any account. 

Has anyone just packed it up realizing they would save more by having a regular job with a savings plan? The steadiness of the same exact paycheck every two weeks? 

I don’t think I’m there yet, and I don’t think I could actually go back to working for someone. But this thing really wears on us I feel.  

Rant over!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks everyone! I want to be clear. It seemed like we did very well when it was just me! Then I scaled and all heck broke loose. Just so many expenses.

Glad to know im not the only one who has experienced this!

> **Response 2:** I hear you.  This is why I went cash. It’s the only way.  Even with cash, I still struggle looking at the bank account every month but I’m still building.  

We HAVE to cut out insurance because they are ruining our profession. If enough of us leave… maybe one day they will end up paying for our services again 🤷🏽‍♀️

APTA has introduced bipartisan Medicare Opt-Out legislation in the House of Representatives. Here is the position paper, more to come soon on what you can do to support:
"Medicare Patient Choice Act"


**Community Responses:**

HELP! Hello all, as i get closer to starting up and becoming Uncaged I still have one major road block that I need to figure out. Health insurance… I want my wife to work part time and be home more often with our daughter. I would have to provide our benefits. Many have mentioned Christian Healthcare Ministries, however unless you have $1000+ claim, it seems it won’t be covered. How do those with CHM afford basic MD visits for colds, viruses, physicals, etc? For those who don’t and got their own insurance, can you recommend other options?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There’s MediShare and Christian Health Ministries also

> **Response 2:** You basically have threechoices.  Go with Indemnity plans like CHM which provide mostly just catastrophic coverage or go with an HMO with better coverage but fewer network options or a PPO with the best coverage, lower copays etc. But highest premiums.

How many of y’all offer programs like this? 

This guy is a personal trainer and has done courses with ATG training - Ben Patrick. 

If he’s selling a program for $249 for people to “fix their knees” why aren’t we?!? Why are we getting so fixated on PT versus Wellness and what we are “allowed” to do.

Just food for thought. Any thoughts or feedback from the group? I’m truly curious about responses to this….

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My cousin is a local physician who reminds me daily we are in “the United States of America” and people are allowed to but any part of your knowledge they can afford.

> **Response 2:** I have a whole wellness and recovery center integrated with my PT practice. I offer Whole Body Cryotherapy, Whole Body Red Light Therapy, Compression Therapy, and Local Cryotherapy. All services that people are fine paying cash for and know insurance won't cover any of it. Focusing on just insurance or just standard PT is becoming more of a losing battle. I'd say everyone should try to diversify with offerings that are not PT. Open up your funnel to more of the population

Hi everyone! I opened my new brick and mortar location few weeks ago. It’s a lot smaller than my previous one but perfect for my clientele. I am grateful for the guidance I get from your posts as well as motivation to keep going after my dream. 

Engram Therapy and Wellness Clinic provides physical therapy, wound care, and lymphedema services in Chicago and suburbs. It’s a hybrid private practice and I am credentialed with Medicare B, and BCBS only. I also offer self pay and wellness services such as massage, Manual Lymphatic Drainage for lymphedema and post op surgical procedures, and sports training. 

Thank you again for your support! Jessica Kerr Sarah Zera Karrie Eder-Stanley

…. Ridiculous

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Healthcare needs an overhaul. This is why so many Doctors, therapists, and other clinicians are opting out of insurance

> **Response 2:** This is exactly why I had to let go of insurance in my neuro clinic. There is no possible way to get people what they deserve and get awesome results under an insurance company providing 10-20 visits for the year. The decision wasn’t easy as it kept me up at night. 😭

Exposure. No one can really be serious. it’s been 24 hours. My guess was 625 the first day. This is how many people have signed requesting APTA help intervene (this one specifically UHC) with fraudulent insurance companies. This is EXACTLY what I ran into filing my class action wage labor suits. 95% complained and whined and only 8.5% signed on once I filed and 97% had the audacity to TAKE their overtime and attempt to thank me after they shot me down with filing 🤣🤣🤣 (I can’t repeat what I responded to them here). Can’t complain AND not do anything. That doesn’t mix well.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't think a lot of ppl know about the petition to sign it. I think Cigna through ASH and Aetna through Holista is doing the same as is UHC through Optum.

> **Response 2:** Kim I just signed and shared. Thanks!

Great idea for anyone afraid to start. I found out this morning my state, Illinois on average for a facility that accepts Medicaid has a wait list of 1300 patients, approximately 8 to 9 months 
To be seen for ￼for physical therapy. Start here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not worth the money for medicaid unfortunately

> **Response 2:** My experience from working in an insurance based hospital network outpatient facility: Medicaid patients were the most likely to no-show (and you cannot charge them a no show fee). So I think that unless the patient is especially motivated, you may still end up “twiddling your fingers”. 
In my state, there is a protracted process to get Medicaid auth after eval (front desk always had to spend hours on the phone tracking these down each week), and they took about 2 weeks to come through. And on top of it, we had to send physical (hard copy) paper work into the state to get these approvals. 
Yes, it’s important for them to get affordable healthcare but I think that our services being essentially free for the patient meant there was less “skin in the game” for them. 
They are a population that deserves to be served but unfortunately it is just not feasible for some of us to serve them and still make a living. For a small, single practitioner office, it just doesn’t work.

So for all those that think PTs, PTAs, OTs, OTAs, and billers do not go to jail and that it must be okay because we got paid and everyone does it, you might want to google search Hertel and Brown case. 20 therapists, assistants, and billers indicted plus the company. 17 of the PTs, PTAs, and billers, including the 2 owners, have now pled guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud.

The 2 owners will receive a 6-year prison sentence in federal prison followed by 3 years of supervised release. Essentially, their careers are over. Other 15 have sentences scheduled in May, June, and July.

The other 3 have jury selection start tomorrow. 

This is why documentation, CPT coding, billing, etc., should be mandatory CEU requirements for all therapists and assistants.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So, they did things that we all know are wrong? Right?

> **Response 2:** Scary!! Reading one of the articles is says they billed for services not provided and billed as if provided by a PT when a tech provided. I hope no one here is doing these things!! Great reminder to document what you do and charge for what you do

So PT can’t accept cash from a Medicaid patient if they want more services but they can pay a diatician??    🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Logic??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Stupid law, but the whole point of Medicaid is financial assistance. If they can afford to private pay for any clinician, they probably need to get off Medicaid. At least, that's how the government sees it. I know it's more complicated than that.

> **Response 2:** If  Medicare is primary insurance and Medicaid secondary, you can not balance bill the patient if you are not a Medicaid provider. You have to follow Medicare billing rules for non covered services (ABN, still bill MC, etc) if what you provide is not covered by MC.
However, if your patient is not Medicare recipient and has only Medicaid, then ability to charge cash for PT is state specific. I am in Florida.I called and emailed to the Florida Medicaid and was told that I can collect cash for PT services if I am not a Medicaid provider.

My boys (12 and 10) are w-2 employees of my mobile PT biz. I pay them to load unload my car. I received a notice from the state asking to disclose my workers comp insurance. 

I don’t have WC insurance.

Do i need WC insurance?

I’m in pennsylvania

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d also be concerned about child labor laws for “employees” of that age! 😱In addition to the need for WC insurance for W2 employees. I do not know what the laws in PA are, but would advise you to investigate that!

Posting a pic of our general PNL for last 3 years. Sole owner with 
$350k salary, nearly ZERO clinical role and working "on" the business approximately 15hrs per week.
Revenue will likely see another 25-30% growth for 2024.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Awesome, how is your patient-staffing ratio? Would you mind sharing ratio of clinicians to support staff? Daily-weekly productivity stds? Billing in-house?

> **Response 2:** Is your main focus getting clients in the door as commercial/medicare and then converting to cash continuity programs? I'm considering doing hybrid as well but not sure how to go about starting out since I'm not currently affiliated with any Medicare or commercial insurance. Struggling with leads as a solely cash Mobile practice.

Hello there! I want to be uncaged but currently don’t have the brain power or time to do so…  (mom of a 3 yo and 9 month twins). Can someone shed some light on the whole “you can’t provide therapy services under cash pay because they’re billable to Medicare” thing? Do I have that concept wrong? I see people offering “wellness” rather than therapy. 

If the above is how it works, aren’t you by default not providing skilled therapy covered by Medicare if you’re not documenting your services? There is no skill of a therapist if there is no documented skill of a therapist, and no physician signed POC right? What am I missing here or do I have it all wrong? 

Thanks for helping me out if you can. I have a few clients in home health that told me they’d hire me if I started my own practice, but there is absolutely so much I don’t know and I don’t have the time to figure it all out 😅 I’ve just been lurking in here trying to slowly glean information and wrap my head around this concept. Thanks 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great question Veronica Erlenbush, and let’s get some clarity here. The reason why most PT’s say that you cannot charge cash for Medicare beneficiaries is due to the Meidcare Mandatory Claims Submission Rule. Meaning, if it is skilled PT that Medicare covers, it is mandatory that we submit a claim. Where it gets tricky, is if you have literally no relationship with Medicare, there is no way for you to submit a claim. Here is where it gets confusing: If there is no way to technically submit a claim online, but it’s still mandatory for you to do it as a non-participating provider……you can now understand why this is talked about so much lol. Here is where I can give you clarity: Medicare does define wellness as essentially skilled care for the patient. So, if it is unskilled like simple strengthening and endurance, technically that is NOT covered UNLESS a pre-qualifying injury or hospitalization takes place. See where I’m going here? So, if a Medicare aged client is seeking you out for general strengthening and well-being and they aren’t being treated for a specific injury or disorder, you can have them sign a Medicare beneficiary form decided under their own free will to pay you out-of-pocket for wellness services.

I know it’s a mess. Honestly, I’m with PT’s who have battled this and called it unconstitutional. They have created a monopoly essentially. 

I believe the only true loophole left, is if they are truly wellness (which the funny thing is that’s about 90% of HH clients I have seen after they have been discharged from therapy). Then, as long as they are deciding under their own free will because they want to get stronger and pay you, technically they can.

You just have to be okay with some physical therapists saying it’s “risky”. I believe Medicare has struck immense levels of fear into our profession to try to make sure they keep their monopoly in place.

But, if a Medicare aged client who doesn’t need skilled therapy comes to me and wants to get stronger to age better, I’ll see them 10 out of 10 times.

> **Response 2:** As a parent, I'll give you parent version.  You can't take cash from medicare patient for what would be something medicare pays for.  If you a rehabbing a post op knee, can't do it, but if you are keeping them from having pain while playing golf (not a covered service by Medicare) you can.

Today's ChatGPT hack:

I take a patient's initial subjective history as it comes. My sentences are choppy, out of order, and often have typos. The story is there, but I wouldn't want to be the one who has to read it. 😂

Today, as part of finishing my documentation, I asked ChatGPT to take my jumbled mess and restructure it in a narrative format to make more sense.

Presto. A few tweaks, and it sounds significantly cleaner and more professional.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've used it for letters of appeal for authorization as well as medical necessity for DME. I see its usefulness if it totally integrates with EMR. Our EMR is a lot of click and fill in boxes so I don't find it as useful for that

> **Response 2:** I use Hipposcribe. Definitely a game changer !

HELP! 

I am trying to get credentialed with United Healthcare although I’ve heard nightmares about this insurance company. I have a couple of patients that want me to see them, but have UHC. 

Are any of you mobile therapists credentialed with United Healthcare in Maryland? I was told they do not cover outpatient therapy in the home.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No! Lol. I get $45/visit. We only accept it as a goodwill to our patients, referral sources and of course some of their family members have Medicare. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** UHC is one of the top 3 reasons I started my own cash practice. 

I talked one of my previous patients into continuing on a cash basis since she has a high deductible anyway. Something to think about.

I know this topic has been covered before BUT I had someone approach me about seeing their mother for PT. Her mother is on medicare. She and her mother would prefer to see me over an in-network provider but I told her I am not comfortable seeing medicare patients because of legality questions. Now I'm questioning the grey area of can we, as cash-based PTs, see medicare patients for PT? I have avoided medicare patients entirely thus far but would like more information. Can anyone give me a more solid answer on the rules for treatment of medicare patients as an out-of-network provider? Does anyone have a good healthcare lawyer in Massachusetts that they can refer me to so that I can answer more of these types of questions myself?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t see why this is even an issue. You aren’t defrauding anyone, the patient is making their own choice to see you and  use their own money. What is best for the patient trumps anything else in my opinion.

> **Response 2:** This rule applies if it is a covered service by Medicare. Medicare only covers “medically necessary services”. If you can justify that you’re seeing her for something that is not exactly medically necessary you should be fine. 

I would also argue that no one really cares. Medicare isn’t going to come for you and say “you should have taken our money, not the patients.” But that’s just a risk you would have to be comfortable taking if you do think it’s a covered skilled service and can’t argue otherwise.

Hello all.

Im doing homecare PT for Medicare part B patients in NY and I make 62.5$/hour plus all the benefits. 

Ive noticed that the company i work for gets reimbursed about 200-220$/(empire) visit which makes me want to open my own company and work on marketing myself if this is the reimbursement rate. Why shouldn’t i do this? 

Having to see less patients and having more time for myself would be great. Please let me know What are your input from those who have done the same:

Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There is no way they make that for 4 unit treatments for Medicare. They may bill that. Steven Glukh is in NY he can give his thoughts.

> **Response 2:** Pretty certain you are looking at what was billed. Example, I operate my private practice and I bill $60 per 15 minute unit for Part B mobile outpatient. That comes out to $240 billed for 4 units/1hour. After payment we are looking at $100-$108 actually received. Add in the cost of EMR, liability insurance, marketing, billing, book keeping, etc that $100 becomes a lot less real quick. Add in a 3.4% decrease in CPT codes reimbursement for 2024 and I average a $5 decrease for 2024 reimbursement per hour. Depending on what I bill for. As an owner you are taking 100% risk and when you come home from seeing patients you are wearing all of the hats. You are also risking that something was billed incorrectly and you are not getting paid. Consider that above and if you are willing to proceed go for it! Owning your own biz is the way to go! I love what I do! 

If you are talking Home health part A. That's a bit more complex, as you have to adjust for community/institution, complexity, and patient diagnosis. Two 30 day periods and how it's reimbursed differently for every patient admitted.

Is it kosher to be contracted with Medicare part B, but choose to not contract with all the Medicare HMO Advantage plans and just charge cash for those patients?  I'm ok with straight up Medicare, but all the Advantage plans are giving me reflux. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It was my understanding that if the Medicare beneficiary has OON benefits in the Advantage plan we are obligated to accept that as a Medicare provider?

> **Response 2:** Medicare advantage plans are best looked at as commercial plan. Plain and simple. They really have 0 ties to Medicare.

Do one thing differently!!! 
For my mobile patients…. Anyone that’s a senior, disabled or a veteran I run their property tax exemptions if they own their home. This person missed two exemptions for the past five years. Their property taxes are lowered now by $700 a year and they got this refund. ￼ checking this takes me about five minutes a person and I couldn’t pay for advertising with this kind of effect. #ThinkOutsideTheBox 🎁

Welcome to stupidity in healthcare. 147 claims (I have yet to be paid THIS YEAR) from the state telling me I forgot GP on each claim.  Well that’s healthcare dollars well spent. 441 pieces of paper, ink, 147 envelopes and postage.  All could have been resolved with one phone call.

**Community Responses:**

For the folks in mobile med b and cash only mobile practice, do you plan on adding some insurances to fill your case load…do any other insurance reimburse for mobile services other than med B or have a higher reimbursement rate and are worth getting credentialled for a solo mobile physical therapy practice…sorry for a dumb question.. I will be practicing in northwest Indiana

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The headaches of dealing with insurance companies was one of the main reasons I started my own practice.
Medicare is so easy to work with.  The private insurance companies require lots of extra paperwork, all while breathing down your neck… not to mention the difficulty of getting accurate information when you call and speak with a rep.
As a solo provider, it’s not worth the extra time/effort (in my opinion).

> **Response 2:** To help me make this decision, I did research in my area in regards to the payer mix. For an example 98% of the population have insurance, Medicare and BCBS of GA at that. I had to also consider my niche population (Lymphedema and Geriatrics) which requires frequent episodes of therapy care which can add up if cash pay. Another factor was the economic status of patients.  Taking into consideration the people I will serve and my area, insurance contracting was a no brainer. However there is opportunity for me to partake in the 2% cash pay population in the form of offering Wellness Services

Physical therapists treating Medicare beneficiaries for cash using the  “we have no relationship with Medicare” thought process is like saying, “I don’t pay taxes because I have no relationship with the IRS”.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think I get what you’re saying here… I just want to post my two cents about Medicare

Understandably we’ve paid into the benefit through taxes, and it should be used to buffer the cost of healthcare at the age when all those expenses are hitting. 

But if individuals have the means to not use the benefit, it should be less complicated to allow them the ability to control how they spend their money. 

Advantage plans can con people right out of traditional Medicare, and into the palms of private insurance corps. But providers aren’t given a clear cut way to educate clients on resources or strategic healthcare spending…

The insurance gambit is a fixed game against providers and patients.

Medicare/Cash Based Question!  

**I tried searching through previous questions and haven't quite figured out my answer.**

I have a side cash-based only mobile PT clinic (my main business is animal PT).  I'm mainly only doing this side human PT gig so I can keep using my dry needling skills and help people with acute or chronic muscle spasms, hence the cash-based only.  So many people ask me for my services and I want to get paid for my time and needles vs giving treatment away for free (which happens a lot with family/friends).

I had a patient with Medicare contact me and she wants me to bill Medicare.  Since my business model is cash-based only, I do not need to see her, correct?  I know as PTs we can't opt out of Medicare, but if my business model does not incorporate Medicare or any other insurance, I can safely decline to see her provided I offer her other companies that accept Medicare?

Thank you in advance!

Pic for attention!

**Community Responses:**

Is it illegal to treat Medicare patients on an out of pocket bash based basis for physical therapy?

Background: have started a mobile cash based practice and initially had the target of under 65. I’ve had a physician want to send his folks to me- but most of his people are Medicare. I was under the impression that physical therapists cannot opt out of using Medicare for covered services- and if not lisenced by Medicare then you can’t see them. 

Is this true? If so, is there any specific site or paper I can find this written at?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are not in network with Medicare you cannot treat a Medicare beneficiary with skilled physical therapy services when the services are medically necessary.

> **Response 2:** Simple answer is no. If u want to treat Medicare beneficiaries for PT services that are covered by the Medicare program, u must enroll in Medicare.

Alright everyone, I’m just looking for some advice/ place to rant. I’m ready to start seeing patients. I need to get my NPI and my consents ready but I don’t think that’ll take long, I can do consents this weekend. I’m getting discouraged because the local marketing I’ve done and will continue to do will be geared towards seniors, the clientele I like to work with. But I’m not even close to enrolling with Medicare. I know it’ll take a while to get that done. How do I deal with the calls coming in if they’re Medicare patients? “Oh yeah sorry I can’t see you because you have Medicare, OR we can only do wellness” like, this sucks! I don’t want to sound uneducated in the subject or like I can’t see these people. Probably like 85% of people I’ll be seeing in the future have traditional Medicare. It’s just so discouraging when you’re trying to get started. Any advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Getting enrolled in Medicare does not take long at all! ￼ if it’s something you want to do which I highly recommend if you’re seeing older adults, you could literally do it today ￼ and get approved in a couple weeks. Also, when you enroll, you can technically start seeing clients because it’ll go back to the date you enrolled as long as there are no issues. ￼ I’ll send you some info on the Medicare enrollment.

> **Response 2:** Once you complete the application, you can treat immediately. You would just have to hold your billing until you get approval.

(For reference I had a Subaru Outback before, at best 28mpg and cost to fill up was around $50 and I def had to do it every week; with RAV4 Hybrid, it’s like 38mpg, cost to fill up is about $30 and I typically do it every other week if not occasionally every three weeks)

This is just a reality check. If you are a clinician and not directly paid by Medicare and you are being paid by another entity (employer)…this is why the owner should make more money than the employee. Clearing house hack February 2024 and not being paid by Medicare October 2025. I know owners that have already taken out six figures of a loan/credit line to make ends meet this month.  This is part of this business. This is not part of any other business.  Restaurants don’t wait months to be paid by their customers. Hair Salons don’t wait months to be paid by their clients. Don’t put all your eggs in one sour basket.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** IMO this will push the UPTA civil rights lawsuit violation in the fast track. Why does the government think that we will work for free? And then tell us we can’t charge cash? Make that make sense

> **Response 2:** There is a new organization United Physical Therapy Association and they are suing the government to get PTs to be able to take cash from Medicare pts. Hope they are successful!  This is a nightmare

For those that use Luna to see patients that want to use their Insurance, what is your script when discussing pricing? Initially I imagine you discuss you are OON and your Cash price. If they decide they want to use insurance, then what are you saying to them to put them through the Luna system? Are you verifying their benefits to know if they might be better OON, than paying towards deductible with Luna? Wondering what has been successful for others using this method.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just give their name and email and phone via the app to luna. Luna Does it all. No money talk. 
If they insist on using insurance, I state I have a company we can use. It may take 1-2 weeks for authorization and scheduling. We will be subject to insurance guidelines on # of visits and procedures.

Anyone running a cash based clinic for geriatric clients (Medicare beneficiaries), how do you notify your clients with Medicare that you can’t provide PT? Do you charge less for wellness sessions or keep the flat rate? Can this even work? I go back and forth in my head thinking it can and then that it can’t…in need of some help here. I love working with seniors, really anyone over 50, and really want to make this work. Want to be able to provide PT to non Medicare beneficiaries but know most will be 😖

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Heather Reichenau nope! I know it sounds funny but that's what I meant. I truly believe that the results for which many older adults are looking, require a focus on wellness sessions which help to establish a lifestyle change. Those results are not possible in your typical therapy POC...which is why so many just continuously go through the cycle of immobility after discharge from skilled care, never reaching their goals. Educating medical providers, families, and most importantly patients about these legal cash pay services is the future. One by one we can change the lives of so many. 

To add to this, which may sound even crazier, the quality of care with the insurance based model has gone so far down, that patients don't even want it. But anything medically necessary has to go by the rules.

> **Response 2:** It is very tricky because if you treat a Medicare beneficiary and falls under the realm of skilled PT you cannot accept cash.

I work a lot with the geriatric population as well I was really hesitant about having to deal with insurance. But I did go ahead and enroll with Medicare and  they paid very quickly on my first client.
Their rules are actually quite simple and as long as you follow all of the documentation and CMS requirements you should be fine.
When you add Medicare and the secondary it was about $105 a visit.
You can always add non covered services to the mix that are not covered by Medicare but you'll have to be very upfront with your patients so they understand what constitutes a covered and non-covered service under Medicare

I have a cash based pelvic floor PT clinic and I also take Medicare. A patient called me and said she had Medicare, so I scheduled her and then had her email me her Medicare card. This is what she sent me. Is this a Medicare advantage plan? Would she have to be a cash pay patient since this isn’t Medicare? Thank you. New to this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, that is an advantage plan and you would have to be in-network with Aetna. It may have out of network benefits, but I doubt it.

> **Response 2:** Yes, this is a Medicare Advantage plan, as others above have stated. Because it is a PPO, she has out of network benefits and you can bill her insurance without your practice being in-network or having a contract with Aetna. These PPOs often have a large deductible or out of pocket max that the patient has to meet prior to insurance “kicking in” for services. You are allowed to have these patients private pay since it’s not a traditional Medicare plan (sometimes they’re more willing to go this route if you can provide them with a superbill so they can submit it to insurance themselves). Hope that helps!

Medicare has me scratching my head… I am starting a cash based mobile PT business very soon. Many of the patients around Cape Cod have Medicare and have reached out to me for services. I am fearful and confused on pursuing the Medicare populations for compliance purposes. So far everyone I have spoken too are mixed about it. I just did a random chatGPT search and this came up. 

Anyone treat Medicare beneficiaries and have some insight and can provide insight onto how to approach Medicare for payments, etc?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Gwen Simons is a PT/attorney and a great resource that many cash based therapists. I signed up for her program and she's helped me navigate all of this stuff. Highly recommend!

> **Response 2:** Are you individually enrolled with Medicare? If you’ve treated patients recently through an employer that accepts Medicare, chances are you could still be enrolled, so this would be relevant and you wouldn’t want to accept cash pay from Medicare beneficiaries. You can check the status of your Medicare enrollment though the PECOS portal

Here is a visual of why someone would pay you cash.. no insurance. This is a “not small business” (>1000 employees) a family of 3…. Would have to spend $45,000/ year before insurance kicks in. Why even take the plan out??? Just get major medical and pay the rest yourself. What a joke

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What makes it worse is that there are instances where you could find better coverage on your own but you aren’t allowed to purchase because your employer offers you a plan… they literally tie your hands. Only way to finally get the lowest premiums I have ever paid for family coverage was to go self employed.

> **Response 2:** About to man this boat. Insurance is a joke and the more who abandon it, the more change will occur. Personally and professionally! 🤷‍♀️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use my home address for my office address too. I was cleaning out my garage about a year ago and had a ton of old computer stuff to get rid of and also chemicals. So I loaded it up and headed to the dump. The guy nicely informed me that the minute I chose to claim my home office now my home was a business and I would normally have to pay per pound ... He was kind and let me dump for free ONCE. Saved my $500!

Tax Prep!
Is it ok to do your own taxes?  Is Turbo Tax good enough for a small LLC?  Tell me the pros and cons.  I know it’s last minute.  I was about to upload all my info to a CPA but then I figured I might as well do it myself.  I am the only employee with basically a side hustle income.  Thanks for your input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just a quick back story. I'm from a farm and have helped my parents with tax prep for many years but they always went to a CPA to put it all together. I thought I knew everything.

This year, I decided to do it on my own. Last year was the first year of my PT business. I also had a W-2 and another small business. I just received the biggest return of my life... I mean huge. All because I used TurboTax, learned the system, and studied the rules on the IRS website. 

Teach a man to fish as they say. Some CPAs are amazing. However, most of them just collect your info and submit. They don't have time to go through all the potential write offs and holes. My GF was about to submit hers last week. I calculated it and she initially owed $750. After I was done, she received a $1600 refund. I learned all of that info from doing mine this year.

> **Response 2:** We just paid $900 to have ours done. We have 2 very small LLCs (just us). I think I might return to Turbo Tax!

Letter from Medicare stating we bill more  therex than our counterparts ....  I'm not sure what to think ...  what else are you to bill besides therex as a PT OT.... I could see if it was all Neuro or an Therapeutic activities that is billed higher .... 
...the letter stated for us to look into our billing practices in the next 6 months 

Thoughts on this ....

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The best way to avoid audits is to diversify your billing.  Any exercise can be billed under any type of code, it all depends on why you’re doing an exercise.

Straight leg raise = ther act if you’re prescribing it to help the pt get their leg in bed 

SLR = neuro if regaining quad and hip flexor cocontraction. 

SLR = ther ex if doing it purely for strengthening. (Generally though, aren’t you strengthening something so the patient can DO things?) 

I bill ther ex the least because I’m usually prescribing an exercise to have the patient regain a specific task.  It also bills the least.

> **Response 2:** A lot of therex is them telling you that you aren't focusing enough on function, which is all that medicare wants to pay for

For PTs billing out of network how much have you seen in reimbursement for 4 units of physical therapy?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** All you have to do is submit a claim and see. Your patient won't be meeting their OON deductible anytime soon so you will have plenty of data on what the plan pays. All of them pay differently OON even within the same carrier. Some plans pay dollar for dollar and some pay a % above Medicare. If you are billing OON you need to be collecting your cash pay rate and by the time you might get reimbursed you will know what the plan pays.

> **Response 2:** Completely depends on the plan/carrier. Sometimes $80, sometimes $500 like stated above. 

We balance bill and always collect up to our cash rate if insurance low balls us. We disclose this ahead of time and it’s very legal to do so. Their EOBs even say it to the patient that the provider is OON and may charge higher than what the EOB says.

**Original Post:**
I started a small private Pilates rehab practice out of my home. Im private pay but when asked, will provide a superbill to a patient/client if they want to submit it to their insurance company. I started to see a number of older patients (over 65) for Pilates but also incorporated some balance work, falls prevention and PWRmoves (Im certified in that for Parkinson’s). Im still cash-based but after reading some of the posts online, Im wondering if I can still be a cashed-based business if they are on Medicare. As a PT, If Im providing prevention/wellness services can I bypass Medicare altogether? Im not even a Medicare provider, but thinking I ought to be (not sure of what that entails but thats a separate question ). I would appreciate some guidance on this. Im certain the topic has been covered however there are definitely gray areas so wanted to get some clarification and direction. I’ve just been charging an hourly rate or do bundled packages.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I really appreciate the insight. I feel like I can make a clearer distinction for wellness when Im seeing my healthy general geriatric pop. I feel like I run into a problem when I see patients who actually have a diagnosis, for example, my Parkinson’s clientele. Can I stilll provide PWR/dual task, therapeutic exercises (some Pilates based/some not) all out of pocket? I have a handful of people now who want to come specifically for all of these things. Can I still deem it wellness? They all understand Im private pay and are happy to see me regardless. Going forward however, like you suggested, I should be clearer on my intake form and billing. Im currently giving a bill for services the way I would a PT patient. I give them a bill on my letterhead, diagnosis code and treatment codes. I think Ive just done it that way out of habit, not realizing that my 65+ clientele really should have just a wellness bill without codes etc. because I dont want them trying to submit it to Medicare.

> **Response 2:** For anyone wondering about how to handle Medicare... I highly suggest taking Anthony Maritato Zero to Paid course. Worth the money. I have a much better idea of what is considered a Medicare covered service and can say that I have successfully incorporated Medicare into my mostly cash based practice.

Insurance question: We are a cash based outpatient clinic. Just recently one of my clients asked me to generate a Superbill as she is going to submit a Medicare claim. I just found out that the Medicare claim can’t be submitted by the pt and has to be submitted by the healthcare professionals. I have never done this before and I am also skeptical if it’s going to affect my business in any sense? Also I don’t know if Medicare has a certain policy on how much we can charge out of network from a Medicare pt.

Please help me figure this out! Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** May want to set up a meeting with Rick Gawenda or Nancy Beckley

> **Response 2:** I thought we are unable to treat Medicare patients for cash based if it is a medically necessary condition/treatment?  I have been turning them away until I gained my provider number

Hello fellow PTs. My wife and I started our cash based mobile PT business. We consulted a law firm about working with Medicare patients. They told us that we would be able to work with patients as long as they are aware that we would not be charging their insurance. The law firm recommended we have the patient sign a Medicare Cash PT Release form. Does anyone have any experience with this? Would anyone be able to provide a template for this form?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are going to be providing skilled and medically necessary services to Medicare Clients I highly recommend you get credentialed. Review the Medicare Guidelines and Mandatory Claims submission rules/regulations as it pertains to PT/OT/SLP.

> **Response 2:** Despite the fact that you are an American, despite the fact that you are in the United States of America, you do not have the freedom to control your business.  👀 ￼ does that sound weird? Because it is.  ￼ we need to level up.

**Original Post:**
So we do our due diligence by calling and verifying benefits for every single insurance patient we have. We write everything down and keep a name a reference number as well. For every insurance patient we always ask “do you require prior authorization” and for specific CPT codes. BCBS anthem is denying payment saying we did not verify prior auth but I have all documentation that we did. They “investigated” the call and gave me 3 different stories about how we didn’t have the correct reference number, the call got disconnected, and the last story was that the call “cut out” during the time when we were apparently asking about auth. I’ve asked to hear the same recording and they won’t allow me and say that it’s not possible. I am planning to “escalate” the situation but is there anything else I can do? This is just getting out of hand and it’s sickening what insurance companies continue to get away with.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This has been a growing problem for years, and the insurance companies have no accountability. We really need to start sharing these stories with our patients. I think it would also be a great local tv story. No other industry would work the way we have to regarding insurance and reimbursement. Seriously, who do you know who worked today, not knowing when or how much money they’ll get paid. Insurance is controlling the healthcare narrative- hoping you do the “wrong thing” from “provided” information so you don’t get reimbursed. This is probably why so many of us are part of this group- to change the narrative one patient, one uncaged clinic at a time, all while giving our clients the phenomenal care they deserve. Ok, that’s it. I’m tired now

> **Response 2:** Report to state insurance commissioner.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You did the right thing, said the right thing, and you owe no more effort to the conversation. He’s asking you to claim doctor patient confidentiality while also claiming there is a medical issue serious enough to cancel a flight but not serious enough to not take the same trip at the same time with a different airline. Hard pass. Narcissists will always turn your boundaries into their victimhood.

Does anyone use Jane as their EMR system?

I am starting the process of looking at EMR systems to use. My patient population is mostly Medicare age clients. Currently will be out of network with all other providers, but may start credentialing with insurance companies if it will be worth it. I am ￼also hoping to have cash based PT, private wellness, group fitness classes, and maybe virtual sessions in the future. 

Right now it’s only me, but I’d love to expand to add other therapists (PT, OT, SLP) in the future.

It seems like Jane will fit all of my boxes for now and future growth, but I am wondering if there are any other systems out there that might also fit my practice. ￼￼￼￼

*Side note: Looked at hellonote, but not sure if it would fit for my group fitness needs in the future.￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree it works well for private pay but there is absolutely no automatic way to track compliance for Medicare like when a PN is due or UPOC. I can manage being solo but I can't imagine having to track it if I had staff. There'd be no way to run a report to see what's due. The billing side seems ok to me but I just started using it with Offic Ally and a biller.

> **Response 2:** I use it cash and superbill route and cannot imagine navigating it through Medicare. They’re working on adding form tracking for things like LEFS outcomes but it’s not there. It’s beautiful for how it use it sans insurance

**Original Post:**
Where does medicare draw the line of 'medically necessary' (I know I'm not the first one to ask this....just frustrated again)?  Say we have someone who can perform their daily functions with no restrictions (but maybe some mild discomfort/pain), however their main complaint is that  they are limited & painful in their ability to go hiking and play pickleball.  Would a wellness plan, with a treatment focus around making hiking & pickleball easier for them to participate in,  even if it entailed some manual therapy skills, be allowed under a cash-pay arrangement?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t confuse services covered under the Medicare benefit with medical necessity. 

Medical necessity is just one part of the requirements for covered services. 

Reasonable is another part. 

Standard of care is another part. 

This is a balancing act for sure. As Nancy mentioned, you are the therapist and make your determination based on the initial evaluation and findings. 

After that you develop your treatment plan and based on published guidelines you make a determination of what YOU believe falls within the coverage guidelines. 

You may charge cash for non-covered services and seek reimbursement for covered services. 

But reimbursement is always conditional. 

Ultimately you are not the one paying the bill nor is your patient. So Medicare would make the final determination if it ever came to that under review. 

And when Medicare makes that determination the Medicare rep will look at published guidelines and your documentation. 

I would say by far most of what I see in small, private practice outpatient therapy is largely non-covered services. But therapists are so desperate to help their patients they are willing to assume the financial liability associated with over utilization of services. Or they just don’t understand the intent of Medicare coverage.

> **Response 2:** Sounds a lot more like a cash pay service. Unfortunately Medicare isn’t concerned about someone’s ability to play pickle ball… regardless of how important it is to the client

Hi everyone! I have started my mobile practice – cash pay and Medicare- but I am absolutely hating dealing with Medicare. Reimbursements are all over the place and I’m tired of being stressed trying to figure out why and getting signatures for POC’s has been a nightmare. Has anyone ever gone in with Medicare and then opted out in less than a year? This is a side hustle for me and with two other traditional positions right now I would rather just focus on the cash based side. Thanks for your help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are a PT, you cannot opt of Medicare. You can choose not to take it, but that means you cannot charge cash for skilled therapy services (that Medicare would cover) to Medicare beneficiaries. Reimbursement is not great across the board with any insurance, including Medicare. The rates are dropping again in January. I honestly find Medicare probably the easiest insurance to deal with compared to other insurance headaches I deal with.

> **Response 2:** ￼ It might not be Medicare that’s the issue. It could be the combination of the EMR and billing company. What state are you located? What billing company are you using? How many clients are you seeing?

How would you proceed to discharge a patient who is causing havock, is pushy/aggressive and keeps pushing your boundaries, BUT is also a health care provider (though other discipline) and not only you share a few patients with but has sent you patients in the past (so kind of a referral source, which is why I’ve been very diplomatic). Plus this guy is super charming and his patients love him. So I am nervous about him bad mouthing me. Ugh
I have 7 additional sessions authorized per his insurance. It pains me the idea to see this person 7 additional times. And the chance he will want to complete more afterwards and get approved for it. For what is worth it he is improving. And he is happy with me as his therapist. It is just that the emotional havock he causes is not worth the discounted rate his insurance pays me. 

Please advise!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Generally if he is like this with you he is like this with everyone. 

Of course he likes working with you because you are willing to let him be this way and it feels good to him. 

If it ends badly it will likely happen in the way you expect. He will through a tantrum and make you feel guilty but it doesn’t matter. You can only be a punching bag for so long. 

His influence on others also doesn’t matter. They likely know how he is and won’t put much importance on his opinion. 

Personally, I would finish the approved visits. Increase the intensity of the workouts to a level high enough that it is uncomfortable for him to continue. Celebrate his success and if he choose for more just find a “better” therapist who can take him to the next level of success. 😂

> **Response 2:** I know this personality all too well. You absolutely cannot give in to his demands. It’s like adding fuel to a fire. He knows he can take advantage of your demeanor. Once you cut off his supply of validation/winning, he will find a new target. It doesn’t mean you have to discharge him immediately. Do the 7 visits and have a firm end date. He will likely periodically bother you in the future but don’t give in! Also if he bad mouths you, ignore it. These types of people are smear campaign experts. He will flip flop between badmouthing and praising you.

For those who are solo practicioners do you find it’s worth it financially to work on your own from a tax standpoint? I’ve heard the amount of tax you pay is significantly higher than if you’re an employee.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You pay a self employment tax that covers Medicare (2.9%) and SS (12.4%).

Yes, owning my time is worth much more to me. We homeschool, I have a mobile PT practice, I participate in pro bono events, I run a mentoring/coaching service, and I'm able to run my business ebdeavors the way I desire. All-around win for me and it hasn't been a financial hit tax wise either.

> **Response 2:** Being taxed as an Scorp helps significantly! Make sure you work with an accountant that is an Enrolled Agent (EA)— they are experts in the tax department for small businesses. My accountant has saved me tons of money by knowing the ins and outs of all the nuisances of being self employed

I have a patient with Medicare (I'm a participating provider) and UHC AARP supplemental plan, I called to verify benefits... Medicare deductible not met and AARP doesn't cover the deductible, they pay 20% once deductible is met. What do I charge the patient until the deductible is met... The full allowed amount of the visit? 20% of the allowed amount?
When submitting claims, do I then put on the CMS1500 form how much the patient paid? When will Medicare know when the deductible is met?

Thanks for any input, this is my first time seeing a patient where the deductible isn't met!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Colleen Tickner Crawford did you figure out what to do? I’m in the same boat right now? If you were collecting the payment up front, what did you do to show that you did that so that can apply towards their deductible? You still bill Medicare?

> **Response 2:** Option 1: treat but know that what you Re supposed to be reimbursed will go towards the deductible and not you. That is about 2 visits. 

Option 2: have the patient pay the $226 to you and then treat.

Option 3: if they are not willing to pay deductible let them know that therapy services will begin once deductible is met.

**Original Post:**
I need help! I was seeing a patient with Luna (outpatient at home) and patient was in the process of having Luna become an official provider with her Mass Mutual long term care insurance. She was not using Medicare whatsoever. She was self pay with Luna and Mass Mutual after 90 days would begin to reimburse her. Long story short, the patient and her husband became so irritated with the process (Luna and MM) that they have decided to hire me (cash based) to see her. 

If they do clear me as a provider, I am wanting to make sure 1. Mass Mutual understands that I am mobile outpatient and not home health. 2. If she was paying Luna self pay at $125, is it totally off to pay me cash?

After 90 days of care (she started with home health then moved on to outpatient) they will reimburse her services once they get the invoice. I left the clinic to not have to deal with insurance. I’m venting and asking for opinions on this, whether I should take her or not. She would pay me and I would provide an invoice just like Luna would have done for her. 

Hope this makes sense! Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Besides the Medicare issue, I had a similar patient who wanted me to work with her when I wasn’t established. I gave her receipts. But then she wanted to submit all the receipts to her long-term care and get reimbursed. The long-term care insurance wanted full codes, and Proof of billing that Medicare rejected it before paying for it. I would just make sure that she’s not using your bills to get paid back because then it opens up a can of worms. ￼

> **Response 2:** Tricky situation. Typically the purpose of a LTC plan is to cover costs for the insured if they lose the ability or need significant help with at least 2 of 6 functional tasks: bathing, eating, dressing, toileting, bed transfers, and chair transfers. If her home health discharge OASIS paperwork showed that she was independent with these, Mass Mutual may have a case not to pay them. You would essentially have to show that she is restricted with at least 2 of these.

Since she still has Medicare, there still may be a case from a CMS federal level that she can’t pay you cash if you/the patient are trying to  make a case that her treatment is medically necessary (because she has functional limitations that need treatment) 

I personally wouldn’t take them as cash pay and would have them continue to go through Luna and/or use Medicare part B insurance. If she needs services like dry needling or other skills that are helpful and not covered by Medicare, I would invoice them for that and they can submit those services to Mass Mutual. They may still be eligible for some reimbursement and you wouldn’t be caught in a battle between CMS and their private LTC policy

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Of course I’m very biased because we’ve had a Mobile hybrid practice since 2018. Re-recommend taking Medicare and doing cash for everything else. Except of course if you have an insurance that pays extremely well. We have a couple of those. ￼

> **Response 2:** Take medicare if u bill 1 ta 1 te 1 nr and 1 mt its 108 dollars per visit where i live in florida outpatient and if u live in nyc boston la etc major cities it pays more.  Eval with 2 tx codes is 140 dollars and most people have medicare with a secondary which means they pay 0 dollars and you get over a hundred.  All u need to do is get their doctor to sign ur plan of care which is easy theres no authorizations etc its easy

FYI. Zoom in. This is RTM …. Immediate feedback on HEP. I messaged her right away to hold 3.  She is young. I’m not getting RTM reimbursement but it’s my HEP program too. And yes there are pictures to the left (cut off) and there are videos for the patient to play.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have you actually submitted to Medicare and gotten reimbursed? From what I have heard from other providers using MedBridge, the cost of trying to get clients to answer the needed questions after each session, to correctly login each time, to set up and the cost (at least on MedBridge) was not worth it. Larger places have a PTA contacting them and basically urging them to keep logging so they can bill out. Also, at least in MedBridge, it doesn’t even track the time spent for you, so you still have to do that. Some sort of timer when you’re in X client’s chart seems helpful for this thing. It feels like one more way to track stuff that isn’t actually helping. (We have a EHR with great messaging so we hear when we need to about HEP and if it’s an issue. We can also track it in MedBridge but I prefer to have all I can in our EHR.)

> **Response 2:** Very cool! Yeh, please come back and let us know the cost. Thanks for sharing

I realize when you become uncaged, you become so excited you want to join every everything. And the sound of “In network” is rejuvenating as if you are joining your local country club. That’s the problem. The verbiage is incorrect. Change up your vocabulary to what it really is. If you start using the following in lieu of in network, it might be more beneficial to you your business and your employees. ￼ start saying: 
“Insurance-friendly fleecing rates"

“In-network bargain basement reimbursements"

“Discounted care circus rates"

“Budget-friendly insurance swindle rates"

“In-network reimbursement discount extravaganza"

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** More patients, less money, and more paperwork are the ingredients for burnout soup.

> **Response 2:** It's a process.  We dropped some of our lower payers and got more money from same payers as an out of network provider.  It all depends on the insurance plan.

Taking part of my reply to someone else’s great question post. 
***
Why do people agree to pay cash to CAM specialists (Massage Therapists, Acupuncturists, Chiros, Personal Trainers) and Nutritionists and psychiatrists in Psychotherapists, yet fully expect insurance-based PT?

I think that the answer is somewhere in the following: 

PT as profession had a long journey to become recognized as a medical/healthcare field. Attaining medical recognition was a win and a loss. 

Today, two dfferent models of operation exist: 

Chiro + Personal Training + Massage = Wellness ~> Luxury: cash

PT = medical = necessity: insurance

Do we as PTs want to be associated with one or the other?

The answer is neither and both.
We need to carve a new model. And carving something new is… hard.

Maybe the answer is to change the Wellness to Wellbeing in branding? Or Wellbeing and Whole Health?

Like .. “Wellbeing in Function and Whole in Health PT?”

Dunno.

I am in the very beginning of thinking about my own practice, associated with an unexpected but a welcome move. 

I will be planning and carving, drafting and re-writing things. 

One thing that I will be doing from the very start is to brand my practice as the place where clients start to feel better about themselves and about the things they do for the living, for recreation, for fun and - for functional mobility. 

Because the whip of insurance-based PT is the mere functional gain. Our society insurance-based model is to pay for the person not to die, the rest is secondary.

I want people to be more than functional.  Beyond functional. 

Like… hurt by personal training -> seek Beyond Functional PT to return to sport.
… not responding to acupuncture 
-> seek Beyond Functional PT to relieve pain.

Not long time ago Massage Therapists started being recognized as professionals and not a subsidy of sex work industry.  Just 15 years ago I was asked by a client in a well-respected upscale spa if we do happy ending (I came to PT from being a LMT first). 

Somehow Massage Therapists are not recognized by Insurance as providers of medically necessary therapy (even though regular therapeutic massage greatly relives stress on par with Psychotherapy covered by insurance). 

We as a whole profession need a break from medical necessity equating negligent pay.  

And just maybe APTA need to step up too. But it’s a subject for the next rant.

Thanks for your attention.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I appreciate your rant. I do think there are a lot of people that (probably wrongly) associated cash pay with luxury and I think there is also that challenge of meeting undeserved patients that may not be able to access cash based care without insurance. 

Where I live there is a bit of a challenge convincing the masses that good health and wellness is an investment and figuring out where that lives in their priorities.

> **Response 2:** Excellent post and viewpoint. I am 100% in agreement with your point regarding whole health branding for improved functioning. I would love to continue this conversation among all of us therapists on this platform.

How do you educate patients about the difference between Medicare and Medicare replacement plans?  I take medicare, and patients keep saying they have medicare, and I get them all signed up, and then find out it's replacement, add they don't understand why they would have to pay.  😬

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They should have read the book they're given each year to explain how their health services are billed. 😑  If in person, ask to see their cards first. If not, have them email a copy. You need that to verify coverage anyway. Tell them up front you don't take Medicare Advantage plans. If they are not paying anything extra each month than their $174.90 that is usually subtracted from their Social Security payments, they probably have an Advantage plan. Although some Advantage plans have extra premiums as well. Sounds like their Insurance agent didn't educate them well. It's the job of the agent to make sure they understand their coverage. I would direct them back to their agent if you don't want to spend the time. 

Traditional Medicare is quite costly. I remember my mom paying up to $454 a month over her base premium (now $174.90). And she wasn't really ill until her last year alive. Only hospitalized for 2 TIAs and having 3 children. You are going to see more and more taking Advantage plans. They have a max out of pocket limit that lowers the financial risk. If you are not an ill person, Advantage plans make sense. Plus you get dental and vision benefits, and other perks. Otherwise you are paying close to $600 a month for Insurance you may or may not use

> **Response 2:** I ask for their cards before, check benefits. If they have Advantage I explain they chose to give up their Medicare benefits to an insurance company who now “manages” their health care like any other insurance company. I then refer them to another PT clinic that may take their insurance. The Advantage plans are absolutely awful and predatory and should be illegal the way they prey on our elders.

Today my patient had a genius idea!!! Insurance companies give their patients a set amount (say 10) PT sessions each year. They can be for a problem or preventative like ergonomics!!! In the end they would pay less for meds and surgery!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** One of the main reasons our healthcare system is as broke as it is is because of how frequently people change insurance providers. Because of this, insurance companies see preventative healthcare as lining the pockets of their competitors. 

To market this, you would want to pursue a large corporation (the pull with insurance companies) that has an abnormally low degree of employee turnover (benefit from keeping employees healthy).

> **Response 2:** There is a company named Centene. They actually bought a medium size company that specialized in doctor visits at home and used it to prevent hospitalizations and save money. A managed system like that would be the company to pitch it to.

I have a patient with Aetna in our physical therapy clinic. He has insurance but a high deductible. So we charged him our self pay rate of $180. And when we billed his insurance they deducted $160 from his deductible. Patient called us and said that we owe him $160. 

How do we tell him that we did not get paid $160, that’s just the amount that his insurance plan took off his deductible. And we charge every single patient $180 if they have not reached their deductible.

Do I have to reimburse him the difference of $20?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting no one knows the answer or able to provide easy clear source 🙄 

All for a hard, laborious, mediocre pay job that's greatly needed. 

I call waste, fraud and abuse on the bureaucracy of the professsion. Doctorate required but yet no one can tell you how to bill for services 🙄

> **Response 2:** Lots of incorrect info here. 

Sounds like his plan only had 160 of an allowed amount. Doesn’t mean you’re limited to the allowed amount. 

Remember there’s technically no sure thing as in network and out of network. 

There’s contracted and non-contracted. There’s a difference.

I find it saddening how vigorously some  will defend the limitations of our ability to serve people. I’m talking about the issues with serving people who may be Medicare recipients with coaching or wellness, teasing out the nuances of skilled or unskilled care. I don’t understand why some are so vigilant at chastising therapists who attempt to serve people based on their incredible training and skill set. Therapists who are trying to serve people that are begging for help. Therapists that are trying to stay passionate about a career they love and a system that has broken so many of us, and leaves many patients floundering for support that is reliable and professional. I know that many of the comments are designed to protect people and their license. However,￼ I don’t understand why we are not outraged that this, limitation even exists.  I don’t understand why professionals like us defend it instead of saying this is utterly ludicrous, and we must change it. ￼ I have personally struggled to find care for a family member that needed specific rehab services and none were available for weeks and weeks. This was in a reasonably large metro area and I’m sure I’m not alone.  How is it even reasonable that we should not pay cash for someone that could support us in a timely fashion? ￼ We can do better. We can make a change. We can serve more people that need us. 
￼ I’m not arguing the rules that are written. I’m arguing how absolutely ridiculous they are and that we should be more outraged that they exist than trying to defend them. ￼ Rant over. Please recognize this came from struggling to find help for a loved one.  Seeing it from the patient side is heartbreaking. ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The whole Medicare thing is ridiculous. You should be able to see whoever you want with your own money.

> **Response 2:** I’m pretty sure the limitation exists to protect Medicare beneficiaries from being bewildered and scammed.  

Having said that, I don’t agree with the limitations, but I think what you sense as some people vehemently defending the rule isn’t that at all.  It’s exasperation at the number of professionals in our field who have such an incredibly poor grasp of the current law before they jump into business.  

People jump on here every day asking questions about how they can treat Medicare patients for cash and then people respond every day citing the mandatory claims submissions regulation and skilled vs unskilled and it is exhausting to see the sheer number of people who don’t understand it - whether you agree or not. 

And I think that is mostly proof that most of us are caregivers relying on fb groups to teach us instead of doing the work of properly setting up our businesses. 

So I don’t think you are sensing that anyone is defending the rule.  We are however defending the need to know the rules if you are going to be in business.

**Community Responses:**

Hey team, 

I’m excitied to say I’ll officially be Uncaged by September 15th! That being said, I need to find a “reasonable” health insurance or health share option. I have an HSA so I’m fine with high deductible plans. It would be for myself, my wife, and our 7mo old daughter. 

I appreciate any advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just went thru this process.  I can tell you the marketplace has high deductible hmo plans surprisingly affordable in my case. I had a insurance broker help me navigate marketplace.  Also texas farm bureau has a high deductible plan fairly comparable. Not sure if that is option where you live.   Other than that I'd try a health share company like medi share.  For me these three options the only ones that made remotely any sense.

they have OP contracts so they’re covered

Hey everyone! I have a lymphedema practice and am 100% cash-based.  I have a patient wanting to start with me but she is Medicare/Humana and I am not in with Medicare. I told her that she will need to go to a clinic that bills Medicare, but she is desperate because she has to pay $150 for medical transport. There are really not any mobile CLTs in my area but me. I just want to make sure there is no way around Medicare. I feel bad not helping her, but I don't want to mess with Medicare. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Contract with a home health company who is INN and treat her. She'll either have to pay $150 for transport to a clinic where they take insurance or pay you out of pocket so maybe it's a wash?

> **Response 2:** I think you technically could have her sign an ABN saying she refuses to have her information sent to Medicare and you would have to comply.  I think if you don't do this often it would work, but not 100%, maybe something you can look into further.

Hey everyone,  I’m back looking for some help to clear stuff up again.  

I’ve finally got a consistent referral source and am getting Medicare referrals.  However I’m running into a lot of issues when I call to check benefits of:

A. Not even being able to get through to someone on the provider line because I’m not “in network” with them to ask about the patients benefits 
Or 
B. Getting told the patient doesn’t have out of network benefits and I can’t see them

From my own experience I know that sometimes you get told things by representatives that aren’t correct.  But I’m running into a lot of confusion on my end because of all of these individual plans inside of the Medicare replacements.  Like I’ve had referrals from patients this week and all of them had different UHC Medicare plans (one dual; one AARP and one UHC Medicare group or something like that) 

I’m resigned to the fact that this is a learn as I go along process, but I’m just wondering if there’s a way to navigate and understand this better or if anyone has any tips because I’m worried that im going to end up providing services I can’t get paid for or ending up turning down patients I can see.  

So, anyone out there have a cheat sheet? lol

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wonder if it would make a difference if enough Medicare recipients spoke out about having their access to care restricted. Does anyone know the rationale behind allowing medical providers to opt out vs. allied health?

If you’re seeing older adults 65 and above and you’re providing skilled and medically necessary services, OT and PT cannot ￼opt out of Medicare. ￼ If you’re providing wellness or preventative type services, you can do cash.

Question:
Literally ALL of my elderly patients thought they had Medicare as their primary insurance and then also a secondary. Come to find out, they all have medicare advantage/ "medicare replacement" cards that are actually their primary insurance.
My question is, if someone's primary insurance is medicare advantage (through United Healthcare, Security Health Plan, Anthem), can they pay cash since I can't even bill Medicare for PT services?
Anyone have experience with these Medicare Advantage Plans?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting question.especially since their Medicare is being managed by these advantage plans.

> **Response 2:** I'm in with Medicare and OON with all commercial insurances. I end up taking a lot of advantage plans OON, as the insurance has to pay Medicare rates. It just depends on the individual plan whether I will take them or not.

Did you think the Hertel and Brown case was a fluke or a "one off"? Guess again!

Owner of Oahu Physical Therapy Clinic Sentenced to 9 Months in Federal Prison for Health Care Fraud.

Timothy Wells admitted that from July 2013 through early 2020, he submitted false claims for payment for physical therapy services to TRICARE and Medicare. Wells used individuals not trained in physical therapy, including massage therapists, athletic trainers, personal trainers, and an individual who had no professional licenses or certifications whatsoever, to provide physical therapy services to patients. Wells admitted that he knew these individuals were not authorized providers and that he could not legitimately bill TRICARE and Medicare for physical therapy services rendered by them, even under supervision. Nevertheless, Wells billed the programs as though the services had been provided by licensed practitioners.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just don’t understand all the hard work and effort it takes to become a therapist and people choose greed over integrity it’s just crazy 💀

> **Response 2:** If you commit blatant fraud, you deserve to get caught. Hopefully, that does not fall under their professional liability claims, or we all end up paying for the bad guys. To be fair, from what I read about Hertel and Brown, there was some pretty shady things going down on a personal level with the owners as well. When you use unlicensed people to perform physical therapy--we all know this is fraud. If you are looking to make $$$ in the profession, do us a favor and leave rather than mar the profession.

Is becoming “in network” with Medicare a game changer? A PT was telling me that he still makes over $115+ on each 60 min session and that he stays booked d/t the population wanting to use those benefits. 

If so, what’s the easiest way to make this possible? Any resources? TIA!

I have a self-pay patient who I had been seeing for PT. she initially told me she has united health, I told her I didn’t take it so she was willing to pay cash and she was planning to submit the superbills. She later told me that she had BCBS (I am in network with them) but she had already submitted the superbills. Then they were kicked back to her for more documentation but the letters were coming from CMS. We found out that she actually has MCR (with whom I am a participating provider) and BCBS secondary. Furthermore, she put the wrong year birth date, making her age 10 years younger than her actual age, so I wouldn’t have even known that she was Medicare eligible. Anyway, she’s now trying to get reimbursed by Medicare for the cash pay visits we’ve had. I’m unsure what to do because I took cash pay from a Medicare beneficiary who I didn’t know was a Medicare beneficiary. Any advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is she who she says she is?  Bill MC and refund cash payments.

> **Response 2:** Not a big deal. Just bill Medicare and refund after you are paid.

Hey everyone taking the first steps to go uncaged!!! I found a nice space with decent rent in an independent gym. My game plan is to be in network with medicare and out of network with all others. 

In terms of medicare. I know that I will need yo apply for an LLC then take the EIN and tax ID and apply for a type 2 npi number and submit all that to medicare for approval. Does anybody know how long that approval process takes? 

In addition, for the out of network part…is there anything special I need to do for that part?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did all my own credentialing but Medicare was...a process. It took me forever. I dunno why I had such a hard time with it. It's just filling out the paperwork, really. BCBS was a much quicker process

> **Response 2:** I’m in the same boat, just a little further ahead. Medicare I heard anything from a week or two turn around to 30-60 days. OON from my research is nothing you really need to do. Just if a patient wants to submit a super bill to get some cost back they need to have out of network benefits and tend to be paid back in 1-2 weeks.

For those of you that are OON/cash and take Medicare part B. Are you still charging your normal rate, having them sign an ABN and then submitting the claim on their behalf, but still collecting your full rate at time of service? I'm just wondering if it is worth starting to take Medicare, but their reimbursement is typically garbage, so I'm just wondering what people out there are doing. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Legally you can't do that. You agree to accept what Medicare pays a full payment for Medicare covered services.

> **Response 2:** If your schedule is full, and you can get it full with cash pay patients, of course that’s going to be more financially feasible. For me, Medicare patients pay well enough to make it worth being in network with them. You cannot have them sign an ABN as a blanket Coverage at the beginning of every treatment. You only have them sign an ABN when they are doing a treatment that you don’t expect to be covered like after the KX modifier. (I believe)
I like having a mixture of Medicare and cash pay.

If you want to know what is wrong with healthcare in this country, look no further than this. Insurance companies and 3rd party administrators like ASH and Multiplan getting incentivized to deny claims or cut payments to obtain a percentage of the "savings" from the employer self funding the plan. Meanwhile the healthcare provider loses out on reimbursement or the patient is stuck holding the bag having to make up the difference. All while the insurance company and 3rd party laugh all the way to the bank. Complete sham of a process.

> **Response 1:** We recently dropped Cigna/ASH at the clinic I work at because we had a contracted rate of $65/visit and out of nowhere they decided to only start paying us $32/visit. After arguing with them for over 6 mos my boss just said, “fine. We’re no longer taking your pts.” Then they decided to come up to $50 but since that’s still shy of what we’re supposed to get, my boss laughed and still said no. A lot of disappointed pts, but they all seem to understand for the most part

> **Response 2:** I saw a lawyer today on social media who was informing clients and the public of tactics that certain insurance companies have of just flat out refusing to pay as long as possible, to the benefit of the insurance companies’ bottom line. 

I’m about to make a post about this, and start sharing this sort of thing. I think providers should. What do you think?

So I’m finally going to quit my outpatient Ortho job to pursue my cash business full time. I’ve had my business since 2019 so I’m ready. I’ve only kept my ortho job because of family insurance but after finally having needing to use my insurance for my sons emergency surgery we have painfully learned that it’s really not worth keeping. ￼So as I go to full independence I’ll need another insurance for emergencies. Can anyone give me their favorite health share company?? We live in MN if that matters

So made a few calls for a billing company and I'm truly feeling overwhelmed.
- company 1:  charged for everything-  credentialing, contracting with insurances, benefit checks and billing. Everyone of those above categories had a fee of at least $200 or  percentage of 6.5%  to 7% depending on what they would be doing for me and how much I made monthly.
I know this is standard but I legit felt ky hair falling off with how much I'd be paying them to work for me.

- company 2 sounds to good to be true. They charge based on how much I make monthly. This includes benefit checks and billing. Adding to this if I make under a certain amount every month they collect nothing. So in other words, they'd work for free?
They are also willing  to do some upfront with as well such as finding out what insurances maybe best suited to take if any at no cost.

Credentialing and contracting would be a different price based on how many insurances I'd like to take.

But I just can't understand why they'd work so hard for me if I make less than a particular amount which going in, I know I will based on how many patient visits I'd like to start with. Is this truly to good?

While I'd like to ideally have billing done in house down the road, at this moment I'm just feeling like I understand nothing of how to run a business. 
What are some things you took into consideration when hiring a billing company? Are there billing companies you can recommend as well. I'd like to compare a few more.

I know I can't be the only one that feels lost 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you just now starting your business as a solo provider?

If so, I highly recommend learning how to bill yourself initially until you have a caseload to justify someone else doing it. Also, once you understand it yourself, then you will know if the billing company is actually doing what you need them to do. 

If you have an EMR that does integrated billing it’s actually fairly simple once it’s set up. I do my own billing for me and my 2 PTs with no problem using HENO.

> **Response 2:** I agree with this. Also depending on your insurances accepted/patient volume it is very simple to verify benefits as well. It takes me about 1 minute to verify BCBS benefits.

You guys always have good answers for this type of question…￼

I will be done with my current company in December with my medical insurance lasting me until the end of the year. All along, I have been looking to put my family on Medishare as we have used this before in the past with a great experience/no issues. The plan I have been looking at for me and my family would cost us roughly $300 a month for a very high deductible (annual household portion as Medishare calls it).￼ We have no issue with the extremely high deductible, as we have very little to no medical expenses throughout the year. ￼

There is also another option available to us in Texas that would put us on a more typical health insurance plan for only $90 more a month. My initial plan was to just go with the cheaper option (Medishare) for the reasons stated above. ￼

My question is regarding tax deductions for paying insurance premiums. I know that Medishare would not be tax deductible as it is not traditional insurance. The other option would be tax deductible since it is health insurance. Would the $90 a month difference make it worth the tax deduction at the end of the year? ￼

I plan to ask this question to my accountant but she is unavailable over the holiday week next week. I need to start applications for these options soon so trying to get advice from anyone who knows from experience. Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I will follow this because we do the 400 dollar a month family plan with 8000 AHP with Medi-Share! I would say it probably won’t make too much of a difference as a write off, but I’ve never done it so I wonder how much it gets you. We have loved Medi-Share and I don’t think we’ll switch. Do you mind sharing what the other plan you’re looking at? Since I’m in Texas too!!

> **Response 2:** I have had medishare … 3000 ded. Never a prob.

Why is anyone giving a penny of their money to this company? Any employer any employee. If these are your benefits at work, that’s all you have to know about your employer. Take their money and buy insurance elsewhere. We all know they pay the worst for a physical therapy visit so I have the insurance and why being network? Someone has to stop the insanity because that’s exactly what it is.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My husband is part of insurance negotiations for his work (a medium size non-profit). UHC is literally the only insurance company that would quote them. BCBS and Cigna both declined to even quote them, so they’re stuck with UHC and as a non-profit they can only afford so much. He is fighting to change it next year based on what he’s learned from me as a OON provider, but it’s been an uphill battle. I wish we would stop villainizing the employers.

New PP owner and billing newbie!…I called UHC to see if a client has OON benefits as I’m only credentialed with Medicare, I was told I could see the client and did not need authorization. Co pay would be $70

Client agreed to copay and I treated for 4 sessions. I just got the EOB in the mail and the member responsibility for Eval was $25 (not $70) and then member responsibility for 2/3 treatment visits was $0 (haven’t received the last tx eob)

Since the client no longer needs therapy I’m obviously going to reimburse. I have one more EOB im waiting to get back - I’m wondering if I should wait in case that shows $25? 

Also Is the EOB final or is it possible UHC will come back requesting the initial $70 they had said or $25 for the tx visits they charged $0??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is why you let the patient deal with submission for out of network benefits, in my opinion. You end up calling out of the good of your heart, spending your time, and then given the wrong information. Then, you get next to nothing back. It’s unfair to you as the provider.

I am seeking clarification on requirements for mobile physical therapy providers. We have been experiencing a surge in requests from patients seeking home therapy for family members who cannot visit our clinic, with 2-3 requests per day. What specific requirements must we meet to provide home-based services under Medicare and commercial insurance, beyond designating the place of service? Are there particular rules we must follow? Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We do this. Change the place of service. From Office 11 to Home 12. Congratulations!!!

> **Response 2:** Consider a general liability policy in case you damage anything at a clients home

I started my solo practice on the side in April, just cash-based, and finally made the leap to leave my full time gig.  I opted to start taking BCBS, as a number of my patients wanted to follow me and didn’t feel they could afford the self-pay rates. I felt good about keeping it simple with just one insurer, and decided to use MedLife to do my credentialing (they were great!) and billing.  The billing portion has proven difficult here at the beginning, to say the least. 
Main question: they are saying I need to sign up for claimMd as well. Isn’t that redundant?  
Also, where did you all learn about the whole process??  I knew I was spoiled not needing to do more than CPT and billing codes throughout my career, but I am resourceful and it’s seeming ridiculous I can’t get a clear explanation anywhere about the process. TIA!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You need a clearinghouse to send your claims to, who then sends them onto the insurers essentially. We use claimMD with Jane and do billing in house (also INN with BCBS). It’s not hard to do yourself once you get the hang of it. Jane has GREAT modules and is super helpful if you need to call and talk to someone.

> **Response 2:** “I didn’t feel they could afford the self pay rates”… is a limiting belief and an assumption. 

Every consumer is buying more and more goods these days from Amazon, Walmart, Costco, BJs etc etc. Most people are spenders and buy whatever they deem valuable.

**Community Responses:**

I saw a patient who has Medicare just over a year ago for general strengthening. I have no relationship with Medicare and told them that Medicare won’t reimburse. Well I just got a call from her son asking if I can help him submit to Medicare. What do I say to gracefully get out of this? 
I am also worried about Medicare even getting wind of it because it was likely medically necessary, she just refused to see her primary doctor to get set up with home health and she and her family were insistent on getting some strengthening.

Edit/update: I realized that this son wasn’t there for the initial conversation I had with the patient and their family. I sent a message explaining the situation. He took it very well and was understanding. Thanks everyone!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Confused on the HH piece? She would not need home health? She could just see an output therapist in home under med B ?

> **Response 2:** Did they sign anything acknowledging that they understand you don’t have a relationship with Medicare and that your services would not be reimbursable? ￼

UPDATE: 

Just found out the payer has been sending payment to another PT group because the practitioner’s NPI is associated with that group as well (she works there prn). Has anyone encountered this?  I am at a loss for how to fix this.  

———————

One of our cash-pay clients has been submitting self-claims for reimbursement.  His insurance is BCBS Federal.  He has yet to receive any reimbursement.  Today he was told by his insurance company that "because the NPI is on the superbill, payment was sent to the PT practice..." (it wasn't); and, "the PT practice will need to reimburse you for these funds and there's nothing else we can do for you."  Basically, they have told him (falsely) that we, the PT group, have been receiving reimbursement for his already-paid-for cash services.  Except we haven't received a dime!  It's so ridiculous that I don't know who to call in order to straighten it out.  Plus, I don't have time to be on the phone arguing this as a solo practitioner / owner.  Has anyone else dealt with this?  Honestly, every self-claim attempt my patients have made, regardless of payer, has led to some level of headache and frustration for both the patient, and for me.  It's maddening.  Any advice appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m fighting to get enrolled because my npi is associated with other clinics for the same reason and it’s a nightmare. Idk what to do!

> **Response 2:** Yes it’s maddening. I’ve been chasing payments from tufts for six months for three of my therapists

I am starting the process of re-investigating medical insurance for myself. I am an LLC with one employee about to be 2… I am changing my status to employee. For the past four years I have paid a reasonable premium for a UHC policy through multiple companies. I find it confusing. The issue is that it’s geared for having no problems and last year I spent probably 10k on out of pocket things that weren’t covered (not covered things that really weren’t illness) I’m realizing that it would be better to spend more on the front end since it would be a business deduction and the out of pocket expenses are not. What are some of you doing for medical?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Christian Healthcare Ministry is a healthshare and it's what we use but you will still pay for most health costs. I also recommend an HSA card for lower tax burden. You can Google which cards are best.

> **Response 2:** I’ve been in business for 12 years and insurance for small business sucks across-the-board. However, one of the few good things that the APTA has done is offer large group coverage for small business of eight or 10 employees or less. I think it’s on the website, I signed up for it and I’m only paying about $60 more a month for my plan starting in August but now I have no deductible, I have no coinsurance. I had a $10,000 deductible before and had to pay for everything out-of-pocket every year. ￼

Just became a licensed health and life insurance agent in my state. It’s now very clear why insurance companies act the way they do. They MUST pay a claim in a very short time frame …. However… there is no legislation on taking the money BACK!!!!!!! They know they don’t want to be turned in to the state insurance director…. So they pay… legislation needs to be written on the other side of that fence. #MyNextProject

**Original Post:**
I have a question about OON billing...I apologize for the length of the post but I am incredibly frustrated and I would greatly appreciate any advice!

I've been billing OON with EmblemHealth and UnitedHealthcare for 2 different patients. EmblemHealth began denying all claims after patient met their OON deductible (how convenient...). I've called several times, long story short it's been a mess, they say it was all an error on their end(denied stating I already billed for those services that day which just is not correct and they acknowledge that), and they keep just resubmitting them for review, they get the same error, and repeat. It is significantly delaying payment to me.

For UnitedHealthcare, I had to get prior authorization with Optum physical health through this "Voluntary Prior Approval" process. I took the time to do that (a lot of time since they approve 1-4 visits at a time) and I was told I wouldn't have to submit medical records. I submitted claims for all of the appointments that were approved with the approval number. They only approved 2 claims (sent both checks to the patient even though they told me if they assign benefits to me and I accept assignment it would go to me, both are not cashed and the patient says she never received them.). UHC denied one of the claims stating they asked for medical records and I didnt respond so it is denied. The other 5 were sent to Optum Insight for review and they are still processing until they recieve medical records from me. I never recieved any letters asking for documentation. I call and they say oh it looks like a completely different provider info is on the claims and sent to X address (which isnt mine), someone really messed something up here. However, on the patient's portal my name and NPI are associated with all of the claims...They essentially said they can't do anything about it, I have to wait until they are denied within 30 days of not receiving records (some are past that timeframe already!), then resubmit the claims and hope they dont screw it up again...this is completely unacceptable.

Is this something to bring up to the State department? UHC owes me $9100 and Emblem hasn't paid anything since May...Safe to say I am only giving superbills from now on...it doesn't matter how large their fee schedule is if they will not pay you and require as much admin work as in network!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** yep.  send it all to your state insurance commissioner.  this has got to end.  noone should have to spend thatch time and waste just to get paid an amount they already approved.

> **Response 2:** Wow that is awful it is my biggest fear of seeing patients in general and dealing with insurance. I'd like to hear input on this as well!

Hello guys! What are your tax strategies to lower your taxes for mobile therapist and having an LLC? Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Best thing is keeping track of mileage!

> **Response 2:** Hey! A few things that help, track all your work expenses (mileage, gear, CEUs, software, etc.), look into the home office deduction if you do admin at home, and consider a Solo 401(k) or SEP IRA to lower taxable income. If you're making good money, switching your LLC to an S-Corp can also save on taxes. Def worth talking to a tax pro who gets the mobile therapy world!

As a hybrid physical therapist in Texas, I am currently contracted with Medicare and BCBSTX, which provide decent compensation. My remaining visits are cash-based. I am interested in learning if other members here accept additional insurance plans that offer competitive reimbursement rates (approximately $100) and have fewer administrative hurdles. I aim to continue growing my practice while ensuring its financial sustainability.

**Community Responses:**

What are the cons of becoming in network with insurance? It seems like insurance reimbursement rates are quite high compared to cash rates per hour. 

Is it simply not worth it to become in network because of the authorizations, paper work, delayed payment, etc? Please help me understand why more clinicians are not working privately but also in-network as opposed to only cash based?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cons of working with insurance - you have to work with insurance. 
Have you never had to call an insurance company and beg for another 10 visits for your stroke patient but they only give you 4 because insurance doesn't know the difference between an ankle sprain and a CVA ?

Which EMR system do you recommend?

Hoping to find one that takes care of the billing but also open to others as I want to keep it cost effective.
Planning to start up as a mobile PT business that treats patients with Medicare as well as cash patients. 
If you don’t mind saying if your EMR system includes/excludes the billing for you (and goes to bat for you if insurance denies your claim) that would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Next Thursday, the 25th, I’ll be hosting another Community Q&A with JaneApp. Come learn about their product!

> **Response 2:** I used hellonote for about 3 years when I started. It’s a great platform but I felt like I needed more help with billing and revenue/KPI reporting as my company grew. I recently switched to StrataPT - Physical Therapy EMR & Revenue Cycle Management. They don’t charge you for the EMR or per user but they take a percentage of the billing. They do all the billing, follow up on denials and everything. I have a lot of contractors which made companies like prompt way too expensive for me…. With strata, I can add as many contractors as I want, and there is still no actual cost for the EMR, only the percentage for the billing.

Hi everyone, I had a patient send me a denial from her insurance from the superbill I sent her. Just for reference, I am out of network with all insurance companies! 
I took a snap shot of why they said it was denied. Would someone mind sending me what their superbill shows? Maybe I’m missing something? Or maybe it’s saying I’m out of network? Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

I am making a big push to increase business to completely “uncage” and want to add that option. Anyone in LA with experience in cash clinic have some advice?

Hello!
I am strongly considering going to a cash-based only practice except maybe keeping Medicare. I am in Virginia and I am currently in-network with just about all Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurances. Has anyone made this change? What are the drawbacks? How long did this take for you? Anything to be wary of? THANKS!!!

**Community Responses:**

Jan 2023 I will be uncaged PT Hallelujah!   
Question: pt calls & ask do you take insurance?
I know my first response doesn’t need to be “No but I……” 
So give me your 1st couple of sentence response to this question that makes them not hear NO
Thanks in advance just trying to work on my marketing skills

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m real blunt, I just say “nope, I don’t contract with any insurance companies, I just exchange services for a flat fee payment,” and let it sit. I feel like right out of the gate that demonstrates the simplicity and transparency of the business model, which is one of the biggest upsides. It also can remind them that that is how most other business operate, and reinforces that that is entirely reasonable. Then I gauge it from there based on their response.  Sometimes I bring up super bills and HSA/FSA, sometimes I basically say “I am out of network for multiple reasons” which opens a door for them to ask why, and I can explain the benefits of the business model a bit. Sometimes I say “out of network care can be more or less cost effective depending on your coverage and issue” and I’ll follow with asking if they have stellar or poor coverage/copays if they’re post op or non op etc. which gives them a chance to tell me what’s going on and build rapport. I truly don’t try and sell every call, I openly tell folks when i think in network is the move if I feel they’ll benefit from frequent shorter visits and have great coverage, and when low cost is a massive priority for them.

Generally when I drop that first line and leave it, they’ll have some questions that will demonstrate sticking points if they have any. Ultimately most are just asking that because they think that’s how you’re supposed to shop for healthcare, not because they’re sold on going in network. Usually they’re calling because they want to tell someone their problem, so I try and get us to that point without shoehorning the convo in any particular direction. 

But, I also am not one that likes to haggle or do a lot of convincing. I don’t want a patient on my books that I have to fight to get scheduled because they don’t want to prioritize paying for care or can’t pay for care. If they truly can only afford me once every three weeks, have a ten dollar copay with deductibles met, they honestly may be better served in network anyhow, so I take the L, offer to help them find someone else, and don’t sweat it. 

That’s my approach. May not be the best from a brute sales perspective, but it fits my personality well and is authentic to me, so it works!

> **Response 2:** “It’s great to talk to you! I’m not in network with any insurance companies, but I’m happy to provide a super bill, which is basically just an invoice for each visit that you can submit to your insurance for potential partial reimbursement.”

Do you worry about medically necessary when seeing a cash patient?
Say I am out of network with patient’s insurance. I have a doctors order, and I am providing a skilled service. 
Patient is a young man who has a diagnosis that makes him have muscle cramps and pain.  Mom refuses to place him in pain meds. They tried massage, stretches, etc. he has a hep, stretch program and is very compliant. But it is not enough. Md suggested pain medication, muscle relaxers, but mother is set on avoiding drugs. They like that after my treatments he is pain free for up to 1 week (used to be 2 weeks until he relapsed 3-4 mo ago). I give superbill and insurance has been paying them faithfully but it makes me anxious that we’ve been doing this for almost a year. 
If tomorrow insurance decides all this therapy was not medically necessary because maybe pain meds were cheaper or whatever… am I liable? Even though I did not submit anything to insurance ? (Tricare)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My son is similar. What we have to do, unfortunately, is stop about once a year for a few months to show regression. As a mom, I wouldn't allow pain meds either. You just need more in my opinion. Sounds like your patient is showing regression when you aren't treating. That, along with needed skill, I wouldn't worry about it. My son won't make progress (most likely) but we are preventing "scissoring" from muscle contractures/scoliosis.

> **Response 2:** Tricare is fabulous insurance. As a recipient and also having a ton of Tricare patients I’ve never experienced a denial or needed to submit a note. If you are helping him with his pain and living a better life- it’s skilled.

Okay help me brainstorm…. What keeps a PT clinic from billing for skilled PT, and also charging for a gym membership and fitness training to address fitness goals that aren’t skilled?  It seems like as long as the patient is 100% informed about what is PT and what’s covered by their insurance, and what services are NOT PT and what the costs are, that we should be allowed to do this?  I’m just thinking about all the non-covered, “nice” perks that we provide under the banner of providing “high quality care”, which could more appropriately be charged for cash on an ala-cart menu of options.  

I imagine the cleanest legal way to do this would be separate business/LLC’s, separate spaces, separate billing systems, and of course some crystal-clear communication to the patient.  Anyone doing things like this?  

My reason for asking is actually that I am a professor teaching global fitness exercise to students, and they probably shouldn’t prescribe push ups and overhead press for plantar fasciitis patients, but I want to encourage them to maximize their value and skills even beyond the rehab goal. 

Of course this model also makes a strong case for cash-based services that simply provide for ALL goals regardless of insurance coverage…. But I’ve never done it!  Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I own a semi private training facility and PT clinic all under one roof, one LLC, one set of books. There is no issue. It’s a whole different service and insurance is not being billed for it.  They sign a membership contract for those services. This is also almost no different than someone being cut off by insurance and becoming a self pay patient,  minus the fact that you aren’t doing skilled evaluations or follow ups that would require documentation.

Hey y'all I saw a post earlier about a group of clinicians who got in trouble for fraud. I had a question regarding this. I've been working for a mobile home health agency for a couple months and we see all kinds of insurances. We have PT, PTA, OT, OTA on staff. For the PT and PTA my boss cosigns all of our notes and I believe he is the only one credentialed with insurance. He hasn't spoken to me getting credentialed. I work as a contract worker so it never crossed my mind that I may need to get credentialed later down the road. Is it illegal for him to cosign my notes for this long? He also wants us to see our pt's for 68 minutes so he can bill for 5 units. ( I'm in TX by the way )

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It sounds like you're doing mobile outpatient not home health? 
It sounds like they want you to do 68 minutes to use the rule of eights to get to that five units.  If the patient truly needs the care, That's okay although I feel like done repeatedly it might raise a red flag. I contact with a company locally who is also a mobile outpatient provider and they encourage us to work with the patients for up to six units who have traditional Medicare.  I find that it's not warranted in most cases and most patients can't tolerate that length of treatment anyway. 

But every so often I get someone who's really involved and I can totally justify six units. 

If you're a PT I'm assuming you're doing supervisory visits for the PTA?

> **Response 2:** I own a clinic with 4 other PTs and an OT, and had to get them all reassigned/credentialed under the business. So they bill with their NPI but it is under the business. 
I don’t cosign their notes.

Hey everybody.  This is gonna be a long one.

I’m trying to stay positive here but I’m just really frustrated.  I run a Medicare/hybrid mobile clinic and I am just having the hardest freaking time with all of the Medicare replacement plans outside of UHC and Humana.  Every Aetna, Anthem and Molina referral I get I just dread trying to figure anything out for them.

I finally got on availity, but it’s hit or miss if I can even use it to look up the patients.  Half the time I get error messages for the information I put in, saying numbers are correct when I know they are.  The other half of the time I submit for preauths and they can’t cancelled for no reason that I can find.  And don’t even get me started on trying to call into the companies.  The information I got for all three of these agencies was that I have to get “in network” in order to bill them, but the directions they all gave me to get in network were wrong.  

Anthem said I have to said a fax in to this designated fax number, the fax came back saying that it was undeliverable. 

Molina said I have to fill out the Medicaid form, but I don’t have a Medicaid number, nor most of the things that form was asking me for. 

And Aetna said I have to apply and then had a mile long list of things I had to do in order to apply.

And the kicker is I don’t even know if I truly have to be in network in order to bill these insurances, but when availity has been unrealizable in helping me look this stuff up. 

I know some of you will tell me that I need to stop taking insurance, and I would love to build up my cash paying clientele, but while I’m breaking into that market, this is what I’m getting referrals for. 

I guess I’m just looking for some guidance.  Does anyone have a tip for navigating this stuff better?  A person to call for guidance, a place to go for info?  Any info would be appreciated

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BCBS Anthem is horrible 
You have to send W9 for each and every claims for OON 
They are not enrolling any therapist for in network for state of GA!
Give them super bill and you get your cash!

> **Response 2:** There's podcasts called uncaged clinician.. they're free but you can also hire them for consulting for mobile services. Good luck

**Community Responses:**

My only Con so far is that the first payment did take extra time to process and I think I had to contact customer care, but they responded prompty and, after that, it has been reasonable turn around time for my standards.  Looking back at recent payments, it is taking 2 days to be deposited into my bank account once i bill the card. My code is shay098

So here’s what’s going on now with my OT practice. The lady who I paid to do  my credentials did NOT keep them up. My NC Medicaid has been terminated due to not providing a copy of my business license..RIDICULOUS since that’s all she had to do and what I paid for. 

I applied for re-enrollment Monday, they emailed saying I do not meeting federal guidelines. I have no idea what this means but I need my Medicaid in place ASAP. This has been a long annoying process. I feel like I spent all my money to get everything set up appropriately and nothing got accomplished except for emptying my pocket. 

I guess I will call them today. Anyone have any ideas, advice on this, or some encouraging words?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We used a credentialing company early on and had an aweful experience it is better to do it urself and just learn the process im not familiar with nc medicaid process but if u apply u can call and ask what else needs to be done

Hey Everyone. 
I am looking to get credentialed and contracted with some Medicare Advantage plans. Has anyone gone through this process yourself, and was it a difficult process? Or did you use a credentialing service?

If you did use a credentialing service, which would you recommend? I've gotten text messages and emails from people soliciting their credentialing services, but I'm not about to respond to any of those, I'd rather reach out to a company I know is reputable. 

Thanks for the help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Courtesy bill out of network!!! Check their benefits and see if there are any stipulations to seeing them if you are out of network. I currently do this for plans with OON benefits, and they usually pay me Medicare rates.

> **Response 2:** I bill all Advantage plans OON. In my experience over a couple years the patient is responsible for either the same or slightly more than they would be with INN provider (maybe a $10
Difference in copay). No one has turned me down for it.

Hi all! Question about paying yourself:
I have an S-corp in CA, it is cash based PT only and my side business on top of my full time HH job. 
I have finally hit $10k profit this year and would like to pay myself. Apart from paying California taxes such as the annual franchise tax, what is the best way to organize paying yourself? Do I use a payroll service as an employee with a W2? Also, how do I calculate income tax on the amount paid to myself?

I tried to use the search for this but couldn't come up with any useful results. Any input would be appreciated as I'm new to this! Thank you :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe you have to pay yourself a "reasonable" salary for your work. That's what my accountant told me. I'd highly suggest asking an accountant and using one consistently that can help you with this. I've been surprised more than once with the rules I didn't realize existed. I'm in Ohio, so rules may differ, but the differences between LLC and s Corp consist of payroll, including payroll services, paying both sides of taxes, different tax forms, 401k matching etc.

I see patients privately at their home and haven’t run into this yet. I have a former patient wanting to see me after her TKR. From my understanding I cannot accept cash from her, she is under Medicare and the services I’ll provide are medically necessary and covered. Is this correct?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can bill Part A for home health as long as she meets homebound criteria and then switch to Part B when she is no longer homebound

> **Response 2:** That is correct, cash cannot be accepted for medically necessary and covered services which it would be. If they're discharged from PT and have goals beyond what is medically necessary then you could though. There is a bill up for PTs to be able to opt out of Medicare and then you would be able to but currently as it stands we are not able to opt out

I am forced to use a new billing system and I keep getting this error and I am having a hard time deciphering what this means. This is for the CMS1500 form.

**Community Responses:**

Those who take Medicare part B: have you had BCBS federal employee plan used with Med B. Is this a supplemental plan? I’ve been trying to call but could not reach a human. My patient lives in Kentucky so he has Kentucky Medicare and BCBS FEP but is also a snow bird and stays with his granddaughter here in FL part time. He is in FL at the moment after brain surgery and I’m seeing him for PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, typically it’s a supplemental plan

> **Response 2:** Careful with FEP secondaries (not supplements). It depends which plan they have. I think my patient had preferred and they wouldn’t pay, because I was out of network. So it was patient responsibility.

1 manual 
1 ther act

Is it crazy to specialize in geriatrics if I want to do cash-based mobile services? 

(City with a population of 110,000). Background: I love working in Parkinson’s and have a lot of experience/training there. But those folks will nearly always qualify for maintenance, therefore, Medicare billing, right?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I disagree with "nearly always qualify for maintenance." My practice is young, so take this with a grain of salt. I have had some luck graduating patients from formal PT into a cash/wellness program once they no longer meet restorative PT or maintenance PT eligibility.

Maintenance is also typically a very low frequency. Once weekly or less. I haven't had luck with this yet but hope to build up a roster of hybrid peeps where MCR pays for once weekly maintenance visit but then they pay cash for extra visits to up their frequency to 2-3x/week.

It sounds like the challenge would be lead finding. If you accept Medicare you could generate your own leads, but then you have to bite the Medicare bullet. Just my 2 cents.

> **Response 2:** Be very clear on what is therapy and what isn’t. That should help clarify everything.
A lot with PD have Medicare and will want to use that most likely. Just all how you market your services

Hi all, I am totally cash-based, but previously worked at clinics that billed insurance. I got a call from BCBS because they still had me as a PPO provider. They thought I needed to reimburse the patient and bill through BCBS. When I explained what I do, she told me I needed to “de-par” with BCBS and gave me a number to call. 

Is this true? Anyone else done this? I’ve not heard of it before. I opened a year and a half ago

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yeah... I had this happen to me. They had actually sent the payment for my patient to the other clinic. My patient told them she was pissed because this is a hipaa violation because now that clinic has her medical info. They were clearly concerned because she got her reimbursement check 3 days later (vs typical 45 days). Anyways, they sent me some form to fill out, and it's never happened since. 

Someone mentioned being linked to EIN, but despite having clearly different EINs, they said in the system it's still linked via NPI. Interestingly it happened out of the blue with 2 patients in a row but never an issue for the years prior.

> **Response 2:** Yes. Sometimes with bcbs if you are contracted through an old job you need to call and have that cancelled.

I just spoke to BCBSFL after getting 20 claim denials for secondary patient from the same patient.  They said they don't pay out of network benefits with this plan.  I was under the belief that if Medicare pays, then the secondary has to pay.  Does anyone have information on this?  I am not really set up to have time to call everyone's secondaries before they come in to see if they are in our out of network.  Thanks for any help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Supplement is different than secondary

Some secondaries (PPO) will pay the remaining 20%. Other secondaries (HMO) will not. 

True secondaries are generally few and far between but you need to know what you’re looking for on the card. Those are the ones where you call or look up benefits so you get ahead of things like this.

> **Response 2:** If the secondary doesn't pay, patient gets a bill and a super bill and they can follow up.  Not my insurance, not my problem. Says right on my website I am out of network for everything but Medicare and I make no guarantees when asked.  They are welcome to call before scheduling but I'm out of network to avoid all that BS so not calling anyone or filling out anything.

*Please delete if post not allowed 

Sorry for the long post. I have a personal question but figured people here would be most knowledgeable. Can we bill for indirect care? I was under the impression we cannot as it’s not direct contact. I‘m in California.

Background:
Im taking my kid to a multidisciplinary peds center (offering PT, OT, SLP) and they gave me the following information. They’re charging me for notes? We’re also only getting one therapy service and won’t have a team. 

Edit: They are in-network with my PPO and accept other insurance. No Medicaid, I don’t know about Medicare 

“Examples of indirect care include meetings where members of the child’s treatment team discussed the child’s progress in their treatment plan, as well as the creation of progress reports. If the child’s treatment program is funded by a program that allows us to bill for indirect care, then the client is not responsible for the cost-share associated with indirect care. However, if they do not cover indirect care ** Therapy will bill you directly.
The explanation of benefits (EOB) that you receive from your insurance provider may shows that they had paid for dates of service where the client did not have any direct interaction with the treatment team. If a client’s insurance benefit is canceled and the client does not inform ** Therapy of the benefit cancellation, then the client or legal guardian will be responsible for payment of the direct and indirect care that is not covered by the insurance provider. Therefore, it is very important that you inform ** Therapy immediately if the client’s benefit is canceled. If ** Therapy services are self-funded, then the child or legal guardian is responsible for payment of all direct and indirect care.”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** While not quite the same thing, my daughter’s endocrinologist charges $200/year to cover dealing with the prior authorizations and letters of medical necessity. I don’t think it’s ethical but don’t think it’s technically illegal

> **Response 2:** I know some offices charge the client/patient for reports. But cms/regulators has a max amount cap, like no more than $1/page, idk how much it is nowadays. 

The consult package, poc, progress note, discharge report all sounds like the CPT codes on super bills. They are trying to guarantee payments received, if not billed otherwise. 

But! If they are in network with your insurance and they confirmed that you have insurance, legally, according to cms, they cannot charge you these, they have to bill to your insurance & you can appeal their decisions too.

UPDATE: 

Just found out the payer has been sending payment to another PT group because the practitioner’s NPI is associated with that group as well (she works there prn). Has anyone encountered this?  I am at a loss for how to fix this.  

———————

One of our cash-pay clients has been submitting self-claims for reimbursement.  His insurance is BCBS Federal.  He has yet to receive any reimbursement.  Today he was told by his insurance company that "because the NPI is on the superbill, payment was sent to the PT practice..." (it wasn't); and, "the PT practice will need to reimburse you for these funds and there's nothing else we can do for you."  Basically, they have told him (falsely) that we, the PT group, have been receiving reimbursement for his already-paid-for cash services.  Except we haven't received a dime!  It's so ridiculous that I don't know who to call in order to straighten it out.  Plus, I don't have time to be on the phone arguing this as a solo practitioner / owner.  Has anyone else dealt with this?  Honestly, every self-claim attempt my patients have made, regardless of payer, has led to some level of headache and frustration for both the patient, and for me.  It's maddening.  Any advice appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have the patient ask for the check number and payment date.

> **Response 2:** Possible that they have/will sent paper checks and you are yet to receive. I would call and talk to the provider/claims department and get more info first and foremost to find out what’s going on. They are a big company and typically helpful via customer support. It will get sorted out.

Second, sounds like it may be worth your while to learn how to submit OON claims on behalf of your patients. It is a nice service to offer, very easy, and can probably increase your revenue long term and eliminate a lot of these headaches you describe.

We file out of network for some clients but usually most clients pay prompt pay discount and self submit superbill. We recently had an insurance where their OON deductible was only $200 so we filed for them and they only pay about $26 per visit which is no where near what we were expecting. How would you/have you handled with a current patient on caseload? 
1. Just have all patient self submit superbills although some insurances do pay well OON so may miss out on some additional $
1. Have them sign something similar to an ABN if courtesy billing OON and letting them know they will be responsible for any unpaid CPT codes up to the prompt pay discount? Is this balanced billing if the insurance is completely not paying for CPT codes like 97110 even with GP mod, etc. 
1. Other recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #compliance - Crystal - many factors at play, including each insurance plan's coverage of OON benefits. Of note, there are issues of balance billing, and legal requirements of the Good Faith Estimate that come into play. (Does your website provide the mandatory notice of the "Right to A Good Faith Estimate"?)  

Not "legal" advice .... but may assist in your risk assessment moving forward....

> **Response 2:** It sounds like this ins.(hmo) is processing this claim in network.

There is a shortage of PTs and PTAs, can I hire an athlete trainer, pilates instructor and Bill it under thera ex? I know with medicare that is unacceptable but can I do that with BCBS, Aetna? Humana? United health care?

I'm 46 yrs old, when did it change? Back in the days a massage therapist would do the exercise or massage since the PT had a patient every 30 minutes?

I'm a lymphedema and pelvic therapist now so I always get 1 hr one on one time so I was not aware of the changes

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I realize this is a legitimate question so I hope my answer is well received. 
Please do not hire and bill therapy procedures for an individual who is not a licensed and qualified PT or PTA. In the past I fought long and hard to keep said skilled services under the “PT only” domaine.  
Thank you.

> **Response 2:** If you are billing for skilled PT, that means a licensed PT or PTA.

I have a patient I am seeing who has Parkinson’s Disease.  She also requires OT/ ST but I don't offer those services as I am solo/PT. 

A call from her primary MD office, they said she needs to get the other services as well but cannot work with 2 different companies so they have to be discharge from me for them to get all 3 services from a company like Fox Rehab. Not sure how true this is? 

Pt does not have Medicare insurance,  has a Medicare Advantage plan. Family/pt doesn't want to stop her PT with me. 

Any OT/ST in Piscataway NJ area?

This is an official Medicare government test you must take to sell Medicare advantage plans   Read that and tell me if it makes any sense 👀 keep in mind. This is a 2026 test because open enrollment starts this week.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wow! That is interesting. Haven’t heard a thing about HH services being limited at 100 days/year. But if I’m being honest, this wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest. It’s limited in SNF. OP coverage is limited by many insurances. Why not HH?

> **Response 2:** Its the basis of how medicare works and advantage plans follow the guildelines they just "manage" it a lot more. Medicare A/"advantage" A allows for up to 100 days of consecutive services (typically paid at days 1-20 100%, then often 80% after. If all consecutive services are used the patient has 60 days were they must remain out of the hospital to reset med A benefits. Although i did have one patient that exhausted his lifetime medicare A benefits which is wild. Med B benefits never really go out. Where these "advantage plans" screw you though is they really like to dictate how much therapy theyre willing to give under both a & b and it has to often be pre-authorized and sometimes they even dictate what codes we use vs medicare who lets us do our thing and give the best services we can. New flash: theres absolutely no advantage to an advantage plan.

It says it did not meet the timed service requirement outlined in Medicare ch 15 section 220.

**Community Responses:**

Of note, Time In and Time Out are not required per Medicare or UHC. It is currently being required by Anthem in certain states for PT (primarily NH) but being actively disputed.

Mobile PT in FL!  
I noticed different chiropractic offices in my area “Now Offering Physical Therapy”  

Announcing that the PTA will be working alongside the chiropractors.  

I always thought a PTA needed to be supervised by a licensed PT??  Am I missing something?  And, how can they do this if PT supervision is required?
  
Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Suggest asking your state association to look into this.  Not sure about Florida, but in Michigan "physical therapy" is a protected term:  Chiropractors can perform/bill the same CPTs as PTs, but they can not advertise it as physical therapy services.

> **Response 2:** Chiros can bill PT CPT codes - ther ex, ther act, neuro, manual without a PT or  PTA present.   One in my area bills PT visit and has an LMT do massage.  We found that out when patient ran out of PT visits on insurance when we were the only place she went for PT, but chiro billing PT session for massage.

hello, i received a 1099 from UHC, however my patient has already prepaid me. One time they had told me to sign in digitally and get my check. Another time, they didn't answer or respond to any of my multiple calls, and still got a check, which I signed over to them because insurance was owed to them , (Not me). how do I
1. make it more crystal clear on the invoice that they do NOT pay me back, they owe the $ to the patient. it already says balance = $0, please pay patient
1. reverse this so that it doesn't show that they paid me

Question: I am a contract employee for a Pediatric Outpatient clinic. They are encouraging us to "bill an extra unit," for certain insurance companies after client's deductibles have been met. They are stating there is no additional cost to the consumer. They are advising us to use our clinical judgement as to whether or not the client would benefit from additional therapy. Our sessions are 45 minutes. Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm in Michigan where it's primarily Primary Health and BCBS. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** “Billing an extra unit” wiithout an appropriate amount of extra billable time spent with the patient is fraud. Period.

Using your clinical judgement to see if they need more therapy is always a good idea. But just billing an extra unit and justifying it because the patient doesn’t pay is… fraud.

> **Response 2:** In order to bill for the extra until you would need to treat the patient longer. If you treated for a longer duration then you should absolutely bill for that added unit. If not then you’re committing fraud

One of the things that may scare me out of trying to start my own business is the cost of health insurance. I will have to have health insurance for myself, my wife and hopefully for children in the near future. Is there anyone who has been there and done it? I’ve heard cost of purchasing insurance in the marketplace is insanely expensive which makes me question if it’s all worth it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use CHM (Christian Healthshare Ministries) …similar to Medishare that was mentioned above. We’re a family of four and have no complaints so far.

> **Response 2:** We use Zion Health share plan and have a Health Matching Account for health related expenses. It costs me $500 less per month than my employer sponsored health insurance through Humana last year. And $300 of the total that I pay per month is going into my HMA which I can actually USE instead of paying all that extra money to then have to meet a deductible. We are a healthy family of 4 with no major health problems or concerns. It was a little hard this year because we just started this plan and didn’t have much saved in the HMA yet. But going forward I feel like the HMA will cover the small expenses and then Zion will cover anything over $1000 per need.

I have a new OON practice. Right now about 3k in claim reimbursement / month. Billing service is quoting $450/month or 7% (for the first 6 months). States they are a boutique billing company and can also help with some light insurance verifications. Is this a good rate?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'd recommend, as an owner of a billing company, to look for a contract with a 30 day walk away policy. For example, my clients sign a contract, but can give me 30 days notice at any time. And 7% isn't high for your volume. It goes down the higher your volume gets. I specialize in small/growing businesses. This is because I love guiding the new provider. I do recommend doing it on your own for a bit, but if your time is better spent marketing, etc, get a biller. 😉

> **Response 2:** If you have time, then I woyld recommend learning how to do it yourself.  If you get busier and need to delgate, then you will understand what you are hiring and overseeing.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** This is a warning only. Just go ahead and submit. You are good. This is standard as your business does not have a current Medicare ID. I do credentialing all the time for people and this is the standard procedure.

Hi Everyone! 
If you are seeing private clients and not taking insurance, what steps do you need to take to be able to provide super bills for people?
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Super easy to build a template. I’ve adapted mine a couple of times but feel pretty happy with it these days and haven’t had problems with it.

> **Response 2:** I use PtEverywhere as my EMR and my clients automatically receive a super bill after I have completed the note. All through the app and I don’t have to actively do anything. Pretty awesome!

Hey friends. United healthcare MA patient getting denied for ROHO cushion secondary to them saying she “doesn’t have a buttock wound”…she’s got MS and has been wheelchair bound and total assist for more than 2 years…any suggestion of another cushion that may be covered? We’ve been working on this for MONTHS and now they come back and say that. She has a gel cushion already that is very uncomfortable. Any suggestions welcome.

I own a cash based PT clinic in Colorado. I have a patient who recently tried submitting a super bill that I provided to this patient, to their insurance co which is United Healthcare. UHC did not deny the claim but put it on a temporary hold requesting more info from me the provider. The info that they are requesting are things such as provider first and last name, NPI number, tax ID number etc. A list of items that are already clearly stated on the super bill that was submitted. They are also requesting patient’s medical records. Is this normal? Has anyone else dealt with something similar?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just went through the same exact thing with them. I've been working on it for a couple of months & my pt just let me know they got paid at least a couple of weeks ago 🤦‍♀️ even though I've gotten more paperwork from them. Now to just catch up with the remaining ones I hadn't even submitted yet. 🙄

> **Response 2:** I’ve billed UHC two times (same patient). They paid the first one and then put a hold on the second one for lack of info. They said I needed to submit my W9, which I had done months ago. I think this is just what UHC does and one of the reasons why everyone hates them.

Dear hivemind, inspiration needed. Thinking of future possibilities, how likely am I to succeed with a cash-based PT & Wellness practice in upstate NY?

Reasons for doubt: abundance of insurance-based PT clinics.

We - fam - are thinking of moving to upstate NY. Currently I work in OP PT, insurance based. 

But I can’t bear thinking of owning/running my PT business with insurance.

Please help with info/inspiration, ideas for R&R

TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m out in the Rochester NY area, so a different market, but my family is in New Paltz and the surrounding area. New Paltz is bursting with people who have moved from NYC who probably have cash to spend for the convenience and quality you would be offering. That might be more difficult in Catskill. Just a little too far from NYC

> **Response 2:** Where in upstate NY are you thinking (out of curiosity more than anything)? I am near Saratoga, have been solely cash-based since I started up 3+ years ago. It’s been slow to build up, but I also have not invested a ton of time or money directly into building because of how my life is and how I want it to be (meaning, I have a lot of other endeavors, and don’t want to be treating multiple patients/day, every day, and also don’t need this to rely on for income). I think it can be whatever you want it to be, as long as you know what energy it’s going to take to get to that point.

I am looking for examples of owners whom have started a formal profit sharing program for employees. I’m at the point where I am very ok with my employee taking home a generous portion of the profits she generates. I’m not ok with giving her generous raises with future earnings that don’t exist yet. I was thinking I would take the actual profit she generates after the expense of her - create a tiered percentage like 
3% of profits from 0-25k , 5% 25 -50k and so on …. 
Does anyone have an example of this in legal ease or how other industries present this to employees? 

I know this does have an impact on how much a person can put in 401k 

As an owner I can give myself this profit share as well and it can allow me to add money above the individual max to 401k 

Is there other aspects it would impact that I’m not thinking of?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I had profit sharing from a previous employer it was a certain monthly, quarterly, and yearly when a certain threshold was met for personal, clinic, and company. It was given to me in my regular earnings so it had taxes taken out and was part of the contribution calculated into my % of 401k and matching if applicable.

> **Response 2:** Great thought! I am taking a business class right now that brought this point up in class this week. It is a 10 week class, but I will try to remember and ask for an elaboration on this point. Stay tuned.

I believe you can claim either mileage OR expenses on the vehicle, not both.

We bill as an out of network providers and still figuring out what can we do if it’s not a Medicare advantage plan.
If our self pay rate is $140, and we bill the insurance and gets reimbursed $80, can we then bill the patient the difference?

Some plans do say that after deductible is met they covered 100% after deducitbke is met, but it’s still like $80. Can we balance bill even though it says that the plan will cover 100%?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How do you bill out of network with non Medicare advantage? 

Do you just provide clients a superbill or with like UHC or BCBS you just submit billing for them and send a w9?

> **Response 2:** It should say on the bill what they allow you to charge based on units if they pay 80 they will probably say the patient owes a certain amount and u can charge them whatever that says

All guidance/opinions welcome and would be greatly appreciated! 

I’m a mobile physical therapist that owns my own mobile clinic and I’m the only employee…therefore, I am doing all the billing through my EMR system, scheduling patients, administrative work and of course, treating patients.
I started my clinic one month ago and already have a full schedule working 8-5 Monday through Thursday.

I am only in network with Medicare right now and do cash based for all other patients but provide them with a superbill upon their request.

I am trying to decide whether to become in network with Blue Cross Blue Shield or stay OON. 
How difficult are they to work with? (I’m in Kansas) 
Do you typically see better reimbursement from them than Medicare?
Almost all of my cash patients (about 3-4 patients) pays the full amount upfront… would I be chasing Payment down from patients or do you typically see that patients do a good job of paying their remaining balance whether insurance pays very much or not? 
Would I have to pay attention to an amount that I would need to write off if BCBS does not pay the fullamount or do my patients pay the difference between the billed amount and what Blue Cross Blue Shield pays?

Thank you for any insight and your opinions on whether I should become in-network or stay OON with BCBS. I am very new to this and don’t want to get in over my head as I don’t want to feel like I can’t keep up with the billing side as well as treating patients. 

P.S. thank you to everyone for all your posts which helped encourage me to step out on my own… I’m absolutely loving it and it is the best thing for our growing family now and in the future 😃￼

> **Response 1:** OON /cash.  Best combo

This is the decision from United Seniors Association, Inc. v. Shalala and used as a major reason for why Cash PT to Medicare patients is not allowed.

Chevron was overturned by SCOTUS yesterday. The entire conversation around cash PT has changed. What exactly this means… who knows. But the conversation has changed, bigly.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What is the source for his comment "used as a major reason for why Cash PT to Medicare patients is not allowed." 

From my perspective the cart may be before the horse - as during the time when the PT rumors starting flying around about "cash and PT" when the HITECH law was put in play........ (not true - no secret clause" - that invokes Medicare and cash).

> **Response 2:** Hope this discussion isn’t limited to just PT and includes all therapies.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I informed my patients or their assistants to handle this all before I begin. ￼ I tell them clearly that I don’t participate and I do not have an office to handle any pre-authorizations. That they will receive a super bill with codes, but sometimes that is not enough for your specific insurance requirements. ￼

> **Response 2:** I would suggest to you that you need to make a decision on which way to go.  Either call and check out-of-network benefits for the patient and let them know. Or be upfront and let the patient know that it is up to them to find out if they have out of network benefits for themselves.

Hello. Now that I am credentialed with Medicare, will I need to be credentialed with each separate Medicare advantage plan such as Aetna Medicare in order to fully be paid?Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi. Crucial clarification here: Is the Aetna plan a supplemental? (I think it'll say so on their insurance card.)

You only ever need to be in network with the primary payer -- the primary payer will automatically send the remainder of the (approved) bill to the supplemental. You'll get a check in the mail from the supplemental later; timing varies. 

If the Aetna plan is their primary plan, then it's a Medicare replacement. Don't bother going in network with those, generally speaking, unless you have really good reasons. If their plan has OON benefits for PT, they reimburse at the same rates as Medicare would have. 

Please feel free to set up a call with me if you need more guidance -- since we've chatted about some of these things already.

> **Response 2:** understabd Medicare (dis)Advantage plans are NOT MEDICARE.  They are commercial insurance.  So if you are going to hassle with them then yes you will have to credential with each one.  Unless they have OON BENEFITS and you want to hassle witg that!  Good luck.  Sorry for my negative bias regarding said Disadvantage plans.  🤣

Thanks so much!
Edited to add: they already use medicare services but want extra hours of cash PT each week outside of their medicare services

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You must bill Medicare for medically necessary skilled therapy services. Clients are not allowed to pay cash for these services. If they are received wellness services (be clear on how you define this) that are not covered by Medicare then there is no form that they need to sign.  If the services might normally be covered but do not meet the skilled therapy medically necessary code outlined in Section 220.2 of CMS Chapter 15 then  you will need to have the client sign an ABN. Here is the link to Chapter 15 https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/bp102c15.pdf   Here is a link on how to correctly complete an ABN. https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/BNI/Downloads/ABN-Form-Instructions.pdf

I have prospective pt who is ex military, and she says she got approved for therapy. I don't take insurance, but she says this isn't insurance it's just a code that's submitted to the VA for reimbursement, and then "they pay for it".

Does anyone have experience getting paid through the VA? Do you have to be on an approved list of providers?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In Arizona, the VA sends us an authorization, typically for 15 visits. We cannot treat VA patients and have it covered by the VA without it. We are part of the VA community care network. Depending on the state you are in,  it may vary though.

> **Response 2:** I do out of network Tricare, call Humana Tricare in your area. It’s super easy as you just send in your license and ask for “out of network” Tricare number.  Put that number on your reciept and you can at least have them get reimbursed for out of network tricare (in network is a pain) and frankly they are getting about 65%+ reimbursement so hassle is less for both of you and  tge patient and considering what I do that is not reimbursed with laser etc I’m actually a better deal than in network (except post op since it takes so long)
Good luck.

Hello! I am new here. I am currently working on starting a private pay outpatient clinic on my own. I live in colorado so wanted to avoid insurance due to the capped reimbursement with commercial insurances, but was curious what people’s thoughts are on being in-network with Medicare?? Is it worth it at all?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did that prior to switching to health and wellness. Medicare was pretty easy to navigate and I was paid within 3 weeks and never had issues. I had one instance of a denial and I threw in a code to go over cap and was paid for those visits. Wasn’t my favorite but my location had a great deal of geriatric referrals. I did that a year and decided I despise all the rules, tracking down docs to sign notes, etc so moved to wellness instead. I’m also in CO. You can look up the par provider reimbursement rates online using the novitas online portal. If doing Medicare, I highly recommend signing up for this Portal, esp for any insurance verifications. I also heard that legally you can’t bill Medicare private pay for PT services so that was another reason I got in network

> **Response 2:** What type of clients/practice? If geriatrics.. yes!!

Hello colleagues, 
I recently applied with Blue Shield as an individual out-of-network provider so that my clients can be reimbursed through the super bill I provide them with. Since I operate as a mobile PT, I provided them with my virtual office address . However, my application was not processed because it is not a physical address. As a mobile PT, I do not have a physical address. If any of you have faced a similar situation, how did you resolve it? Did you provide a different address or find another solution? I was hoping not to provide my home address.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are businesses set up where their actual business is to act as a physical address for this purpose. I’m trying to recall what they are called. I’m also wondering though why apply to be OON. As a cash based therapist I’m just automatically out of network. I give super bills and then families submit them if they’d like to but their reimbursement as to do with if their plan offers OON benefits or not. Not me applying to be an OON provider.

> **Response 2:** I am in-network with BCBS so I could be wrong here, however it is strange that you would need to apply as an OON provider.

I work with many insurances OON and there way no application. Submit claims (or have the patient do it) and they will respond to the claims with era/payment if applicable. They may ask for a W9.

I’m wondering if anyone can answer a couple questions for me.  I just started taking Medicare patients. (I feel like I sold my soul to the devil). Got some questions about coding.  I went cross-eyed trying to find the answers yesterday.  With regard to G codes, does Medicare still require those?

I also have questions about the 59 code and the new X codes I’ve been reading about.  I tend to bill 97112, 97110, and 97140 together quite a bit.  Does anybody know if that combination requires any of those codes? 

Lastly, I don’t understand the proper use of the “GP” code. Can anybody clarify that for me too? Thank you.

I have downloaded over 100 pages of Medicare billing manual. But I’m really struggling to find that information.  Thanks again.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No G codes anymore thankfully. GP modifier is added to all codes (performed by a PT). 59 is only needed with certain codes to essentially confirm that they were separate procedures and not performed concurrently. You'll want to look at the list for all of those combos. For example, I treat vestibular patients, so I use a 59 when billing a repositioning maneuver and Neuro re-ed in same visit.

> **Response 2:** G codes are no longer a thing!   I would totally recommend hitting up Anthony Maritato and his courses zero to paid!  Or do a lot of googling!

Called BCBS to find out why a claim was paid at $0 (no reason given on Ability). Tried typing claim number several times, no luck.. tried speaking it very clearly 10 times and it kept getting it wrong…. On the 11th try it finally repeated it back correctly and said it would connect me 🥳….. then it disconnected me 🤬

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have had multiple claims denied by BCBS recently and we have prior authorization for all CPT codes requested… so mad

> **Response 2:** Update: 30 minutes on hold finally got someone.  Was told that the correct status of the claim is being displayed in Availity (we use Ability as our clearinghouse) and they cannot give out the information over the phone and I will need to look on Availity

Jane or HelloNote & why? 
Private practice of 1 OT, pediatric population, with a hybrid practice of insurance & private pay options!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HelloNote beat Jane in every category for me when I was looking 2 yrs ago. The support is great, and I feel like we’re on the same team. In the past, I’ve felt like some EMRs made my life more challenging. My only gripe is the lack of robust reports directly within the app. You have to copy and paste some things into Excel. Not sure about Jane for that

> **Response 2:** Hellonote seemed better to me for insurance. I have a hybrid neuro practice and I’ve used Jane before.

Hellonote is nicer to keep track of stuff for insurance. It also has integrated fax and billing if those are important.

With all things being equal, which is better: cash-based, or billing insurance? 
If you are cash-based, has anyone ever had patients that file for insurance reimbursement themselves? 
If you bill insurance, how difficult is it to get set up as a provider and file claims? Did you have to hire someone to do this, or did you do it yourself? Has it been worth it?
Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It depends on if you want to deal with insurance or not.  And if your area has clients willing to pay privately.

> **Response 2:** What do you mean by all things being equal? They’re 2 very different models with different pros and cons.

We recently heard that another popular PT clinic (that is in-network with UHC) in our area is charging UHC patients $30 on top of in-network rates. Has anyone else heard of this practice / is this legal?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are in network that means there is a contract in place. The contracts typically indicate that you accept the insurances payment as full payment of covered services regardless of what your normal rate is. If a service isn't covered, then that's a different story.

> **Response 2:** Let's play devils advocate for second. You charge these 30 dollars for dry needling/sports stretching a non covered service for the extra unit they don't want you to bill etc then how is that balance billing? Truth is UHC wants you to bill under 3-3.5 average units to stay preferred provider. They (big insurance) use lobbyist , loop holes to screw providers.if company see patient for 40 min for UHC 2-3 unit then provide a non skilled unit for an additional fee. That is agreed upon, then what's the issue? IMO go OON with ASh (Cigna) , UHC . However if we all do that then big box corporate stores win and further degrade the life of our #caged colleagues.

I have a patient who is in hospice and reached out to me wanting to do PT sessions s/p TSA. I told them I needed to lookup if I can do this as cash even though they are on hospice. Hospice doesn't have PT and the patient is homebound. Any insight?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following. I had a patient on hospice. She had a Medicare replacement plan, which I have successfully billed as an OON provider several times prior to hospice starting.

But recently got a letter from her insurance stating that they made a mistake in paying me while she was receiving hospice services. Doesn't make sense to me, since she doesn't use Medicare and the representative I spoke to said it would be fine for me to treat her OON while she was receiving home health (traditionally Medicare A).

So idk.

> **Response 2:** We’ve had patients on hospice as private pay and there wasn’t a problem.

The leaders here and crew are tremendous and I have officially decided to launch my Mobile Practice here in South Jersey, but I do have to go about this by accepting some insurances at this time.  I am credentialed with Traditional MCR Part B and Horizon, but waiting on a few things before I can actually start seeing people and being able to bill.  I am also thinking of becoming credentialed with AETNA, AETNA MCR, AMERIHEALTH, and maybe another, but need to learn more about the In and Out of Network ways of doing things and if it makes sense to go one way versus another.  Does anyone have some good insight and knowledge that can provide me with some help and guidance on this?  Please free to comment or reach out to me on DM.  Thank you Team!

Hi everyone, I need your input. I started a mobile practice few months ago and hoping to open a physical location hopefully within the year. As a start up, and considering to be credentialed by insurance, what are your top 6 choices just to get you through while building up your case load? I’m in NJ. Thank you 😀

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in nj and this also depends on if your mobile- some from what I’ve heard aren’t worth it. Message me if you have more questions

> **Response 2:** I’m credentialed with BCBS and Medicare. I recommend BCBS because you can take any states policy which is huge. Recommend Medicare because you can’t provide PT to people with Medicare unless you take their insurance.

Pre-Authorization BCBS HMO
Hi all, I had a case and it was my first time working with BCBS HMO (I’m in network with HMO). My claims denied due to lack of pre authorization. From what I know, it is ok to made up  pre authorization although the evaluation and treatments were already finished. However, I am getting conflict informations from BCBS and PCP’s office. BCBS required pre authorization filled out by PCP; whereas PCP said they never done that, it’s the PT clinic should request pre authorization from insurance company. So I’m stuck in the middle. I only have 90 days to ask for pre authorization retrospectively, yet I couldn’t move forward and I’m loosing the days now. Any suggestions? What’s the correct approach? Any insight will be much appreciated. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PCP should call BCBS that they are referring their patient to you. PCP will need your NPI. You can evaluate or treat patient once you have the referral or authorization code. May not be paid for your evaluation and treatment before the start of authorization.

> **Response 2:** We work with BCBS in WI and when pre-auth is required we need to request it as the treating therapist/facility. The information usually includes clinical information like an outcome measure, which the PCP wouldn’t be able to provide. I’ve never heard of retro authorization, but if you are planning to continue to see the client you might be able to request authorization now for future visits.

Has anyone switched from taking insurance to a cash based clinic? I have a pediatric clinic that is doing really well but insurance is burning me out and I am working way too many hours because insurance reimbursement isn’t great. I’m really interested in doing cash based and switching back to home visits. Wondering if it’s doable or a terrible idea.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm used to run an insurance based clinic. I left and started my own mobile outpatient that is cash based. 

I'm not sure what area you're in, but in the Atlanta area I've had several people reach out asking specifically for a pediatric PT that would travel to their home.

> **Response 2:** It’s all about being able to have the appropriate conversations with patients. Often times I see clinicians struggle with being able to have the money conversations and overcome insurance objections. If you can do that well even if you cut your caseload in half if you’re charging enough it shouldn’t affect your income.

Hi Gang,   

We no longer bill insurance for clients (we stopped almost 20 years ago). 

However, a client wants a statement with the codes itemized to submit for possible reimbursement.  

If billing for a 75-minute session, incorporating 4 modalities, do we need modifier -59? (97112 x 2, 97530, 97140 x 2)    

Or, what's the best way to show the breakdown so they have the best chance of receiving the highest OON reimbursement?  

Thanks, 
Irene Diamond

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have never included any sort of modifier, simply the CPT codes and amount charged for each code. For reimbursement, the superbill may need certain info on it like time and place of service, NPI, EIN (tax number), license number. Hope this helps!

> **Response 2:** Is there a reference page for the codes with 59 modifiers?

So in a cash based setting, I can provide super bills for people to submit on their own, correct? Does that automatically make those claims out of network though?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Kelly! I just asked something very similar. To my understanding, if I’m cash based and provide a super bill, then the patients can submit it and get reimbursed based on their plan.

Some language I have been using is that reimbursement is not guaranteed - it’s based on your specific plan but I will provide everything they should need

But I asked today about tricare - because my patient on Friday said that I need to be listed with them in order for her to get reimbursed

> **Response 2:** Correct! Burden is on the client to submit for reimbursement for your services from any out of network benefits they may have.

I’m looking for advice on if there are legal guidelines for owning a cash based practice as a PTA/PT. 
Any input and advice appreciated 🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What State?!

> **Response 2:** I have done the same in Florida.  The only authority outside of federal insurance is your practice act and you may find they don’t even mention it as most of the per visit type rules are insurance driven. 
There are rules about taking various patients from Medicare, Medicaid and federal insurances though. 
Best wishes!

**Community Responses:**

I’m new to Arizona, and I know PTs here just recently got approved to order imaging. I want to order a MRI for a client (Medicare) who I’ve been treating for hip pain. Anyone know how to do this? I called Medicare and they said it just needs to be “medically necessary” and they will cover it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your practice act may say that you can order imaging, but please read Medicare guidelines and don't go based off what a representative is telling you because they are frequently wrong. For instance, PTs can fit for pessaries; however,  Medicare doesn't reimburse if done by a PT. I'm not sure of this answer,  but would hate for the person to get stuck with this bill and be under the impression that Medicare will cover it.

And your original post says family member. Please remember that you can't bill Medicare if the person is family and Medicare also explains this in their guidelines. Also,  review your state practice act to find out if they allow this as well. 

(PS- even though you updated your post,  the original post is still available to be seen. Just in case you are wondering)

> **Response 2:** Here in Colorado, I’m a provider registered with Colorado Springs Imaging and can directly place orders through the online portal. Colorado Springs Imaging schedules the patient and handles the insurance billing. Sometimes the imaging center requests my notes faxed stating medically necessary.

Quick question:   With direct access do we, as PT’s, need to be concerned with which ICD 10 codes we are using?   I come from a time when it was really emphasized that we do not diagnose, so my brain goes in circles when I’m trying to figure out which codes to put that apply.   Maybe I’m over thinking it, but if I understand using CPT codes correctly, there are certain ones that we can use and cannot use.  I just wasn’t sure if that applies to ICD 10 codes, as well.  I do realize that the type of coding might be more relevant to billing and reimbursement, but I’m just creating a super bill with codes on it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What population are you treating? If it’s ortho, just keep it simple- m25.561 (R knee pain), m25.612 (L shoulder stiffness), etc

> **Response 2:** Some codes have initial encounter vs. subsequent encounter. If they’re coming direct access I will use initial encounter. If they’re coming from a MD referral, I use subsequent encounter.

> **Response 1:** I just asked my accountant if it was a verified business expense for my business to pay my monthly premium and he said it was. 🤷🏻‍♀️

> **Response 2:** Talk to your CPA. You are fine I believe but my understanding is to do that you have to offer the coverage to all employees. When the Affordable Care Act kicked in this changed. You could do it before. This is as an S corp

Hello everyone I am in the process of becoming uncaged and owning my own clinic. But I am concerned with finding an insurance that I can look into getting for my wife, son, and I that would cover health, dental, and vision and not overly priced. Any suggestions where I can start looking?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look into the health sharing plans like Christian Healthcare Ministries-and then sign up with a direct care physician ($50-65 per month) you will be shocked at got cheap things are through your direct care physician -antibiotics $6, blood pressure meds-$ 8 blood work $29 -so much cheaper than insurance!!

> **Response 2:** We went through a local insurance broker for our 2026 insurance. We were previously using insurance through my husband's work but needed a change for 2026 because our premiums were going to be sky high when we only go to the doctor for wellness visits and maybe 1 urgent care visit a year. We got a much better quote compared to what marketplace was offering.

Posting anonymously as announcement has not been made to staff or clients. 
Before I sever all insurance contracts, I want to be sure I have at lease a minimal understanding of what I need to do and what I’lbe asking clients to do.
I HAVE to maintain Medicare relationship but can give pt superbill?  If that is terminated then the client cant submit, correct?

All other commercial insurances I need to sever our contract, and pt can submit superbill I provide them with?

What do Medicare advantage plans look like for this? 

What troubles have you or your patients found with submission & reimbursement?  
I want to support them and make this process simple (if that’s possible) and provide some reassurance that they will get reimbursed, but it feels like that’s not my promise to make. 
I truly appreciate any advice, direction, & thoughts. 
Thank you 🙏  on

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can't provide re assurance that they will be reimbursed from their commercial carrier.    Can't charge Medicare patients cash (legally) for skilled services (less dedctibles) regardless of your relationship with them.

> **Response 2:** And just a thought but these will all go to the OON deductible that is different then in network deductible so they often end up paying cash anyway.

Hey all! I am about to start really trying to get my business off the ground. It’s a mobile cash/med B business and I established it a year ago and started with a mentoring group. Due to unforeseen family circumstances I took about 4 months away and was not seeing clients. Now that I’m back I’m re-evaluating things. While the mentoring group was immensely helpful in the beginning I feel like at this point I want to work with what I’ve learned and just start seeing clients for a bit. I’m shopping around for EMR and phone options and trying to decide if I stay on a monthly mentorship program or if I try to trim expenses for the time being and just get a client base built up. 

Is anyone who is a solo practitioner who takes cash and Medicare willing to share their average costs for phone and EMR? Right now I’m with hellonote/high level but the costs are bundled with the mentoring so it’s difficult to tease them apart. I’ve spoke with a ring central rep and looked at Jane for EMR. Just trying to iron out all the details and feel comfortable where money is going. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What is your Medicare B to cash ratio?
- asking because if you are not seeing very many Medicare clients, maybe you just go cash for a while & document using Google Drive. 
- if you are set on an EMR and looking for a good balance between inexpensive and functional, look at PT everywhere. May not have the bells and whistles, but it’s a solid product and nearly built specifically for a cash or cash and Medicare practice.
- I do believe that a CRM (I’ve come to believe go HighLevel specifically) is an invaluable tool for independent business owners. It may be worth your while to speak with the guys at Uncaged. While I won’t comment on price specifically I can testify to the fact that they believe you should own your own data. They also back up those words with action.
- I have been running my phone through HighLevel for the last six months with minimal problems (any issues were entirely my creating).
- Even if you paid me, I could not go back to hello note. Lots of unrealized promises and unnecessary complexity. ￼￼

> **Response 2:** I just started using stride a few months ago and pay for a cheap cellphone. I have a brick and mortar but see a mix of cash and insurances. There’s no monitoring but it’s much cheaper than what you’re paying!

Pros and cons of billing insurance vs cash pay for private OT, lymphedema therapist and Graston specialist. Insurance seems overwhelming to me but maybe it’s worth it? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What age? If your doing Medicare age. Recommend Medicare and OON or Cash otherwise. But depends on state, etc.

> **Response 2:** Billing insurance provides financial security and attracts a broader client base, but it comes with administrative burdens. Cash pay simplifies the process, offering flexibility but may limit clients. Assess your priorities and client demographics to decide what aligns best with your practice.

**Community Responses:**

One of my major hold ups is knowing approximate total annual costs.  I've seen folks discuss HPSO vs CMF insurance costs.  EMR rates, Fax rates, etc.  I would like to know what your total approximate annual expenses are.

I'd appreciate being able to see numbers of single owners of their total annual approximate costs.  I know it will vary by state and mobile vs brick and mortar.  DM or comment.  Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Last year my total expenses were just under $14,000. That included my EMR, a billing service, insurance, faxing, quick books, purchasing a new MacBook and massage table as well as a few charitable donations. My largest expense was by far paying for billing if you start out doing that yourself you can save a lot of money and add it in later if you need to. You will also need to factor in continuing education.

> **Response 2:** solo, brick and mortar-500$ year HPSO

I am sure this has been asked before. So when I sent a claim to Medicare they paid X for the services and 20% of it would be patient’s responsibility. The patient’s responsibility portion goes to seconds insurance (Medicaid). So if Medicaid doesn’t pay any of the patient’s responsibility, can I ask patient to pay the remainder? Please guide….

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If the secondary was not Medicaid then yes. But in this case, no.

> **Response 2:** Sadly, you cannot collect when Medicaid is the secondary, and Medicaid will likely not pay you the 20% because the Medicaid fee schedule is less than Medicare’s, and Medicaid will consider the therapy already paid in full.

I have a Medicare billing question that I am curious. I am almost credentialed with Medicare, and with that, being new to being mobile and on my own, I need some help. Is Medicare billing based off my location or the patient’s home? I assume it would be my location I have marked for my office, being my home address since I am mobile. I just wasnt sure, given that I have received two new referrals for patients at their home addresses outside of the area I have informed Medicare about in my application for credentialing! TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your business is your home address 

Billing you mark home ( mobile)

Someone with Medicare reached out to me for strength training and improving posture. I did the first visit and now they want to pay with their LTC insurance. I have not received any payment yet. They would be seen in their home and I am 100% cash pay only.

Can I see them as a wellness client if they want to use their LTC insurance and just supply a superbill? Their Medicare coverage is with Kaiser and they don't want to use it due to poor therapy received by them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If not doing physical therapy, I doubt insurance would pay...

> **Response 2:** Insurance 100% wont pay. Your “client” needs to pay in cash. Don’t use the word “patient” as that implies skilled care which is the physical therapy route

I’m a solo provider for my own clinic. I definitely made more money than I expected to last year which is great but I have a tax question for this year and didn’t know if anyone has had any similar  experiences. I don’t REALLY want to ask my accountant yet because I usually get charged an arm and a leg for questions and I’m not sure If it’s worth it.

My 3 week vacation in June ended up turning into 4 1/2 week vacation after getting REALLY sick with covid. So my income for this quarter is going to be a LOT lower. Should I contact him about lowering this quarters estimated taxes or should I just pay what my accountant had estimated for this quarter? 

I also don’t want to get fined for not paying enough when I do my taxes next year.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You won’t get fined for not paying estimated taxes. You’re essentially paying taxes on the front end to reduce paying on the back end. If you over pay then you’ll get a return. Prior to last year and this year I usually played the first two quarterly estimated taxes then my cpa would advise me to pay or not pay the last two.

> **Response 2:** Find a new CPA. A good one is really helpful and shouldn’t gouge you!

I did a business plan, that included a marketing plan with start up costs, 1st & 3 year projected financials . Lots of paperwork for an SBA loan. I am still in the thick of the process.

Hi all! Sorry if this is a silly question but I’m clueless 🤣 to all the very very small business owners or ones just starting out- what all did you do to prepare for taxes- how did you show your income to your CPA- what did you need to have if not a 1099?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I kept a spreadsheet throughout the year with a list of all of my expenses. Mileage, cell phone, fax service, EMR, wireless card for my laptop, supplies, LLC filing fees, courses, malpractice insurance, etc.  My accountant pretty much just wanted to know what I earned and what I spent.  After I gave him everything he told me next year to put my expenses in  particular categories but I don't have access at the moment.  Your CPA will guide you.  I had 1099s from Medicare and one of the insurance companies, two companies that I contact with but all of my cash pay patients were self-reported.

> **Response 2:** I use quickbooks and link it to my business bank account, so everything goes in automatically and I can login and see expenses/income etc. makes it really easy for tax time! Our accountant does a schedule C for me and runs numbers both ways (filing jointly or separately with my spouse) to see which way works better. Haven’t made enough yet to file separately though 😂

I am an LLC owner and got a ticket from a red light camera while driving for work (totally missed the no turn on red sign). Can I pay the fine with my business credit card since it occurred on my way to work, similar to buying gas? 

It's not a large fine and I'm happy to use my personal card if using the business card is a red flag or shady. Thanks for any insight, I couldn't find the answer to this online.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t think a traffic ticket is considered a business expense, but I’d ask your CPA to verify.

> **Response 2:** A traffic fine would not fall under the usual, necessary, and reasonable guidelines for business expenses as defined under IRS code sec.162(a).

Hello everyone!
I am new to selling things in my practice. I'm a mobile cash practice in Wisconsin.

I'd like to start having sets of bands for purchase.. other items including NMES/TENS units, loop bands, half foam roller etc. 

What am I required to have in order to legally sell them? Tax rules? 

Same question for merchandise (shirts, hats, etc)?

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you want to physically care stock or have an Amazon associates link that you can give people and have them order on their own?

If someone is using the VA for the home health, can we see them for Medicare part B?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are they admitted to VA Home Based Primary Care Program?  The team included PT.  Seems to be some confusion about receiving HBPC PT at the same time skilled home heath PT or Part B outpatient PT is used. The HBPC PT performs annual assessment at minimum and supports with additional visits for equipment assessment and trial, follow up training, HEP instruction, follow up assessment after hospitalization, maintenance intervention.  
So if the client is receiving HBPC, they may have Part B OR Part A PT services. 
VA is providing HHOT and HHST - for example in our catchment area, HHOT follows Part B documentation/billing and HHST follows Part A/skilled HH billing. 
All VA's are not the same due to location, availability of services etc.

> **Response 2:** It would be important to clarify if the veteran is referring to Home Based Primary Care (a VA service for homebound veterans that includes a NP, RN, SW, Dietician, Pharmacist, Psychologist, and rehab therapist: PT/OT). That is just primary care but in the home and veterans can still use Medicare Part B while enrolled in HBPC assuming they have Medicare Part B. Otherwise, home health is home health whether they are a veteran or not, and you would not be paid through Part B

Newbie- looking for resources and advice
I am a full-time outpatient PT (for over a decade) for a hospital system- and about ready to jump ship to my own cash-based +Medicare mobile PT gig. I am learning as much as I can online, but feel overwhelmed. How do I best learn how to get credentialed with Medicare, how to physically bill Medicare with Jane App (I am learning about what clearinghouses are 😅🥴), the ins/outs of cash based and taxes and accounting. I need someone to talk to me like I am 3 years old about this stuff- because I am NOT business-minded BUT I have a really great reputation in town with my population and local referring sources, and I can easily see how this could work really well for me if I dont flounder and fail with the business crap. Anyone else not have a business bone in their body and made this work??

Has anyone successfully billed BCBS PPO plan as an OON provider? 

I keep getting told different information but my Claim Md immediately rejects submission. When I called I was told it’s because my Florida blue number was tied to my maiden name and an old company I used to work with. 

When I submitted a non participating provider application as one customer service advised I was rejected because I’m a mobile provider. 

For other insurances I just sent a w9 so I’m confused with how can I bill. 

This client has OON benefits and a 40% coinsurance. 

They have no fax so is my only option to try to mail cms1500 forms with w9

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When you set up your clearinghouse you have to fill out the forms and agreements to bill electronically for each insurance. When I get a new OON one I get rejected for this sometimes and then I remember and have to enroll through the clearinghouse (not BCBS). Could that be the problem?

> **Response 2:** In my experience, Florida blue has been asking to get auth. Not sure, if that is why they rejecting you. I am mobile and getting paid with FL blue if I have auth.

I’m a solo therapist, I take Medicare and OON with all others. I’m swamped and super busy even with just taking Medicare. My question is,
Rather than hiring since I’m so busy, has anyone created a concierge package to offer clients ? Must be a member kind of thing ? The goal of course is to make more and work less, but I’m trying to figure out how to do that being solo and not hiring. If anyone has any input it’s greatly appreciated

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You may have to call it something else.  If u r in network with medicare, they may frown on charging their clients cash on top of being in network.  It could be construed as a foem of balance billing.

> **Response 2:** Use the Medicare covered episode to find out what makes them tick. “John’s Golf plan” with a goal to drive 150 yards. “Jim’s Skeet Shooting Plan” with a goal to be able to handle a 12 gauge etc
$1000-2000 a month. 

“Fall prevention” plans are kind of lame, nobody wants that. Need to address what motivates them

Write out a cool plan, laminate it. Make it look exciting and deliver it in a folder 1-2 weeks before discharge and let them talk about it with their family.

I’ve been told that no commercial insurance shares their fee schedule until one credentials. However, it would really help to make this decision of credentialing with some private insurance s such as BCBC, Aetna, Anthem etc if someone is willing to share an estimate of what the reimbursement looks like for such insurances, if your outpatient practice already credentials with them? I have a mobile PT practice and based in CA, if it helps.
Thank you 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You might try staying out of network for higher reimbursement rates, it also gives you a chance to see what those OON rates are, if you are able to get OON coverage for most of your clients, and see which insurance companies are the most popular in your area (probably the best reason to go in network is if you have a lot of patients coming in with BCBS, for example).  Then you can apply for in network status, as someone already mentioned, and choose whether to accept or decline- because they will not give you a fee schedule if you are not in network and most will have you sign a contract saying you cannot share their in network rates- but they might give them to you if you are about to sign an in network contract.

> **Response 2:** This is all very very helpful to know and make this credentialing decision accordingly. Thank you so much 🙏😍 love this group and everyone’s willingness to share and help!!

Asking for pros and cons between two different EMRs: HENO & Prompt. Tell me what you love and don’t love/wish it had.

We are Multidisciplinary, mobile only geriatric/neuro clinic that accepts Medicare and cash.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have the same population and set up as you (except I’m mobile). 

Happy to chat if you wanna DM but I agree with Heidi. The billing side saves me oodles of time. The customer service is top notch and they listen to clinicians and ideas. They’re working on adding some things I’ve suggested! Woohoo!

Edit to add: we use prompt. I didn’t specify that in my original post reply 🥴 we’ve used it a little over a year now I think

> **Response 2:** I don't know HENO but I do know Prompt. Pros: 1 click claim submission. Billing is a one stop shop. No logging on to another platform to load claims/ERA'S, etc. That saves a TON of time. Built for Medicare compliance. Customer Service is phenomenal. They are listening and updating all the time, small updates based on client feedback. Many things. Con: I don't think it's best for cash based.

I have a question regarding payroll. I started my cash pay LLC in April of this year with an LLC bank account for business expenses/income. I have yet to pay myself out as I'm somewhat lost on what the heck I'm doing.  I was going to save 30% of my income for tax expenses then transfer the rest to my personal bank account.  Would this be an ok thing to do? Or would you advise using a payroll software? If so, what kind do you like? 

I really appreciate everyone's input.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started my cash business 3 years ago and had the same questions.  My best advice is to find a good CPA and ask a lot of questions.  I recently got a new CPA whose goal is to decreased my tax bill as much as possible.  There are laws that differ in each state so a good CPA in your state will understand how to maximize your take home and avoid some pitfalls.

> **Response 2:** Hire a bookkeeper or accountant to calculate your taxes quarterly.  They'll tell you what percentage to save before paying yourself and show you where to send your local and federal checks to each quarter.  They can also file your business tax return for the year during tax season.

My question is regarding tax how to save money and claim expenses. Do I take salary from it to reduce tax or it does not matter. Total income from llc will be around 16-17k. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This has many answers depending on personal overall financial situation.  You should be listing expenses following the IRS schedule C. You should meet with accountant to identify your actual tax liability but start with reserving 30% of profit until you get that input. Quarterly estimated tax filings should be done. When earning less than $50_70k profit in a year most accountants do not recommend you being an employee and electing to file as a S corporation. Again an overall financial situation question

**Community Responses:**

Anyone here know what is up with TriEast? Per my credentialing person, they are still only accepting a few types of providers. He said I can become an "out of network provider" - but I would rather just do cash + superbill because, what is the point of being an "OON provider"?! Will my current Tricare patients not get reimbursed with their superbills?! Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s easy to be out of network provider then your patients turn in their own receipts and the prime people know they need a Referal regardless but that’s for them not fir you if you are in a direct access state.  Then as long as a Dr orders PT they usually can turn it in if going to an OON provider and get about 62-65% reimbursement.  Win for you both. (Just have the patient check with Tricare to see what is needed for their plan.  I just have to send in my updated PT license renewal to keep it going.  Tricare is the only one you actually have to sign up to be out of network provider everyone else, you just are.  Good luck!

> **Response 2:** Certain types of tricare will reimburse for OON services, but normally require for providers to be classified as out of network. There is a good chance that tricare will not reimburse based on a superbill. (My husband is a navy vet and when we had tricare we were not guaranteed reimbursement if we went out of network and they did not authorize it.)

I created a superbill for a patient recently. I went to her home to perform dance PT eval. I put the POS as 11 but insurance thought I was in network because of it. Should I have put 12 “Home” instead? I thought no because I wasn’t providing traditional home PT. I just provided concierge/mobile PT in her home. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That doesn’t make any sense. POS has nothing to do with being contracted or not. 

But to answer your question on POS it Really depends on payer and what they want. 

For the most part MedB is 12 for mobile and most commercial plans don’t recognize that and use 11 instead for OP services. They recognize 12 as home health instead.

> **Response 2:** If your NPI is/was linked to a previous in-network clinic that maybe what’s causing the issue. Insurance shenanigans. POS has nothing to do with it

Hey guys, had an OON question. If my cash rate is $200 and the patient’s deductible hasn’t been met, how do I explain that what goes towards the deductible is the insurance’s allowed amount (lets say $80) instead of the $200 they paid. Do patients ever get upset about this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I tell the patient to call the insurance company. The patient pays me, I provide superbill and tell them I have no idea what the insurance will reimburse. Never had any problem as I stay out of and clearly explain that I do not do more than provide them with the superbill

> **Response 2:** You’ll never know without collecting more data. 

If you only provide superbills you’ll never get the info. 

But more importantly if your cash rate is 200$ that also doesn’t provide any context to what you’re billing either

Hello, anyone here have experienced with Auto accident cases? How do we go about it? Patient called me last week and I told them I’m only cash. They asked me if I could wait for settlement, l said I don’t do that. What are you guys doing for auto accident cases?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you 😊 all!!

> **Response 2:** You make money by attorney liens in one of two ways:

1) you treat the patient. You bill each cpt code according to your fee schedule. The treatment is over. You send your billl. You wait until case settles and get paid. Off that payment you usually agree to a reduction with the firm. Ranges anywhere from 30-40%

2) you treat the patient. A middle man lien company can come in and you sell your lien to that company. Instead of waiting they pay you let’s say 30-35% of your bill straight up and they handle the lien.

Is anyone using Webpt for billing? We’ve been using them for EMR for over 12 years but use an outside billing company. Looking for reviews on how the service works and if you are happy with the billing aspect. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I switched to StrataPT - Physical Therapy EMR & Revenue Cycle Management. Billing is part of the EMR. They’ve been excellent

> **Response 2:** We used them and they were very bad. They do not go after any kind of complicated billing issue issue and will end up writing it off. If you go on the webPT support group on Facebook you will see that they did this to a lot of clinics. Every month they are claims that do not make it over to the insurances so you have to watch them like a hawk because they will just write them off. At one point we had an outside agency audit their work, and that agency called them “criminal “. Once you are done using their services they hand you a mess. I spent countless hours trying to get paid on some of it but somethings had to be written off because they let it go on timely or they messed it up so badly. I could go on and on about it, but it’s something that I think was our biggest mistake as a practice.

Had a client submit a superbill for out of network coverage through Cigna. Was told Dx code M54.5 LBP “is out of date or invalid” - any thoughts as to why? Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The diagnosis code M54.5 for low back pain (LBP) is considered out of date or invalid because it was replaced by a more specific code in the ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification) updates. As of October 1, 2021, the code M54.5 has been replaced with the following more specific codes:

- M54.50: Low back pain, unspecified
- M54.51: Vertebrogenic low back pain
- M54.59: Other low back pain

Cigna and other insurance companies require the use of the most current ICD-10-CM codes for claims processing. You will need to update the superbill with the appropriate new code for low back pain to ensure it is accepted. 

To determine the correct code:
- If the low back pain is unspecified, use **M54.50**.
- If the low back pain is vertebrogenic, use **M54.51**.
- For other specified types of low back pain, use **M54.59**.

> **Response 2:** In my previous employment (insurance based system) we were notified low back pain M54.50 usually wasn’t covered by insurances. Usually had to be more specific like radiculopathy (M54.16) or vertebrogenic (M54.51). But not sure how super billing reimbursement looks for it! Good luck with it!

Hi! I’m just getting started with my cash-pay business. I’m trying to understand what it means to be a nonparticipating vs out-of-network provider for insurances like BCBS, for example. Any insight? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m assuming participating means being credentialed in their system such as w9 and Npi on file, but not necessarily contracted/in-network.

Hi all! I was speaking to a local chiropractor (I am a physical therapist looking to launch my own business) she was telling me…

“she believes as a licensed healthcare provider you will need to register with CMS/Medicare in order to treat any patients.  That you can register as a Non-par provider and should be allowed to accept cash from a Medicare patients. Charges must “be in alignment with customary & reasonable for your region”.  I guess this has something to do with discrimination practices.  But I guess that’s the Medicare handcuffs, because Medicare patients are allowed to request reimbursement from Medicare and/or deduct medical expenses from their taxes which they are required to receive legit services from licensed practitioners blah, blah.  So bottom line, whether or not you bill/charge/submit to Medicare or not, you have to register with them as a non-par provider.” 

From what I can tell for physical therapist, the only way I could see a Medicare patient for cash if it’s truly a “wellness” session. But do I need to register as this “non-par provider”? I am in Illinois if that makes a difference!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi, Katherine Reinertson Wood thanks for asking this. I've been a Medicare provider (PT) for over 5 years, and this local chiropractor is a bit off base! Sounds like she is trying to explain to you what a Non-par provider is. Basically, you need to enroll with Medicare if you want to treat Medicare patients and submit claims. You can enroll as either participating or non-participating provider (confusing, right??!) Non-par does not mean you have no relationship with Medicare, you cannot accept cash (self-pay) from a Medicare patient as a Non-par provider. I would recommend checking out Tony Anthony Maritatos Facebook Group Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group. I've found it very helpful with navigating the Medicare maze 🙂 
You are correct, you can see Medicare patients as self-pay/ "cash" for wellness visits, if skilled PT is not necessary. No need to register with Medicare, par or non-par, to do wellness visits. Hope that helps!

> **Response 2:** There are 3 categories:
- affiliated with Medicare, Participating
- affiliated with Medicare, non-Participating
- no affiliation

If you are not affiliated you cannot treat anything that would be reimbursable under Medicare for PT. Non-medically necessary items (such as wellness), can be cash billed.

Hi Everyone!

I have a Medicare question. We have a 69 y.o who wants to submit his claim to his Medicare part C supplement which is through UHC. We are out of network with every insurance including Medicare. He seems to think he will get some good reimbursement from this. 

His appt was mainly for shockwave (which if I’m correct is a non-covered Medicare service) but some time was spent with exercise prescription. Any idea if this is ok to do? I don’t want to submit if it can open is up for an audit of any problems. I do have Jared’s Medicare book but that section says it’s a gray area so I’m a bit worried about taking the risk. 

Thanks in advance!

EDIT - ok update I’ve attached the cards provided (took me this long to get them). I hope this helps.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Part D is prescription

> **Response 2:** If he does have original Medicare + supplement you absolutely will not want to submit as:

1. Medicare offers no OON coverage nor will any supplemental plan since they just use medicares determination on whether they pay their 20% or not.
2. If you performed skilled PT, covered services to a Medicare beneficiary and charged cash it is technically not allowed. There is gray area. But if you go and submit a bill now you’re basically contradicting your determination of it being a non-covered service and opening yourself up to potential scrutiny (unlikely).

On the contrary if it is a Medicare advantage plan (part C) and you are OON and he has OON benefits let er rip. We get pretty good reimbursement this way daily.

I am only in network with Medicare. I'm not having luck getting pts to use me as an out of network provider. Is there a way to bill as an out of network provider without the pt dealing with it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes we are OON with several big insurance companies and bill them directly. It’s very easy through our EMR however it was a nightmare with some to initially set up

> **Response 2:** Some people have great out of network benefits and unfortunately those people that don’t have good out of nowhere Benefits yeah you won’t be able to work with them but also sometimes that might be a sales conversation process that you need to work on. There are plenty of people that can probably train you on how to have a better conversation when people ask “do you take my insurance“. Response should be well. It depends I would need to look at your insurance but before we get to that tell me a little bit about your problem and dig into the problem and then also show your value of what you do.

Hi everyone! I have a quick question regarding super bills. My patients insurance denied her superbill claim bc I didn’t include a modifier code with every procedure code. Can anyone help guide me here? This is my first superbill submission so I’m newer to this. 

Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am just here to say, I sincerely hope you have a different experience than I (my patients) have had with this process. I would say it’s more common to have denials / requests for additional info (all of which is already on the superbill), requests to resubmit etc., than it is to have a patient submit a self-Claim with a superbill and get their out of network benefit paid out. I wish it was different. That said, I am solo provider / owner and I have very little time to work through how to streamline this process. Good luck!  And I agree with the GP. I actually add that to all my claims and superbills no matter what since I only have PTs.

> **Response 2:** If you get in the habit of helping patients resubmit with all kinds of modifiers and you keep issuing them you are back in the habit from which you were running from. We do not issue a second one in my business. I tell them yep, that's why we don't work with them. Bc we will submit a 2nd time and it will be another issue...

Any South Carolina peeps here that are cash pay only who have successfully submitted a claims to BCBS? I’ve been trying to submit superbills on behalf of a client to BCBS of SC and I’m getting nowhere. I’ve probably spent 4 hours calling them and every time they tell me something different that’s either not helpful or seemingly incorrect.   If anyone has words of wisdom please let me know. 
I’m about to pull my hair out lol.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I basically had to become out of network with them so that anything could be process or submitted even if the patient was just a Medicare primary and Blue Cross supplement.

> **Response 2:** Probably the MOST difficult group for me to work with as OON: denied OON claims, checks mailed to patient (BCBS as a secondary to Medicare), etc.

Has anyone recently done a call with state Medicaid to get credentialed? They approved my business already(NPI2), but now want a call to credential me individually under my NPI. I’m kind of confused by this, but believe I have all the info I need to have a successfull call… Any tips from those who have experienced this? A lot is riding on this phone call.  (I’m a mobile Pediatric PT).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Just had the exact same thing happen and went through my audit Monday. It was stressful but I was prepared and the auditor was cool it took 30 minutes. Like the auditor said, it's an open book test, you can use your p&p manual to find the answers, you can Google, look up the Medicaid policies online. Whatever you need to do. Have your p&p, the Medicaid providers manual, and you'll be good.

Any feedback from those who have made the leap to B&M?

I’m at a place in my business (6 years as a mobile therapist) where I need to change it up. As I weigh the pros/cons with the transition to a B&M model one that stands out is the loss of work/life balance. I believe the long term outcome can be positive financially as well as impact on the community but at what cost? I’m currently experiencing paralysis by analysis 😂 but need to make some big decisions soon!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s really nice to have all the things in one place and not have to pack up and carry it to each house.  The overhead becomes a factor but you still run the show.  You can decide to see the same number of ppl with less profit or in a smaller window then try to rent it out later in the day or weekends to make up cost.  I liked the recommendation to hire a mobile provider then take b&m clients.

> **Response 2:** I started as mobile and opened a clinic 2 years ago. I am risk averse so I am subleasing from a prosthetic clinic so we can collab on his limb loss patients and I can see other patients there as well. Luckily rent is low and I haven't bought a ton of expensive equipment because the caseload hasn't grown as I hoped. BUT... every time I put the key in the door and see my business name on the wall, I am so happy so I'm going to keep it and work on growing that side of my business

I have been in business for 3 years or so... Things have gone well. I have one full time employee PT, a few very minimal contractors. I am constantly learning and trying to figure things out. Things aren't where I want them to be. I am doing my taxes and did some research on tax incentives, tax credits, deductions ect... I have a bookeeper but I do my own taxes. I am always worried I haven't documented and have the "paper trail" for everything in the eyes of the IRS. I know there are some tax credits and incentives I could capitalize on but I don't want to get in over my head. I am looking forward to strategize for the future. I have found a few companies with done for you programs but the price point is so high it seems more for an over mil revenue biz. I am not there yet. Does anyone have a biz that works with small biz owners to guide, assist and document this type of thing?

Hello friends! 
I am a new business owner and trying to find best accounting software. For those of you using Hello Note does the expense report in the system do a good job of exporting data from bank etc? I guess I’m looking for a well integrated software for my book keeping. Please help. 
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on what kind of business you are running, but WAVE has been pretty solid

> **Response 2:** For your business accounting software options are: WAVE (free), Quickbooks, or Xero. No patient names in these systems. Make sure you follow the expenses based on the IRS Schedule C as that is how you will need to have them listed for your taxes. It will also depend on long term your plans for bookkeeping and accounting as well. All of the above systems are recommended by accountants but some accountants do have a deal with Quickbooks that allows for a small price reduction and them being part of your set up.

I have a home health patient who is receiving HH PT and has opted to private pay for an outside PT so they can have more therapy visits per week. I know they cannot be charged out of pocket for services that would be covered by Medicare and that a PT cannot opt out of Medicare. Is this PT correct in accepting private pay for additional PT services since the patient is already receiving their Medicare entitled services from the HH agency?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes because additional services are not covered while under the Med A HH POC. 

If additional services were medically necessary then the other PT would have increased frequency.

> **Response 2:** Homehealth bills as Medicare A-
And the succeeding visits by the PT is probably part B ( in home outpatient)?
Anyone doing this? See a patient through Home health agency
Then when discharged, see the same pt as outpatient- home under Medicare Part B?

I am a PT with my own mobile outpatient PT business.  I also have a home health patient through SNAP Health here and there.  Recently I had a patient get screwed out of some visits by the home health agency due to their lack of communication with SNAP.  He had already been very limited by his insurance company in the number of visits he was given for home health.  

I had to dc him abruptly due to the home health company issues (This was Friday…he doesn’t even know yet.). Am I able to see him pro bono for a couple of visits through my own company to finalize his home program?  I feel terrible about how this has gone down, and he really does need therapy.  

I am reading about pro bono work, and it sounds like it’s not as easy as it seems like it should be.  I’m not a Medicare provider through my business and would not be charging this patient at all.  

This shouldn’t be a complicated matter, but as usual insurance and laws are jumbling it up on me.  Help!  Any advice here?

Another question 

I’m confused about Medicare. 

I know our individual NPI is ours forever. I’ve been asked for my NPI for the superbills I’ve given out. 

Should I enroll with Medicare? I know I can’t legally treat them for physical therapy cash based, but we CAN do wellness visits cash for Medicare patients. 

Is it worth it ? Some colleagues say no. Some say yes. Right now I don’t have any Medicare patients at my doorstep. 

But if I wanted to enroll, as a sole proprietorship do i still need a business NPI?  UPDATE. SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN ORGANIZATIONAL NPI.  FOR ANY WHO IS INTERESTED OR IN SAME POSITION AS ME.  YOU USE YOUR INDIVIDUAL NPI UNTIL YOURE READY FOR PLLC OR PC. 

I don’t understand the process.  

Idk if it matters but with my NPI under my old employer, I was fully credentialed with all insurances…….idk if giving my NPI on the superbill is going to affect that????

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I treat Medicare and it has been great. Really haven’t had any issues with billing and are a good payer in my opinion. I think it depends on who you are targeting and the people you want to work with. There is a large older adult population where I am in NJ and only got contracted with original Medicare. I use both my individual NPI and business NPI for submitting claims. Let me know if you have any other questions and if I can help in any other way.

> **Response 2:** You still should have a business NPI. 
I’m hybrid and find it easier to sell to Medicare clients. The reimbursement is less per visit than my cash based patients but it’s a nice stream of revenue. Plus I do transition quite a few of my Medicare clients to wellness. It’s give you an opportunity to get you foot in the door and they see how you operate. It’s an easier sell for wellness once they see what you are about and what you can do for them.

> **Response 1:** I would look at this the same way a client looks at getting free therapy on YouTube vs paying a $50 copay at the clinic vs paying $250 for a self pay home visit. 
…
Is there a difference? Maybe, maybe not. 
…
They might just be paying for the availability, access, and expertise, but it might be more than you need. 
…
It is an interesting opportunity to look at your own buying behavior and better understanding what your clients are thinking.

> **Response 2:** My taxes for personal and my LLC this past year were $520 in Wisconsin. My CPA was apart of a firm and they charge $200/hour. I learned that the CPA had someone prepare everything and he reviewed and finalized it which I was not informed about at first. I am looking for a new CPA who will do everything from start to finish.

I’m thinking about starting a vestibular mobile practice. I’d like to do cash only, but know many of the patients who need treatment would be likely be Medicare patients. I’ve heard that I can’t charge a Medicare patient my cash rate as I’d have to submit through Medicare. I could apply to become a Medicare provider, but when canalith repositioning is an untimed code, I fear it wouldn’t adequately pay for my time spent with the patient. Any advice? Thanks so much!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I typically use a lot of neuro re-ed for vestibular patients. 

One thing I wanted to throw out there is that yes you're going to get a lot of Medicare patients. Medicare pays decently. The problem is so many patients nowadays have the Medicare replacement plans and then you're going to have to deal with those. 
Rather than deal with all of the administrative BS, I wind up referring all of my insurance patients to Luna now and let them handle it. I get paid a bit less but it's so worth it because I can literally treat and not worry about anything else. Just throwing up that as a possible idea for you as well.
In my area I get 74 a visit if I refer to the platform.

> **Response 2:** You’ll end up charging eval plus CRM which is a good paying combo. When you do it as a follow up, you’ll use CRM only when the test is positive and then you’ll use NRE/ Self-care/tA/ TE for the rest of the session anyways

I don't want to offer PT anymore. Only wellness and coaching. How do I stop accepting medicare, BCBS and aetna? These are the three insurances I accept.

Edited to add: is it necessary that I terminate or can I just stop delivering services therefore no more billing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Looks like an "affidavit" has to be submitted to Medicare. I think I'm reach out to my MAC monday to get specifics. I hope getting out isn't as laborious as getting in. Medicare was easy, BCBS took over a year.

> **Response 2:** If you have a contract with them you need to terminate it. If it’s just out of network then you don’t have a contractual obligation.

Hey everyone,
I have an NPI and active Medicare enrollment (Part B) processed through my former employer. I’m now looking to start seeing patients and billing independently. I’m aware of the CMS forms needed to submit claims, but I’m stuck trying to verify my eligibility on NGSConnex. It’s not accepting my TIN. Does this mean I need to independently register my business with Medicare and obtain a new PTAN?
Any advice on what steps I need to take to ensure I’m set up properly?
Thanks in advance for your help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You need to actually register your business with a type 2 NPI through you Medicare credentials using PECOS.  I'm happy to help. I do several a week.

> **Response 2:** You need to register your Type 2 NPI, your clinic with Medicare. Then you tie your Type 1 to Type 2 by reassignment of benefits

How much reimbursement reduction do you guys see from Medicare ?

Medicare cut Therx  from $28 per unit to $21. This Probably seeing result of MPPR (multiple procedural payment reduction). It would explain the considerable drop in those values if you are within the same region.

Basically reimbursement is result of an equation. The equation is liability (small in PT), providers work (labor), and practice expenses (cost of clinic, equipment, etc).

MPPR is the reduction of the practice expense for coded units following initial unit, the argument being if using the same clinic why pay for it again.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Where the APTA at?

> **Response 2:** Confused by the MPPR? So if you bill therex twice you won’t get the full amount because you are billing it twice?

What or how are new/small business owners verifying eligibility? Feel like I get a run around or am on the phone for hours trying to get a representative.

How are you also learning about each insurance company's rule or policy to be an OON PROVIDER. Each time I call I feel like I get a different answer.

I'm new to owning my business so hiring someone isn't in the works right now but there has to be an easier way.

None of this is skilled services that it makes me sad. Also please don't say, take cash and superbill. That's not the route I'd like to take at the moment.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't do anything for out of network. I just charge the patient my full cash rate and then they can submit to their insurance company on their own.  They do everything

> **Response 2:** We call every single patients insurance and verify ourselves. Fortunately I have a receptionist now but it’s always me myself, my spouse that calls and does it. We use WebPT for EMR and looked into their eligibility verification but they don’t verify if you need authorization or not so we decided to not use it. I have yet to find a better way that gives us all the info we need. It’s so time consuming and we still receive inaccurate information ALL the time.

Hey all,

After looking through post after post regarding medicare part b, I have a few questions (I am sorry to beat a dead horse, I really tried to do my research before asking, but it's confusing!).. 😅

I am currently a mobile, cash-based PT in NY who specializes in neuro PT. I have been regularly seeing about 2-3 clients, 2 days a week, which is what works for me currently with my other job set up. I have had no relationship with medicare (not been seeing Medicare clients), but obviously with my specialty I think it could open up a lot more potential opportunities for me. 

1. For those who have a relationship with Medicare Part B, If I go that route, do you find that it makes more sense to be par or non-par in terms of ease of reimbursement, etc. ? I did find the resources on how to go about enrolling, but wanted to gain a little perspective from anyone who currently has a relationship with Medicare, particularly with reimbursement changes ahead in 2024.
1.  For those who participate in Medicare Part B and also accept cash for mobile services , do you limit your travel radius for your Medicare Part B patients to a smaller distance from home to compensate for lesser reimbursement compared to your cash fee?

Thank you so much in advance.. I know this is a topic that has been brought up many times!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sarah Viola would be a good one to chat with on par vs non par. She started non-par and is switching to par.

> **Response 2:** Definitely PAR is easier and the least hassle to manage.  I can help with credentialing if you want someone to do it for you. I have been operating a practice for over 7 years now.

Just starting my own practice. Currently waiting for the PLLC to be approved (in NY). Trying to get as much done in the meantime as possible. I'm sure I can't move forward with credentialing until I have the PLLC but as a startup does anyone have recommendations on a credentialing service vs doing it myself? Also wondering about a billing company and EMR. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It takes time to form PLLC (I did it too) compare to a PC. At this point I  would make sure you have your NPI and business NPI, try to register in PECOS system under your own NPI even if you don't have EIN number  for your business yet and proceed with PECOS Medicare  855B form to get the ball rolling if you plan to accept Medicare. I tried to pay someone to do credentialing for me and ended up doing a lot of it by myself.  It's expensive to pay someone and it can be very frustrating.  Most of the insurances have provider enrollment forms online and provider relations representative within a phone call reach. You can shoot me a PM with any questions, happy to help. In regards to an EMR, I personally use WebPT because it's very familiar to me and super easy, but Jane and HeNo have very pretty good reviews.

> **Response 2:** I hope you did an expedited process! The state is backlogged (estimate of 8-10 months) 😔

I am a solo practitioner practice currently utilizing a cash-pay model. The goal is to grow to multiple therapists and have multiple revenue streams with a 24/7 gym space and other holistic wellness offerings in the future. I do not want to go away from a largely based cash model because the liberty to actually practice our craft with fewer limitations has been amazing, but have recently felt a pull to contracting with Medicare and Medicaid to serve patients who may not be able to afford our services otherwise. I’m having a hard time leaving out whole populations of people who still need help. My question is, how tricky does it get when people have secondary coverage in addition to their Medicare or have Medicare replacement plans, as I would not be contracting with secondary or Medicare replacement insurance plans?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Secondary coverage (medigap plansO) are automatic and we don't individually credential with those to be paid. 

With being OON with MedAdvantage plans keep in mind that if the plan has OON benefits, and you submit a claim, you are limited to charging Medicare allowables. To truly keep things cash pay you cannot ever submit those claims, just continue with the route of cash pay + superbills. 

Also keep in mind that if you ever credential in the future, that standard commercial (such as RegenceBCBS) and MedAdv commercial (such as MedAdv RegenceBCBS) are typically credentialed together as they're administered by the same company.

> **Response 2:** Just communicate up front that you are not taking Medicare Advantage plans. They are ridiculous and I got screwed over several times, finally learned my lesson and started having the hard conversations. But, nearly 50% of those over 65 apparently have opted for those plans, so they would have to shift back to traditional Medicare then to access your services.

I’m curious how others go about providing PT to their therapists if needed. We’re a hybrid practice so for some of our therapists, we’re in-network with their insurance (that they have through a spouse). Curious if people charge, do a discounted rate, free or what?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We charge a discounted rate that the treating PT gets the full amount of instead of their normal commission. $60/hour session

> **Response 2:** We bill their insurance and write off any patient responsibility for 12 visits. Then 50% after that up to a certain amount. Spouse and immediate family included.

I know we, as PTs can’t technically “opt out” of Medicare— and the nuances with wellness. 

Can we opt out of Medicaid? (I’m in NC.) 
I’m specifically asking in relation to Peds PT, and providing cash-based “PT intensives” (2- 1hr sessions per day, for 3-5 days), which I assume would not be a covered service. 

There are PTs in NC that provide this stating that they are OON with all insurance and provide super bills) but I’m a rule follower and am hoping for some guidance. Is there a true answer to this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I remember from a private practice I was working for we did not accept Medicaid for years.  And then they decided to accept it and had to go through a full application process.   Many practices don’t accept Medicaid (NY)

> **Response 2:** Medicaid rules are state specific. I would check the guidelines for your state. Some states prohibit charging Medicaid patients cash while others allow it. I wouldn’t go off of people’s assumptions, thoughts or even their past experience with other clinics as I am also a rule follower.

Perhaps dumb question….Anybody offering mobile skilled maintenance therapy to clients, NON-medicare B, therefore private pay? Is this a thing??? How often do you follow? Reassess?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you mean skilled maintenance therapy to a non-Medicare beneficiary (ie a patient that doesn't have Medicare?)

> **Response 2:** Yes. I know off the top of my head that Regence covers it in my contact. I’d have to double check my other contacts. 

My follow-ups are dependent on patient, but typically 1 visit every couple weeks. I reassess every visit just by how I practice, to cover myself and know what’s going on for my people with more spaced out visits.

I told myself I wouldn't do insurance cause I wanted to be cash only but I see elders. So I am now a Medicare provider. No more insurance though...but now I have a referral source (only took a year but I got it!) but the majority of their patients have advantage plans and with so little business yet, it's hard to turn a patient down. Does anyone here have experience with Aetna Advantra Silver HMO? Curious if reimbursement rates are worth contracting with them for their HMO has no OON benefits and these patient's can't afford private pay. Not don't want to pay, they can't pay.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would ask Aetna directly. Being out of network with Aetna, I have had some clients where I have been reimbursed just about exactly according to the Medicare fee schedule.

> **Response 2:** Aetna fee schedule is typically 25-30% less than Medicare fee schedule per visit in my experience. Not worth it for me personally although I don’t know the specific plan.

Many advantage plan HMOs have a co-pay in the area of 25-30/ visit as well. Really quite awful plans overall for rehab purposes.

Also, icing on the cake, Aetna contracts are notoriously hard get due to capping number of providers per geographical region.

I'm starting up my solo practice. I had planned to go cash based but  I love working with the senior population so I'm looking to accept medicare.  I'm in the middle of getting credentialed and have an opportunity to add one more insurance e.g. bcbs, uhc, etc. For those who have experience do you have a recommendation for commercial insurance that provides the best reimbursement rate for out of network just in case I decide to include another? (I'm in Maryland if that helps). Thank you!

Hi!
An OT colleague has approached me about joining my mobile outpt practice, as a contractor. I used chatgpt for reimbursements in FL, and it seems as if medB pays ~$80 a session.

Can anyone confirm this or give me a closer amount? 

Also, what might the going rate for him be?

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That sounds pretty accurate for the Medicare reimbursement, but then there’s 20% more coming from the secondary. When I calculate pay, I use $100 a session for Medicare. Some visits  a little more, some a little less. It depends on what codes are billed. ￼

Would anyone be able to please guide me on how to submit a Medicare Advantage Aetna claim?   I am Medicare provider only.  

Aetna had me download a form called medicare provider complaint and appeal request.  I don’t know where I’m supposed to be putting the dates of service the codes I used and the amount billed.  The woman on the phone insisted that that was the right form and just told me to write it on a piece of paper and send it along with that form.  

Does this sound correct?

Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is the patient willing to pay you cash? If Aetna Advantage has OON, you can bill patient directly at Medicare allowance rate for the treatment then give the pt a superbill (cms 1500 form is the easiest) to submit to their insurance. Just don't check off the box to accept assignments

If you want to take on the plans and bill directly,  Availity is good to bill insurances. It took me a while to get set up on Availity though.

> **Response 2:** I personally don't accept assignment and do not bill the commercial advantage plans. I give the superbill to the patient and they submit. 

Each insurance company can have a slightly different process. You can do through a clearing house or use the CMS1500 form often times. Sometimes they'll make you ask for authorization as well if you bill directly.

Probably a better question for the Physical Therapy Billing group.

Regarding billing auto insurance... I've always billed following the 8 minute rule (53minutes an hour).  But I've heard from another clinic owner that auto insurance and a few other private insurances allow for 1 unit per 8 min, regardless of total treatment time?  Potentially 4 units could be charged in 32 minute treatment.  Anyone know if theres any truth to this?  Is there a resource I can review for clarification?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Auto and personal injury are not Medicare. They should use AMA guidelines, which means if you’re doing four different procedures each procedure could be as low as eight minutes and as much as 22 minutes. 
￼

> **Response 2:** They pay 200 percent medicare fee schedule we generally follow medicare guidelines for it but it's not medicare so probably you can bill it like any other commercial insurance but ull make a lot of money on it no matter how you bill we usually get 180 per visit for auto and 220 on the eval in Florida you can only do only about 18 visits though unless you bill less you could treat for more visits

So is that okay as for insurance billing goes??

**Community Responses:**

More often? Acl patients need 2-3 days/week early on. PTs who arent able to accommodate them are putting the patient at risk complications w scarring and more surgeries. This is the second post Ive seen this week that concerns me over care these patients are getting. Post op patients should be prioritized and given visits before non

**Original Post:**
I'm currently working in 2 roles: A clinic-based W2 job and my new, completely separate, mobile PT business. I had my first UHC client (mobile PT) and went through the pre-approval process to get visits authorized through Optum Physical Health. Well, it turns out that Optum's authorization for visits was based on one major incorrect assumption. Unfortunately, neither Optum nor myself confirmed the proper TIN was being authorized. Optum Physical Health based the authorization on the the W2 related TIN. In hind sight, it's my fault for not clarifying the proper TIN with Optum, but I'm new at this and don't know what I don't know. Well, it turns out that Optum Physical Health doesn't contract with mobile PTs. At this point, I fear that I'm just going to have to write off the claims (Medicare Advantage so no possibility for claw back). Does anybody have any advice on how to approach this situation? I certainly won't be accepting any UHC patients going forward. Thanks for any advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have had several UHC Medicare patients that I needed to get approval for before treating. But they still paid me.  They didn’t say anything about not paying mobile PT but I didn’t use that terminology, I just said this was for outpatient therapy, because it is, and they would also say “you’re out of network” and I would confirm, but they still paid me because I got pre auth prior to the visits. 
Perhaps the person you spoke to just didn’t know what they were talking about? (Happens a lot) because I’ve had several UHC patients and once I received the pre auth I always got paid.  
Granted getting the pre auth is sometimes a nightmare because I’d end up transferred several times but I always took down the reference numbers, and I always bill the first visit immediately and make sure I’m going to get paid before I schedule another one so I don’t run into an issue where I don’t get paid for any services

> **Response 2:** So your practice has no affiliation with Optum/UHC but you were through the pre-auth process?

Were you planning to bill OON?

I’m confused here.

Looking for any advice regarding billing companies.. I signed with a company who has not kept their word at all. I am receiving payments from my major insurances such as Medicaid and BCBS because they never helped me set up my ERA/EFT’s although it said they were supposed as stated in my contract. I stupidly sent them the deposits that were made into my account so now they could easily bill me the 7% they think they are owed. I’m just downright annoyed and angry. 

Is it worth getting a lawyer? Should I just fire them? I wish this wasn’t such a nightmare trying to do things on our own as clinicians.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I can give you advice.. went through some you definitely should not go with! 😬 What is your EMR and how many claims per month?

> **Response 2:** Is there a way to cancel the contract and start fresh on your own?  It's not the easiest to get done (requires a lot of follow through), but if you're already a PT you have learned and do way harder things in your everyday career.  You don't even need special training to credential yourself, just a matter of being organized and consistent.

I would like to propose contract OT services to a rather large grocery chain in NY. I used to work for this company and I know they value employee safety. I was hoping I could take on some sort of workplace injury prevention role in addition to providing upper extremity based therapy in hopes of preventing employees from having to undergo workers comp claims or further injury/surgery. I just have no idea where to start or how this would even work with dealing with insurance. Any guidance would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Lauren Hebert has an amazing program for ergonomics. Emma Shapiro also has a workshop for it. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** Need to find out if they are self insured or not.  That may determine if they can control where the patient goes vs a work comp network.  Also if you have “industrial medicine” clinics in your area they may already be using them.  The play is to do what you are proposing from a “corporate wellness” side.  Look for the Director of Safety usually in either HR or ops department and see if they are open to a meeting.  Pitch that you can address OSHA no -reportables better than the big clinics because you can be mobile and take the time to do workshops at each store

I hired someone who has dropped the ball and not able to help me with a credentialing issue with Medicare being a mobile therapist in 2 states PA and DE.

Hey everyone! 

Quick question about a super bill I put together for a patient. Cigna has not reimbursed him yet and told him it was because “the procedure code that was billed is not corresponding to the service that was rendered”. I went back and looked at the cpt codes and they’re all correct. Any idea of what they could be talking about? 

Thanks in advance!! 🙂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Also, ASH has taken over therapy services for Cigna. That could be the reason. They need to send into ASH instead of Cigna

I have a hybrid cash/Medicare mobile PT practice and have a unique Med B billing situation that’s a first for me. One of my Medicare clients just moved to an ALF Monday. I saw him Tuesday and changed his address, billed him at the new address.
The family is telling him it’ll be temporary for respite, but the son is predicting it’ll be a permanent change.
Either way, they are going to bring him back home for 2-3 nights each weekend.
I’m supposed to see him Saturday but he just informed me he’ll be back at his house. My question is, can I see him at either location and just keep switching the address? Or should I only see him at AF now that that’s his primary residence?
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t have advice on this but did want to say make sure the ALF/in house therapy doesn’t pick him up for HH services while you are seeing him

Hello everyone I asked question week ago about denial and seeing HHA as reason. That was a mistake. I went to NGS connex and the actual denial code is 040 which basically says price can’t go over allowed amount. But they’ve always just paid Medicare amount anyways. Then I saw someone else’s post about deductible. Any idea how much this deductible is and I wonder if that’s why it wasn’t covered? Maybe it covered their deductible and that’s why all rest of the codes from that visit were paid but eval code wasn’t. 
Same with other patient who’s eval in December was covered by first 2 visits of this year were not.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is why I ALWAYS hold my billing on patients that don’t have supplements that cover their Part B deductibles. It’s definitely a growing/learning process. It took me 3 years to put the puzzle pieces together in Januarys. Now I wait until they’ve been to the doctor/hospital/specialist and check to see if the aforementioned have sent their bills in. Once I know they have, then that other health provider is responsible for collecting the patient’s deductible. It’s a pain, but financially worth it in the end.

> **Response 2:** There is an annual deductible for Med B that resets each year. This year is $226 I believe. Many times the supplemental will pick it up. Sometimes not, which the patient would be responsible for. Some people will hold billing for January to allow for other outpatient services to occur in an effort to avoid this. In MA I’ve seen most supplementals pick up the deductible.

I feel like I should know this already, but I don’t and I don’t know where to look for answers, so im reaching out to this group. I’ve done HH for 10+ years. All insurance based. All my experience with documentation is based on keeping insurance companies and my employer satisfied and checking off all their boxes. Well now I’m starting my own self-pay mobile outpatient practice, and I just don’t know how much documentation is actually required. Do I need ICD-10 codes on every note? Do I need CPT codes (I assume I do if I’m giving the patient a superbill)? How long can I write a plan of care for? 4 weeks? 10 weeks? Are formal reassessments required, and if so, how often? I’ve tried looking up information in my state practice act, but it seems to only cover licensure requirements for the most part. I want to ensure I am fully compliant with my licensure while not over-documenting (which is what I feel I’ve done all these years in HH). Thanks for your input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in the same situation. Working for HH way too long now. HH charges Medicare A. Regulations are very different than outpatient services which bill Medicare part B. The paperwork in HH is becoming ridiculous. I’d like to learn what is required to begin an outpatient PT practice as well (because I have not worked in an outpatient setting for 16 years and I’m sure things have changed… ) especially to cover Medicare requirements to accept Medicare Part B. Where is a good place to start for someone opening a mobile practice these days?

> **Response 2:** Well my guess is that all the things you’ve been doing for 10 years were required so that you get re-imbursed. And if you get sued you need to CYA. So as far as documentation goes I would mimic what you have always done. To me the perks of f being self employed are in your freedom to pick and choose who you serve, when and where you work. If you give super bills and your clients can’t be reimbursed because of shoddy documentation then it could come back to bite you. You have to decide what type of reputation you want. If repeat business or referrals are not a concern then you can do what you want.

Anyone has any experience seeing a teenager (17yo) longish term?
I’ve had kids with developmental delay in the caseload for years, but that is different.
He is 17, diagnosed with scoliosis and lyme. The scoliosis is currently an uphill battle because he is still growing, so not making much improvement but not worsening. But the main thing is that due to the postural issues abs lyme issues he gets muscle spasms, cramps and pain. He has allergy to tons of stuff so no pain medication (though not sure mom would want a 17yo to depend on pain medication). 
I’ve been seeing him since September last year now. We’ve got to a point where things were good enough we were down to every other week, but back to once a week. Any more than that he locks into spasms, pain holds back from doing activities, etc.
I am out of network with his insurance (tricare select), who has been paying all along without a single concern)… but I’ve been getting nervous lately that while I know we are holding curve from worsening, and releasing spasms so that he can do activities etc, if tricare was to ever request my notes, there would be no “net gain”….  More like maintaining… I keep getting worried I will suddenly get a letter asking me to return all payments or who knows…. 
Suggestions? Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My son sounds similar. Severe scoliosis. He is 26 yrs old. Severely disabled. He has PT once a week all year long. If we don't, he wakes up "stuck". I'm a biller, not a PT so I don't have the right terminology but his legs are "scissored" and stuck. Lots of pain. I haven't had problems with insurance paying, but as a Mom, I'm not worried. I'm kinda a Momma Bear when it comes to my son. They wouldn't win. Most of my "Mama Bear" friends are in the same boat. He's not regressing, preventing pain, requires skill, I can't see them denying. For the sake of the kiddo, please don't stop. 🙏😉

> **Response 2:** At 17 he isn’t skeletally mature. Can you document height and weight and then the changes in height and weight? Or get measurements from mom from early treatment to now? Then you can justify by saying that growth affects his scoliosis and progress. Often times insurance does not take into account a child’s growth and they should!  I went through something similar with my son and bracing and fought it like this and it worked.

Has anyone had any luck becoming an OON provider with BCBS Tx. I've spent hours googling and trying to call, but I haven't gotten anywhere. TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What information are you looking for?
Being OON just implies you don’t have a relationship with them. Technically every business not contracted with BCBC is an OON provider.

> **Response 2:** I’m in PA, so I don’t know how similar the process is… also, my situation was Medicare advantage BCBS… but it took me 4 months!
I’m new to this, so maybe I wasn’t asking the right questions.  But, it seemed every rep I talked to had a different suggestion.
I sent in my first claim via paper and attached my W9… that did not work.
Eventually, I talked to a knowledgeable rep who showed me the forms I needed to fill out on their website.
It was an exhausting process!!!

Help!
I recieved an email from one of my employees and it said her name on from: and 1st email asked "I need to change my direct deposit and how do I do it". 
I replied back saying to do it directly though quickbooks (that is what I use for Payroll). 
Then I got a second email screen shot below. So, I went ahead and changed it in QB. I have not processed the payroll this week- but I got the some intuition to text the employee and tell her I have changed her direct deposit to which she said she had never sent me the above 2 emails. 

I am not sure whom I can report this to? Kind of scared of this scam- if it is coming from the employees mail box or mine or from QB.

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you and please be on a look out for these kind of scams.

Has anyone decided to go with an HSA tied to a mutual fund with catastrophic care coverage vs. standard insurance for themselves and their employees?  Thinking pros vs. cons on something like this.  To be honest I’ve heard this could be a fiscally smart long term option but I don’t even know where to begin.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have maxed out contributions to a HSA for years. Significant tax advantages (pre-tax contributions, tax free withdrawal, tax free capital gains -- all assuming these fund qualified medical expenses). I also leave it fully invested in S&P500 Index Funds (as opposed to higher cost mutual funds) and covered put options on S&P500 ETFs. It's about as hands off as it gets for passive management while avoiding ridiculous fees. One could argue (myself included) that a ROTH IRA should be fully funded prior to an HSA. Important to remember that if one can afford to pay for medical expenses currently out of pocket that you can "reimburse" yourself at any point down the road!

> **Response 2:** Max out both roth and hsa if possible. Tax advantages are huge for later in life. If you are nervous about a catastrophic medical bill, you can always keep the equivalent of your deductible in the hsa non-invested. The math in most scenarios usually favors the hsa plan vs a quality plan IF you contribute to the hsa account.

**Making the switch from in-house to medical billing service**

Hi Everyone, I am looking to switch from in-house to a medical billing service. Can anyone share if you've made this switch, and how happy you are with the results? I have a call scheduled with Clinical Billing Solutions who partners with our EMR, Practice Perfect. I'm starting there, but I'm sure there are other billing companies. We are  a very small clinic and have suddenly lost our in house biller (who also covers some hours at the front desk). Trying to find a solution that is sustainable and affordable. Thank you!

Recently got a referral with pt Medicare and Medicaid. 
I am par with Medicare but never worked with Medicaid. How does it work with Medicaid being secondary insurance? ￼

Do I need to apply for approval or something? Will the claims forward to them after Medicare processes them?

Any guidance is highly appreciated 🙏

Happy Holidays 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. The claims will be automatically forwarded if you have set up correctly in your emr. But if you are not in network with medicaid you may not get paid. Also you can not collect that 20% from pt.

> **Response 2:** As a general rule, Medicare will take care of the secondary...like if it's UHC secondary, you don't have to be in network with UHC to get the 20% that Medicare doesn't cover. I am only credentialed with Medicare and I still get paid by my patients' secondary. I don't take Medicare/Medicaid bc in NJ, Medicaid won't cover the extra 20%

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I looked into this where I work. In idaho it is written in the law that you can charge interest at a certain rate (after 30 days if you submitted a clean claim within 30 days)  but you have to check your contract. The one insurance I wanted to go ahead and try it, they sneak a clause in the contract that you waive that right.

> **Response 2:** A secondary insurance paid me with interest once because it was so delayed. I wasn’t even expecting that. It was a BCBS secondary plan (Medicare was the primary)

Hey guys! I could use some help. I live in Maryland, and as a PTA, I just opened my own practice. While  waiting for credentialing to go through, my PT and I have been working as independent contractors through my friends business so we could get the ball rolling. I was denied by Medicare after applying myself, so I decided to pay someone to do the credentialing for me. I was told that i will not be able to credential with the insurances under my own company as it will need to be done through the supervising PT (there isn't anywhere on the Medicare application where we can put the supervising PT info). Can anyone shed more light on this situation and possibly provide references?! Thanks in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am a PTA that owns a clinic. Feel Betterpt is correct the PT has to reassign their NPI to your clinic which is the type 2 npi then you credential the PT with Medicare and that will credential the clinic

> **Response 2:** PTA do not get credentialed with Medicare and most other insurances.  You are practicing and billing under supervising PT NPI. As such there is nothing to do for you.  

You will have to get the contracts credentialed through that PT.

I have my first patient! 🙌🏼😬
The patient contacted me to inquire about services; they have Medicare + a secondary insurance so we’re good there. 
I think I have my ducks somewhat in a row on the business side (llc, Medicare approval, liability insurance). I know I need to get my intake forms together and my EMR ready to roll, working on that now. Does someone mind if I give them a quick call to just go over what your process is for getting the actual physician referral stuff taken care of, and to make sure there’s nothing I’m missing before I jump in to this? 
Or does someone have a resource that they can point me toward?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** With Medicare you are just required to have a signed POC. So you'd want to know the Dr, but no real requirements except getting that POC signed.

What Heidi said. With everything else Medicare, it’s super helpful to take Anthony Maritato’s course if you haven’t signed up yet.

Other than those, I think you’re all set. Best of luck!

**Community Responses:**

I refunded the amount that Medicare paid me back, but not the entire amount that they paid me. Was that the correct course of action? ￼￼

> **Response 2:** Option 2 would be a non-covered service that the patient pays for and does not want to try to file with insurance. 
Option 3 would be if you offer a non-covered service and the patient declines.

Ok, confused 🫤 
I have a young patient who has commercial insurance through his parents and Medicaid. I see this patient on a cash basis. The last treatment session his parents casually brought up the patient now has Medicare Part A. So my question is, since I’m strictly cash based and don’t file Medicare, do I release him as a patient? Or since he is only receiving Medicare part A am I still in the clear to see him as an outpatient? 
Such a slippery slope and I’m not trying try to play games with Medicare 😑

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can’t charge a Medicare pt if you are a provider. If you are not you have no problems. In addition medicare part A only covers inpatient.

> **Response 2:** The Medicare A issue isn't a problem bc med A doesn't cover your services. I think it's also important to know that if it were any issues, then it's a matter of the patient's parent giving incorrect info on their intake paperwork and you'd adjust once you were made aware. You can't really be at fault when the info you need to be compliance was withheld from you. Make sure they know they'd be billed if lack of info caused you to be denied for services, but since you charge cash that's not an issue for you.

I have been doing a cash-based concierge practice, and one of my clients asked me if she can submit our appointment to her HSA. Does this mean I need to provide her with a super bill? Can someone direct me to a post or information about how to make a super bill?￼ I know it’s been talked about a lot in here, but I feel a little lost on how to correctly make one! Thank you so much in advance!￼

Hello all! I know it's a busy weekend for the #Uncaged team, but I was looking for some advice. 

I am considering adding a brick & mortar location to my mobile practice. 

What are some of the main things from the insurance and business side I need to make sure I have before taking that step. 

(I would be renting space from an already established business -not a gym) 

Thanks for any insight

Hi guys, 

  Is it okay to use your personal laptop for work? Or do I need to get a new laptop that is separate for work?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on how you're able to accommodate HIPAA guidelines and the standards of whatever insurances you work with.  A separate laptop isn't strictly necessary, but it may be easier to make a separate, protected account on your existing device for work.  This has two benefits: added protection against patient data loss/theft, and helping literally keeping your work and home life separate

silly question, I am in the process of starting my own LLC
I currently have my EIN, NPI and business account created.  I will be a cash based and oon business.
I am now looking into using EMR and bookkeeping
From a financial perspective, is PTE or Jane good enough for both EMR and cash flow management/ bookkeeping or should I also invest in Quickbooks or something similar as well?
Does it depend on who your CPA is/ their preference or does that not matter?
thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You may want too look at wave bookkeeping

> **Response 2:** Same situation as you. Janeapp makes it easy to track all card transactions. Not as great when a patient uses cash or a check.

I asked my CPA if I needed quickbooks. She asked if I was proficient with excel, which I am. So she said quickbooks was not necessary at all. So, I have created some excel spreadsheets that help me track everything. But that was a decision between myself and my CPA.

Starting up a cash practice on the side of my full time work soon. Do you suggest meeting with a financial advisor right away, or is using a separate business checking account and keeping track of expenses enough for now? Looking for some input from others with experience!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** My first year I completed tax forms on TurboTax, but did not submit. Instead, I waited to see what my CPAs results were. He got me $6k more in refund. 

As for a financial planner, I wouldn’t go there yet. My cousin is a successful financial planner. He and I chat and he continues to say I’m already doing all the right things. I have read books like Profit First, Richest Man in Babylon, Rich Dad Poor Dad, Creating Wealth, etc. and apply that info. Later though, I will need a financial planner - but not yet. 

Hope that helps!

This question may have been asked before but I'll just ask again. I just had a phone call from a patient's family member who wants me to treat his mother who is about to be discharging from a SNF. The family member does not want to use her Medicare insurance due to it not being able to cover PT and lymphedema (don't know how true that is) and wants to do a private pay. Can I move forward on seeing this patient or should I turn it down? I want to make sure legally I'm not doing anything wrong by possibly accepting this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You'll need to bill Medicare. I'm not sure why she thinks it isn't covered. It is.

Hello everyone,
I’m a new practice owner and have a quick question. A patient recently contacted me after being involved in a car accident. Pt has a claim number from her auto insurance, which is already using for chiropractic care, and now she would like to start physical therapy with me. Pt  plans to submit the claims to her auto insurance.

For those of you with experience in these situations, how do you typically handle such cases? Any guidance or best practices would be greatly appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Whoever submits first, gets paid first. If you end up seeing them on a lien, then you won't get paid until it is settled. That can take time....I've seen it take a few months to years for payment to be distributed. You'll want to have a contract with the attorney in place. fyi...some attorneys will come back at a later date and try to negotiate payment to a lower amount.

> **Response 2:** Call the auto insurance, speak to the person handling your patients case. Find out if the PIP policy (personal injury policy) is exhausted or if there’s still money in it. Typically it is $10,000 and they pay out claims as they come in. So what Heidi Grove Harmon said is correct. Submit your billing immediately. 
They will not tell you how much is left in the policy, so have your patient call and find out. Once that money is gone, if you choose to continue treating them, it will be on a lien with the lawyer so you will have to contact them￼

I need to give my 4 week notice asap. I have no room). 2 evals next week
Concern: my caseload is 40% Medicare. Which can take 4-6w to pay plus secondary even more.
How do I calculate how much $$ I need to have saved to maintain cash flow until Medicare pays? so far I’ve been using hh as cash flow until Medicare pays.
I get the whole saving 3mo expense but can’t maintain both for long enough to save that much, unless I cut some people. Only so many available hrs.
Thanks

If you’re providing Wellness services, then yes you can continue. But if you’re providing medically necessary physical therapy, you should be billing Medicare to begin with, not doing cash pay.

**Community Responses:**

With the topic of Medicare and cash prices, so if I’m an owner of a private practice in Texas who only provides cash services, am I simply not allowed to take a Medicare patient who is willing to pay my cash prices?

If not, why?

**Community Responses:**

But the short version of the story is we aren’t supposed to accept cash pay for medically necessary and skilled services from Medicare beneficiaries.

> **Response 2:** Lots of discussion about this in the search bar. I have a hybrid private practice in North Dallas. If you have Medicare B pt in need of skilled PT, send them over to me! I’ll get them well and send them back to you for wellness.

I am a LMT and CLT. I provide lipedema care. I do not accept insurance; I'm cash based. A client is trying to get her insurance to reimburse her for my services. I received a letter from BCBS saying that I am not on file with them and they provided a link to their credentialing page. As a LMT, I'm not familiar with what this means. Do I need to go through the process so the cleint can be reimbursed? I have zero intention of billing insurance directly.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Many insurances require you to be "credentialed" in order for the be willing to accept any documentation from you, whether it be a super bill or CMS 1500.

Credentialing is not usually the same thing as "contracted" or in-network.  With credentialing, the usually want a W-9 and your information to simply list you in their system.  No contract needed.

They might not accept the superbill if they require you to be credentialed.

> **Response 2:** It is possible to be Credentialed as an OON provider. If you complete any credentialing, then you want to ensure that you are not being asked to enter into a contract with them and their contracted rate. More often than not, an insurance can process the superbill provided to the patient with a copy if your W-9 to verify your business information.

Hey guys I’m quite frustrated and need some help. Tried figuring this out on my own with no luck. All of my patients have been medicare for most part and I bill through office ally no issues. I got affiliated with BCBS recently and saw 2 TKR starting early April ended few weeks ago. I got my provider central PIN and activated it for BCBS website etc then submitted claims through my office ally. I don’t see the claims on my provider central and have gotten nothing back as far as payment or communication from BCBS. 
I’m sure I’m doing something (or a lot of things) wrong on my end. For those of you who bill BCBS do any of you use office ally and if so is the process any different from Medicare patients? 
If not do any of you just submit claims through provider central? If so if you don’t mind DMing me very basic steps to do so I would really appreciate it. 
Sorry guys I’ve tried calling BCBS but am on hold for over an hour without luck. My office ally says claims went through and didn’t kick any back. Thanks again everyone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve had some that didn’t go through at first electronically but did when I submitted by mail. Then after i was able to start submitting electronically. Just a thought. I included a w9 with the first claims as well.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go to each insurance companies website and do it on their websites. Look for sign up as a provider. You'll also want a business an S Corp or something and NPI 2 and a separate banking account. It's also good to have a proper Google email that's for your business

PROS & CONS?
I have an ALF that really wants me to be the go to MedB provider for them.  I know the residents well, and enjoy going in.  Most I would assume have Medicaid as supplement to Medicare, if not as primary.
I have not wanted to participate with Medicaid at this time, however, I do see it as an opportunity to work with this ALF and serve those residents.
If I saw these patients who have Medicare primary with Medicaid secondary, do I HAVE to see Medicaid patients at my clinic and mobile visits elsewhere?
Since I wouldn't be travelling much, more patients can be seen in a shorter time, is the difference in what Medicaid doesn't pay out worth it?
Any pros?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Used to do exactly this before starting my own business. 

It can be really profitable. Need to be sure to do due diligence in making sure (frequently) that home health is not seeing a patient. Otherwise, it’s similar to seeing Medicare patients in a bricks and mortar. Back to back scheduling, opportunity to screen and enroll more patients, etc.

> **Response 2:** Something to keep in mind is that many ALFs are a private pay type of living situation.  Medicaid is based on financial need.
So chances are, if they have enough money to live in an ALF, they probably don't qualify for Medicaid.

If it's not a true ALF, but more of a state funded group home, then yes, those residents probably have both Medicare and Medicaid.

Officially hired on my first contractor for my mobile practice 🥳I bill OON. I am already credentialed with all the insurance companies; do I need to add the new therapist on and credential her or does it all fall under the company? Any help would be great. TY!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For OON, it should be based off your tax id#

> **Response 2:** #Compliance perspective - verify w/each plan. Most states have Insurance Fraud Laws, including Florida. I am aware of this being implemented involving a non-credentialed therapist billing under credentialed therapist - so verify how your company would bill, based on your credentialed status, for a "contracted" employee.  A lot of pieces to consider.

Haven't removed this in months since I received it in the mail, thanks David Bayliff, I am trying to connect with anyone in this group regarding how to verify patients insurance, I work for a company who has a team that verifies a patients insurance and gives me what is their deductible, out of pocket cost.  I am credentialed for Medicare patients, question is how do I go about billing Medicare, if theres any videos someone can send a hyperlink to or if someone can pencil me in their busy schedule just answer all my newbie questions, I would greatly appreciate it.  I am trying to finally get this ball rolling since I have started my PLLC, I'm really tired of my job as a overworked DOR and really committed to finally transition to working for myself, I just need some help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You will need to register for a CA EDD employer account for payroll taxes, apply for a Workers Compensation policy (mine is through State Fund), and an accounting program to process payroll (I use Quickbooks). Your employee should fill out a W4 form that you will need for payroll and income taxes.

> **Response 2:** We use Gusto which manages payroll but also handles a lot of the hiring paperwork for us and submits everything to the state and federal that it needs to. In California, they absolutely have to be an employee, not a contractor. That’s the main thing about our state. That and the requirements for sick pay that’s like 40 hours of paid leave per year now.

**Community Responses:**

Hello all! Does anyone have experience working with someone who has BCBS primary, and Medicare secondary? I am mobile and primarily OON/cash pay, but am participating in Medicare Part B. This is a process I'm finding online, and looking for clarification and confirmation of understanding.

From what I'm seeing, I would try to submit the claim to BCBS (or have the patient submit the claim?) for OON benefits. BCBS would likely pay nothing, and then send back an EOB stating as much. This EOB could then be submitted to Medicare, for usual reimbursement (0% until deductible, 80% after). The patient would then be responsible for the remainder (20%). 

Does this sound accurate? Or are there other components I need to be aware of?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Med part b will pay 80% and then bcbs will do the 20%. 

I'm non-par and all of the claims I've submitted this far have been automatically forwarded to the secondary.

My experience is that bcbs will only issue the payment to the patient for OON claims.  For that reason,  we keep a card on file so that way once the claim processes and if bcbs has paid the patient we can still get paid. All of our patients have sent the money directly to us,  but I know that some therapists have had to eat the cost of the 20% because the patient refused to send the money that bcbs sent them.

> **Response 2:** I used to do billing, yes that sounds about right. 

Sometimes the payment and EOB goes to patient so make sure you have in written form and signed by patient that it is their responsibility to provide that to you, or they would be liable.

I have a patient with Medicare who wants to be seen 5x a week. They are happy to pay for the additional sessions as wellness. I just have a few questions about this.
1. Can we do 2x per week through medicare and 3x per week as wellness?
2. What paperwork do we need to see them with wellness?
3. What is your recommendation for payment methods? I’m assuming credit card would be best, how do you set it up?
4. How does documentation work with all this?

Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I treat a guy privately for cash with mobile PT who goes to outpatient PT 2x/week. 
My services would not be covered by Medicare so I see no issues with it.

I would say just document well on what you’re doing differently to separate these sessions and you’ll have a sound argument if ever needed (highly unlikely)

> **Response 2:** You can't just call extra sessions "wellness" because they're not covered by insurance. If you're doing PT (and read your practice act about PT vs wellness) then document it like PT. Because it's not medically necessary per medicare, you have then sign an ABN and collect cash. Now if you're doing "wellness stuff" in compliance with your practice act those other 3 days, then yeah. Document wellness visits and collect cash. Still probably need an ABN.

Practice owners- If I hired a PT/PTA as a 1099 to see patients in my practice, does my practice have to credential them with insurance companies especially Medicare to bill these patients or do they credential themselves with the patients’ insurances to bill them even though they are my practice patients? 
How does this work and what are the other ways to hire a therapist to see my practice patients on a temporary basis to cover in my absence? Do not wish to pursue W-2 route. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Im not sure in the legality behind it but couldnt you just co sign the notes? You are credentialed and are name billing.

> **Response 2:** Pretty sure the answer is yes. If a therapist is going to be submitting claims through your tax ID, they need to be registered with you. That’s what i did for my 1099

Hi there,
Wondering if anyone has experience offering lymphedema therapies, such as wrapping, and whether you take insurance? I am wondering if it's worth taking a certification course in lymphedema treatment. Not many people offer it in my area, and I am wondering if that is because reimbursement rates are low and the therapy can be relatively labor-intensive? Anecdotally I have seen a considerable need in my community so I would like to provide this service, but since it would require a few thousand dollars of investment, would like to hear about others' experiences. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We do, hybrid practice

> **Response 2:** Hello there! I have a practice for lymphedema across the board. I also have a hybrid business model where I take a combination of medicare and cash pay patients. We also have ongoing maintenance care memberships which shape our wellness programs. I'm unsure what your community needs as far as an insurance based business model or cash based but we always need passionate and caring lymphedema therapists in every region. I think if you take insurance you really have to dive into what you are billing and how you're building it when it comes to lymphedema. Supplies are also an issue and you have to decide how you're going to get your patients supplies in a cost-effective way. And sometimes lymphedema is not very glamorous especially when it comes to wound care and lower extremities. However, you are 100% correct! The need is great and with the certification you'll have the skill to really provide relief and hope for a diagnosis that in most arenas appears to be hopeless.  Where are you located?

Hey guys! I'm in the process of getting my cash-based mobile PT business started and am trying to figure out the legality of treating clients as cash pay who have Medicare as their primary insurance. I've read from numerous sources that it is illegal to treat as cash pay when they could potentially get Medicare to cover their services, even if the services we provide are medically necessary. I've also seen or heard of others who do accept clients with Medicare insurance, but inform them that they will not get reimbursed and/or put in writing something along the lines of the clients declining to receive PT services under their Medicare insurance. Is there some way to word on intake forms that would allow cash pay businesses to see Medicare clients or is it illegal in every way?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unfortunately PT cannot opt out of Medicare, so if it is a medically necessary covered service by Medicare, you cannot charge cash for it. If it is something not covered by Medicare, you can charge cash for it. That is why a lot of us have a “wellness” component to our businesses, to offer more than is covered by Medicare. This can include, any service provided outside of the home (gym, park, grocery store), needing help cleaning up their home, HEP compliance when PT is no longer necessary, coaching/training, etc. Chapter 15 of CMS is a great resource to start diving into.

> **Response 2:** PTs cannot legally opt out of Medicare. 
Any medically necessary service requires a Medicare claim to be filed.

Anyone who does a lot of conversion to wellness services have a template of a disclaimer to use on a "switching to wellness" form? I think it just might be a good idea working with medicare patients to have something stating they agree with switching to wellness when no longer medically necessary to continue PT. Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything; I have "you know you're switching to wellness" "you know medicare/insurance doesn't cover this" "you agree to pay cash" etc. and then have them sign it. Not missing anything in general?

**Community Responses:**

Hello I'm looking for some assistance getting up and running billing Medicare part b. 

Already have my own entity NPI 2 and bank account. Just looking for some assistance getting credentialing billing and CAQH sorted out so that I can start seeing and billing.  I would prefer to find a service that I can outsource this too so I can primarily focus on patient care rather than these logistics.

Thanks for the assistance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Over the last few years with helping over a hundred therapists do this we have learned a lot. One thing I recommend is learning to do your own credentialing! And learning￼ to do your billing!! Once you get going then you can transition to having someone else help.

> **Response 2:** I sent you a dm

Hi all! Anyone have recommendations for financial advisors or resources willing to advise on student loans?

Before opening my biz I was at a non-profit and 4 years into a PSLF plan (it was the major mental hurdle to jumping ship and doing my own thing). Between that and COVID, I’ve been on this IDR plan making minimal payments for a while.

Now I’m 3+ years into business and I’ve tripled my previous salary but haven’t quite figured out the approach to the loans. Still technically on an IDR plan and paying the minimum which would theoretically be forgiven in 12 years.

I usually pay my debt aggresively (or dont carry it)but also understand basic math and see that I’d pay FAR less over the life of the loan if I were to keep paying the minimum another 12 years vs aggressively paying down over 200K in debt with $ I could invest into scaling my biz.

Our financial advisor doesn’t understand the world of loans and doesn’t trust the government to forgive so he has been minimally helpful and the loan servicers/government are useless on this.    

If anyone can speak to this or has a recommended resource please let me know or DM me!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If your non profit service was specifically to get your loans forgiven that is reasonable. But otherwise, you took out loans, you should pay them back. If you have an IDF plan and you 3x your income, you need to recalculate that payment anyway. This a more personal matter but if you take out loans, you should be the one to pay them back, not the tax payer. Obviously I don't know all you situation but you did ask facebook so here's my 2c. Congrats on going out on a limb and succeeding with your business!

> **Response 2:** Following. Had a few planners look at my debt vs income and % of return if I were to invest in the market. Given the % rates of my loans and volatility of the market, even playing it safe, the advisors ultimately concluded it maybe a wash and best advised to pay off as quick as possible, versus carrying debt.  But am all ears for others input.

For those of you doing the "Profit first" method of paying yourself, what percentages are you using? I'm seeing some differing opinions on percentages. For example: 
5% Profit, 50% Owners pay, 15% Taxes, 30% Operating expenses  
VS 
15% Profit, 25% Owners Pay, 30% Taxes, 30% Operating Expenses

How do you decide what your percentages should be??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Haha such a personal question! Depends on your goals. If you don’t want to ever sell your company the profit margin is less important. If you plan on selling down the road, you’ll want a larger profit margin. You’ll also have to look at what your financial goals are and how your business model will fulfill them. It takes time to tinker with the numbers to find what is right for you.

> **Response 2:** I’d consult with a CPA on this, especially for the taxes portion 👍

Questions for those in Denver, CO: does anyone know if it’s necessary to open a Sales Tax Withholding Account through the CO Dept of Revenue if you don’t plan to have retail sales? As I understand it, providing physical therapy services is tax exempt, so in my mind it would be unneccessary. However, I just want to make sure I’m not missing a step in the set up process. Also, same question applies for local sales tax. Thanks for your help!

Hello fellow therapists,

I just completed a telehealth consultation with a client who has dementia and is currently located in Edgewater Park, NJ.

I’m looking to connect with a high-level private practice that provides in-home Medicare Part B services. This client needs PT, OT, and SLP, and the expectation is truly skilled, evidence-based care—not just routine exercises, but thoughtful, intentional therapy that makes a real impact.

Their insurance is Medicare/Aetna.

If you know a clinician or practice that takes pride in delivering high-quality, patient-centered therapy, please reach out or tag them below. 

I want to make sure this patient gets the level of care they truly deserve.

Thank you in advance for your help and collaboration.

Anyone here want to chime in on their experience with PIP insurance in their clinics? 

I have a chiropractor friend who swears it's some of the most reliable and lucrative clients she gets. But I had heard from another owner years ago that it was a bad idea.

I'd love some real-life feedback from people who either love it or who have been burned by it. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are billing auto insurance PIP policy, it is a first come first serve sort of billing situation! Get your invoices in fast before the PIP is exhausted. Once it is exhausted, you will likely be waiting for payment through an attorney settlement and as Heidi said, this can take years sometimes. Ultimately they are lucrative, but you have to be able to have the cash flow to wait for a few years. We always have a handful of cases like these, but I certainly wouldn’t build my whole caseload around it. 

Always reach out and talk to the adjuster at the insurance company and the lawyer as well. Make sure they understand that you are treating and expecting payment based on settlement of the case ￼￼

> **Response 2:** It can be very good or very bad. Typically you will wait for a settlement for years. But, I always demand full pmnt (no adjustments) when we have to wait. In clinics we'd take them but only a few at a time.

How would this work? 
I have an opportunity to take over ownership and operational management of a small (60ish visits/week) PT private practice from a combined Chiropractic/PT business. I want to keep two of the insurance contracts (Tricare/VA) associated to the original NPI but will ultimately run the entire business with my business NPI, etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It will be based off tax id#. You will have new? Or will that remain?

> **Response 2:** So I just recently bought my existing clinic from my previous bosses. I had to fill out a form to take over possession of the existing tax ID to maintain my credentialing. So I think an easy thing to do would be to set up a DBA and continue to use the old tax ID just for those insurances. Depending on where you are at least. For me, it was impossible to get back on with Tricare and BCBS otherwise. I’m in the Florida panhandle and neither are taking new providers. As far as the VA goes, if you’re already credentialed with Optum, then we were told all you have to do is let them know you want to be credentialed with the VA and they’ll put you on.

Each insurance, including Medicare, has rules to follow to get paid.

Hello!
Does anyone have any insight on how to bill insurance when services were rendered by a PTA? 

I use PT Everywhere EMR and when the PTA sends it over for signature and I sign it does not have the PTAs name (has my name instead) on the CMS1500 form. To me this makes it appear that I performed the treatment rather than the PTA.

If anyone has been billing for PTAs service and can help I would so greatly appreciate it!

**Community Responses:**

Hello everyone,

Any suggestions on EMR system for mobile PT? I am not sure if this help but will be doing a hybrid of insurance and cash pay.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We are hybrid, been using HelloNote since 2018

> **Response 2:** I just finished doing  a bunch of research on this specificity between hello note and Jane. Ultimately I am choosing Hello note due to pricing, Medicare friendly and good services. Everyone raves about Jane’s customer service but the draw back is that their pricing for the middle plan which everyone should do if you are billing insurance has a separate clearing house fee and fee per claim. So with Jane it’s $99 plus $25 for the clearing house and then .30 cents per claim. Hello note is $95 which includes the billing of Medicare and their clearing house and no % is given up with billing insurance. Hello note also per reviews has Medicare reminders on PN and other Medicare friendly tools. So it depends on what you are gearing towards. Also hello note has fax option included in the $95 a month so you can fax out the Medicare notes to doctors.

Has anyone had issues with UnitedHealth Group Medicare Advantage paying claims then denying them a year later and taking the money they claim is an overpayment, from other patients reimbursements? We were audited and didn't have the time codes (a technicality where a box wasn't checked so the time didn't print on the claim), the problem was fixed, claims were amended with time codes now showing on claims. They continue to take money back for 3 months of treatment of two patients totally thousands of dollars! I can't get them to speak to me or return my calls! I've left several messages for the PT auditor, for supervisors and no one will help me. We are a small family owned practice. I spoke to an attorney who said this may be class action case. This has to be illegal and is definitely unethical! We are considering no longer accepting UHC Medicare advantage patients. Has anyone experienced similar issues with UHC and Optum?

**Community Responses:**

Medicare - definitely can see them at home. It’s still outpatient, just with a home location code instead of clinic location code. 

Rough numbers in Oregon for 1-on-1 hour treatment sessions and utilizing RTM, it took me about 68 visits in the month to hit the 10k/month reimbursement mark. I started taking insurance about 6 months ago myself.

Question on keeping track of money:
Hey, I started my biz in 2023 so as I am closing out last year's finances, I am trying to figure out how to do the bookkeeping. I am Mobile PT, Cash/Medicare only at this time. 

With Medicare payments:
1) If I put the claims for DOS from 2023 in Dec 2023, so receiving payments this month and 2nd insurance also paying me in 2024, how do I track the income? 
- do I say I got paid in the 2023 accounts or put the $ in the 2024 accounts (on my excel sheet)? 
Example: DOS for IE is 11/14/23, claim approved 12/5/23 - Medicare paid 12/5 their portion, but 2nd insurance check came in 1/9/24

2nd example: DOS for follow up visits in Nov/Dec, submitted claims in Dec, payment received in 2024 

I hope I am making sense, lol. I just want to keep track of my income/paid claims for yearly tracking therefore need to make a system that can be easy to carry forward.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not a tax professional and this isn’t advice but the cash accounting method is much simpler method than the accrual method. Basically the cash method of accounting is just “money in, money out” so you don’t have to worry about matching accounts receivable like in the accrual method.

> **Response 2:** My understanding (not a tax professional) is that the year that you receive payment is the year it would be counted as income-no matter when the claims were submitted. So if part of the payment was received in 2023 it would be applied towards the 2023 tax year. Likewise if a portion was received 2024 it would go to 2024 tax year. Wouldn’t hurt to discuss with a CPA .

CPT code question!

Possible new patient wants me to do a home eval. Colorado offers $5000 in tax credits for making homes safer and more accessible. To be eligible you need a qualified medical or social work professional to verify medical necessity. They want me to be that professional. I've done many home modification evals through the Colorado Medicaid waiver program as a home health PT, but this'll be a first as a mobile part B provider.

Question. How would you bill this? Just 97161 or is there another code specific to home mod/safety like there is for wheelchair assessments.

Follow up. Does traditional Medicare reimburse for home mod evals, or do I need to issue ABN and use GA modifier?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Might be a better question for Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group

> **Response 2:** Sue Doyle would be who to ask

Good Morning! 
I have a question! 
If my company are in network with insurance companies for example bule cross blue shield, and they created an ID for me, as they bill through the provider's name. 
Now, I'm openning my own practice and not sure what should I do to get in network with those insurance companies as a provider and as a company ? 
Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just went through this: you need to register your company to be in network and then fill out a change form to essentially reassign your NPI and name to your business

> **Response 2:** You will need to get credentialed with your own clinic. I handle billing and credentialing. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.

Made a mistake of picking up someone who said they had Medicare coverage (I checked Eligibility on Ability and it went through). Turned out they have United Dual Complete & Simply Healthcare for secondary. I looked it up and United Dual Complete is for those with Medicare & Medicaid. I am assuming this is OON for me. Has anyone have experience with this? Am I able to bill OON? Good thing I have only done the eval and would probably have to pause treatment until more verification.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I actually just had this same thing happen. I called to check eligibility and it was your typical Medicare picks up 80% and Medicaid would pick up the rest if you have a contract with them. We don’t contract with Medicaid so patient was responsible for the 20%.

> **Response 2:** When I bill these, the primary will pay Medicare rates but you will have to let the other 20% go if it’s Medicaid and you’re not credentialed with Medicaid. Cannot bill the patient the 20%

(Ex: I submitted an 855I today, 7/26/23, however I would have liked the effective date to be earlier this month - 7/6/23). I spoke with Medicare and they told me that as soon as I receive a determination letter from them (which will show an effective date of 7/26/23), I will be able to submit an appeal for an earlier effective date, however they did not explain the steps of how to complete that appeal. Any info would be appreciated - thank you!

Does anyone do their own billing (not through an EMR or billing company)? I'm just starting out, learned the basics of billing Medicare with a CMS 1500. But if I wanted to bill OON for a Medicare Advantage PPO, is it basically the same process? Send in a CMS 1500, or submit it online if possible?

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Certification #Compliance 

Certification is applicable to therapists that enroll as a Rehab Agency (OPT) or a CORF (Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility.

What is the reason for your question? Did you perhaps "accidentally" complete the enrollment for Part A (Rehab Agency?)

I just finished reading CashPT, got to the section on Medicare and it really confused me. If someone is paying cash how can Medicare stick their nose into the situation? If anyone has info for Indiana laws that’d be helpful. 

Just getting started, at the research and planning phase

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Medicare has a mandatory claims submission rule for physical therapists, OT, and SLP. We cannot opt out as can physicians, etc. 

This doesn’t mean you can’t bill cash. If services are medically necessary then you should probably bill Medicare. If it’s wellness, fitness, training or the patient wants accountability for a HEP, etc that’s fair game

> **Response 2:** Yet there are people out there charging folks with Medicare cash for medically necessary care. And lawyers willing to charge you $1000+ to assist with this process. I'll never understand it.

Question: 
I have a client who has met all functional goals & was able to perform their training they were preparing for—I progressed them to the point where they were able to perform combatives and carry a holster without reported back pain. His insurance authorized 6 more PT sessions despite me stating in my note that all functional goals have been met. We had the discussion that it may not be medically necessary as he was able to achieve his goals. He then responds with “but I do have pain when I sit…” ..this was after he ran to my clinic and stated feeling “more stable”. 

I’m conflicted. I don’t believe it’s medically necessary and feel that it’s unethical to see him at this point despite insurance approving him for more and am concerned he is coming in for a “workout “ which is clearly not covered by insurance. 

Help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Maybe shift your focus.  Performing activities pain free maybe a new goal. 
Ask the patient why he thinks PT is  still beneficial.  
Small steps toward progress is still progress. 
Look at the whole person.  He sees value is the services provided… insurance sees value… why?

> **Response 2:** Insurance can always go back and audit the notes and if they deemed you provided services that are not skilled they can ask you for the money back. Billing insurance without medical need is also considered abuse . If your patient needs treat him but many patients think about PT as a work out as you mentioned already.

Happy Friday everyone! 
Question about if anybody has experienced this: 

I am 6 months into running my cash based solo practice. I have an office space in town and am not set up to bill insurance nor have I contracted with insurance under my NPI Type 2/my LLC; however I am contracted for all insurances with my OP staff PT job in the next town over for which I still work 2 days per week (I'm in NM). I must have somehow gotten into the system for my personal LLC and have started receiving referrals (Medicare included) from local doctors. This is awesome; however, I have had to contact those offices to let them know I am currently fee for service cash based and am not billing insurance through my personal office location. 

Has anyone deal with this? It sucks to turn patients away, but it is what it is!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would say get credentialed with Medicare.  Open up your base. On the other check to see if they have OON benefits and then if not offer cash pay options

> **Response 2:** Agree with Sue Doyle here. No reason not to credential with Medicare. The 100ish/visit you could get is likely far more than you make at your OP job and this population may help you escape employment faster (assuming that is something you want)

Lots of potential to build relationships and transition to wellness/cash based care. Also you never know who might be that one patient you see that refers you 10+ of your ideal clients.

Question:
There’s a Medicare pt who just started home health part A with a company.
She has lymphedema and she wants me to wrap/manage her legs at the same time (I have cert in Lymph Mgt). The HH therapist is not lymp certified so he can’t do that part.
Can I do session with that pt for lymph out of pocket with an ABN? If yes, what would be my reason for out of pocket pay & not utiize medicare? 
I would think lympedema is medically necessary.
I would appreciate the input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** following because this is where the patients needs are medically necessary and the insurance/HH is hindering healing and progress.

> **Response 2:** If you are totally out of network with Medicare, I am very comfortable with patient signing stating they understand the services you are providing are not and cannot be covered by Medicare. I know that makes some people queasy, but that's my approach. Now, if you are seeing some other Medicare beneficiaries and billing Medicare, that gets iffy really quick, in my opinion.

**Original Post:**
If you’re in-network with Medicare, do you also have to be in-network with the secondary insurance (like UHC, Aetna, or Medicaid) in order to get reimbursed for the 20% coinsurance?

Also—how does it work when the secondary is Medicaid?
Do they pay the 20% coinsurance if you’re not enrolled with them?

For those of you who are out-of-network with commercial plans:
Have you had any success negotiating with Data iSight (Cigna/Aetna’s repricing vendor)?
I’m increasingly getting underpaid—often well below FAIR Health—and every time I try to dispute or appeal, it ends up in a loop between the payer and Data iSight, and eventually gets denied.

Would appreciate any tips, success stories, or appeal strategies. 🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No you just need to be in network with Medicare

> **Response 2:** Some states laws dont allow you to collect the 20% from Medicaid insurances. Check your state law.

Other insurances will be automatically sent the20% if Medicare has it on file. I get checks about 2-3 weeks after Medicare pays.

Just noticed this when in the midst of filing:

BOI e-Filing Alert:  Please note that beneficial ownership information reporting requirements have been affected by a recent federal court order. The Department of the Treasury is appealing that order. In the meantime, reporting companies are not currently required to file a BOIR and are not subject to liability if they fail to do so while the applicable order remains in force.
However, reporting companies may still opt to file a BOIR.

Looking to start my own mobile hybrid insurance/cash-based practice. I have so much to learn so I love reading all the discussions. Been a PT for 12 years now and currently doing PRN and part-time work at different insurance-based clinics. My biggest questions right now are: 
If I already have my individual NPI number, do I need another NPI (NPI 2)? 
Do I need to do another CAQH?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Kevin! Hope you’ve been well. You’d need an NPI 2 for your business entity. For example, with Medicare you would do an initial enrollment with your type 2 NPI and you’d reassign benefits to the company for your type 1 NPI (assuming you have been credentialed with Medicare under your type 1 while working for other companies). 

As for the CAQH, you’d likely need a similar process. Create a CAQH for your practice and then affiliate your personal CAQH with your practice profile

For those cash pay but participating with Medicare:
Since you're not contracted with any secondary insurance the patient might have, what happens if a patient's trying to push their deductible or anything else they might owe onto a secondary insurance? Do you just give them a super bill, do you just have them pay it and they can submit their receipt to their other insurance, or do they just pay their deductible with you and that's just not something they can use their secondary for?
I apologize if this is a dumb question, I've been in a hospital clinic for the last several years and they don't really make me have to understand very much Medicare stuff, because there's always somebody who will fix it

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The supplemental won't pay the deductible unless it's Plan F. That plan was discontinued years ago but some were grandfathered in. I'd be collecting up front.

> **Response 2:** They don’t submit to their secondary. Medicare will automatically cross it over to their secondary and most will pay you even though you are not in network.

How do I go about billing auto insurance? A patient reached out but I have never done that before.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Patrick Toy has the best information for this.

> **Response 2:** Pretty easy you need the name of the insurance company all state geico etc the claim number and just payient demos.  Call the insurance company get there mailing address and mail in the claims with the notes as well you have to send both.  There lawyer will reach out later for the notes and claims via email later on.  Everyone is out of network with auto so it pays really well usually 170 or so per visit so worth the extra work. Here in florida the pip is up to 2500 but check that to see if its exhausted usually the lawyer will know.  If it is exhausted u can bill there insurance or do ur cash rate and have them sign something called an lop.  Once they case settles you will get paid if the lop is signed the money the patient owes out of pocket.  The auto company pays u if the pip is not exhausted and like i said around 170 or so for 4 units

Having troubke finding this answer, so wanted to ask here.  I know Medicare mandates re-eval every 10 visits, but for other insurances in Florida is there something in the practice act that dictates how often re-evals must be done?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Friendly correction: Medicare requires a Progress Report every 10 treatment days.  Medicare never has required a re-evaluation - and in fact has specific guidance on re-eval, and cautions..

Hey guys have a quick question. I am mostly Med B provider. Have had 2 patients in the last month referred from their VNA after discharge. I saw them for initial assessment same week as their discharge and am coming across some rejectioned claims that don’t make sense. Patient 1. I got paid for full eval visit all cpt codes then next 2 visits just got denied stating “Alert: This payment is being made conditionally. An HHA episode of care notice has been file”. Same thing happened with patient 2. But only for their eval cpt code. All other treatment cpt codes for initial visit were paid…. Any idea what’s going on?
I called NGS who said looks like HHA is in I told them they aren’t and they told me to check NGS connex. No idea where to look on there. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have had to call the HH agency to remind them to discharge the patient in the system. Also, get the discharge paperwork for your files in case they say it was an open home health case.

Hi guys, do you guys see better outcomes being OON with BCBS than IN-network? I’ve DM’d several people about this but I have  potential clients who have BCBS (TX). I hear you have to fill out a form to be ”OON” with BCBS for your clients to even receive reimbursement? Debating whether to be in-network vs OON. I’m currently cash-based only and still figuring it all out.  Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Also depends on the goals for your practice. If you go in network, your rate will be significantly lower. However, you get more volume because people want to use their benefits. There are pros and cons to both

> **Response 2:** Depends on your state I believe as most bcbs are run locally. I never had to do a form with Florida blue and never had any issues. They were the easiest to work with.

Hello! I run a cash pay PT clinic, and I recently got a check from an insurance company. It looks like reimbursement for the patient. I'm wondering if any of you brilliant people know what I should be doing with the check? Should I sign it? Should the patient sign it? Any help is very appreciated! Thank you in advance :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It's a pain in the butt but you have to send it back. Tell the patient it was sent to you and they need to call their insurance to get a new check issued to them. I have tried signing it over to patients (didn't work) and also cashing it then writing a check to the patient. This just leads to MORE checks coming to you! Keep it off your books. Send it back. Fix this problem now before it snowballs (trust me on this!)

> **Response 2:** Did you bill the insurance?  I guess no since you are cash pay. I would call the insurance and tell them. Keep it off of your books

I finally got my business medicare credentialed, so I know a lot of patients have a secondary insurance that would sometimes pay for their medicare deductible and cover the 20% leftover, do I have to undergo the same process to get credentialed for other insurances like BCBS, Optum, Aetna, Humana?   Also my target population is geriatric patients.  Anyone else in the same boat or went through same experience would appreciate any feedback.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Regular Medicare.. I believe answer is no - Medicare will automatically submit to Supplemental 
- advantage plans are a whole different story

> **Response 2:** You do not need to be credentialed with each secondary. Medicare will automatically forward the claim to the secondary once they have processed it.

How often do you all meet with your accountant? I bought my brick and mortar last year and feel like there’s very minimal input from our current cpa. As a new business, shouldn’t that be happening quite a bit? I’ve called and messaged him and get very little response se. I’ve only met with him once, and feel like I’m on the back burner. My husband has a business and it’s who he uses (they’ve been friends for years), but I just don’t think I’m getting what I need. Thoughts?

I hate this but at this point I am considering a zero tolerance behavioral policy for patients to sign upon entering a PT/patient relationship. Does anyone have one for their clinic they can share? I recently had a mom name calling over a bill, didn't think she should have to pay her portion of her sons bill and I'm just done responding to people who are verbally abusive towards me as a provider over their insurance policy and other insurance based rules.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a clause in my service agreement that is along the lines of "you'll retreat everybody with respect." ￼It basically says that if you treat anyone less than pleasantly, that includes other clients and therapists, I reserve the right to fire you as a client. ￼I had the lawyer add it when he was drafting my agreement.￼ I enforce it with zero tolerance.

Hello! I have a patient that switched to Medicare Primary last year. However for a variety of reasons she has kept her regular primary BCBS PPO plan. She ALSO has a separate BCBS supplemental plan just for your FYI. 

She is very complex and I have seen her off and on for the past two years. At the start of this year I saw her under Medicare. She was making slow steady progress but I was starting to get worried the progress would be not be significant enough to pass a Medicare audit. So I switched her over to her BCBS plan which I had billed the year before. 

I recently received a larger reversal of payment from BCBS. When I called they said I need to complete an EOMB (explanation of medicare benefits) and the patient needs to update her COB (coordination of benefits). The BCBS representative was very unhelpful in explaining what any of this means, how to submit, or what to include on the submission. 

Sooooo.... all of that being said, should I work on jumping through these hoops (and if so, any advice you have on how would be appreciated) OR should I submit these claims to Medicare, knowing with hindsight that she did continue to progress throughout the POC. 

Thank you for your thoughts and advice. Cross posting to try to get as much help as possible. 

Picture of a dog on a scooter in Paris for the algorithm.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Might get an answer in Learn Medicare Billing for PT, OT, SLP or Physical Therapy Billing 

I would start by looking up her Medicare benefits in your MAC portal to see how they have insurance listed.

> **Response 2:** Call your MAC and ask them what this means. I have found my MAC staff so much more helpful. Just an fyi patients don’t need to have progress to receive therapy she may qualify for a maintenance therapy program which is a covered Medicare service-not sure why you stopped billing Medicare?

At what time of the phone call do you ask patient what insurance they have or if they have insurance?

I have 2 insurances I used to take and can’t get them to get me out of network no matter how much I try (call, email, mail, fax…) they just won’t  acknowledge receipt to start counting time. I am very careful not to accept patients from these insurances, and to refer them to other providers. One of these insurances has very few providers in network, and I will often get calls from their representative asking if I am taking new patients and trying to schedule their patients. Also they don’t identify themselves: hey this is Ana with XYZ insurance. Usually when I ask: who I am talking to, they just say: Ana. 

Anyway, someone calls and say: hey I want to schedule a session, when is your next opening?
When is the appropriate time to ask: do you have insurance?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s one of the first things I’d ask.

“Sure have you ever been here before?”

“No, okay no problem which insurance carrier do you? 

Answer the question fast don’t waster your or their time. 

Also send a certified letter stating you want to be dropped from the network. Key thing here is certified mail. If that doesn’t work report them to the state regulator.

> **Response 2:** Similar to others above I ask right off, but I usually start with are you using insurance or cash, and then follow up with the which insurance question.

Workers comp or MVA in home PT?
Since all of us Med B therapists are receiving a nice paycut in 2025, I am thinking of ways to offer this. One thought was workers comp or MVA because i heard they pay well. Not even sure if either of these are options for in home treatment. I’m in NJ. Does any be have insight on this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In my experiences MVA in NJ is capped at $105/ visit. So not making much more with a Med B patient in that market. 

Workers comp I believe pays more, some companies contract so you’ll need to be in their network(I think). 

Otherwise just have to contact the case worker and see if you’d be approved to treat the case. 

I have seen both instances in home so that is not a barrier.

> **Response 2:** Seems like it’s not worth it as a solo PT with one per diem. Too much headache

Are there any companies or networks that allow a small business to bill under their insurance contracts?  If not, how do we start this?

**Community Responses:**

Question for those of you who have worked with/billed Aetna insurances.

I’m having a hard time looking up the benefits on availity.  It’s asking me for a payer provided ID number, which I don’t have since I’m out of network with them.  

If the plan is an Aetna PPO plan, have you guys needed pre auth to bill that insurance?  

Also, do you know if it’s Aetna better health Medicare/medicaid dual do I have to have a Medicaid number or is just have a Medicare PTAN ok?  

Any insight from anyone who has worked with these insurances before would be appreciated!  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Call provider/member services on the back of their card. Availity doesn’t always give you all info

If you don’t have a contract with Medicaid the patient will be responsible for whatever Aetna doesn’t cover.

> **Response 2:** You can call their credentialing department and tell them you want to register as an OON provider.  You’ll have to fax them a W9 and some other info.  I got the  payor ID number to use in Availity on the first call.

Does anyone have experience treating  someone with VA insurance (not Tricare). I have a patient requesting my services but we don’t have a contract with them. I’m not sure if we can see them and what the process would be.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you don't get VA authorization to treat the patient, even if in network, you will not get paid. If there are VA providers nearby, then they will more than likely send the patient there. If not, the VA may be willing to pay without you being in a contract with them, butthis is rare and you'll still need authorization.

> **Response 2:** VA can be pretty specific to location. We’ve had them deny before but then we’ve also had them approve due to being a closer location.

I did a quick search, and it seems like the most recent post was a year back. 
So just posing this to the group again for more recent input. What EMR do you use? What do you like about it? I'm easing into mobile practice with a very small patient volume. I don't want too much up front overhead, however, I want to have a good setup if I want to rapidly expand in the next two years.

Do your systems integrate with scheduling and other day-to-day business needs? Or do you have a patchwork set up?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Insurance or cash?

> **Response 2:** I utilize Prompt. I know it is expensive but I run a small practice (me and a part time PTA). Billing was new to me. I take only 4 insurance plans. The integrated nature of billing with Prompt has made it easy for me to take on this task. I now have someone who helps me a few hours a week and she said out of the systems she’s helped with, she is most impressed with their billing integration. I did not want to have to deal with switching EMR so I was looking at the long term benefits

**Original Post:**
I have a question for those of you who do take insurance for outpatient PT.

What is the average time it takes to get eval and/or visit authorization back for those insurances that require it?  I realize it depends on the insurance and promptness of physicians, but I’m just trying to get a general idea.  

I work PRN in pediatric home health, and on average this process takes 3 weeks minimum; in some cases 6-8 weeks.  

(Working on a post for my outpatient business page and don’t want to give inaccurate info)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on insurance. 
Majority of ours are within a few days as long it’s within their visit limit per calendar year.

> **Response 2:** I’m a pedi PT who also came from HH.  I do all insurance stuff/billing myself now.  It can be done using a portal called Availity in like 15 mins. Now, I only take BCBS, so it’s easy least with them, so others may be different. I’m in process of being credentialed with Medicaid and that may be different- not sure.  Happy to chat if you want

Mobile therapists & additional insured... 
Another condo building I'm treating in is asking to show proof of insurance & to be added to additional insured... so now I have 5 places listed under additional insured (2 gyms/3 condos). Is this the norm? Is there something I can say to the condo's that may help me not have to add them.  I have insurance to follow me as a therapist but assuming its to cover their gym... 
I know $10 isn't a big deal but curious if this is necessary (I use myPTinsurance/Acord)
Thanks for any insights :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you required to submit a certificate of insurance for temporary work that you will be doing in their gym or building.  Or are you only going in to see a patient in their condo?

> **Response 2:** Just $10?? Our additional insureds are $330 per and we have 16 of them.

**Community Responses:**

Blue cross blue shield does not cover part B services in the home in Florida. Aetna you have to get credentialed and I keep getting denied as they say they have enough therapists in my area. I’ve heard Aetna is not worth being credentialed with anyway as they require pre-approval and usually only approve a few visits

Suggestions / opinions PLEASE :
   I have started mobile PT( CASH  based ,primary focus being NEURO) I am in NC . I have only 1 patient . Many enquire, ask the rates & no call back . Also I see here discussions abt how much paper work and how low the Medicare reimbursement are nowadays 
My question ; Based on ur experiences, 
 1) should I stay Cash based or 
2) Should I enroll to accept Medicare , is so as Par or Non Par …
All suggestions are welcome . Thank you all!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a fully mobile neuro practice in Austin TX. We've expanded to 3 part-time PTs plus myself full-time, and 1 part-time OT . We do about 75/25 split Medicare and cash . Some of the Medicare patients stay on and pay cash for wellness. The more we've grown the more cash patients we've actually done. Taking Medicare and Medicare Advantage has definitely been worth it. It pays out about 70-75% of our cash rate for regular visits. Medicare pays evals about the same as our cash rate.

> **Response 2:** I would imagine neuro a big Medicare age need but it’s not my area of focus so maybe I’m wrong. Connect with others in the same niche.

3 short term and 3 long term goals are pretty standard in my experience, but is there a specific number of goals required by any insurance companies?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No but I think Medicare and by default most insurances only requires long term goals

> **Response 2:** From my experience, insurance seems to be very concerned about goals being functional. I’ve had authorization denied because of this before. Thankfully, the insurance reviewer told me why the authorization was denied and allowed me to make my goals functional.

Question what liability insurance policy would you recommend.

I currently work full time home health PT as a W2. I will be working on my own business side of thing and will be the only employee for this year during my side business.

Should I get an individual or company liability policy.! I was told to get the company policy because it covers the company and myself in whatever setting I work. Though I feel like if I get an individual policy it would be sufficient enough since I’ll be the only employee. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If your employer has good insurance and CM&F has a cheaper insurance option for part time coverage.

Hi all! I have a client who wants to receive services through me (I’m private pay only); however, they have managed Medicare (BCBS as primary, Medicare secondary). I am not credentialed with Medicare in my private practice. Is this off limits? Or can I provide treatment? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So let's look at terms here. If they have managed Medicare e.g. a Medicare Part C Advantage plan they no longer have original Medicare at all. If a spouse or the beneficiary is still working they could potentially have BCBS primary and Medicare secondary. Medicare Advantage plans can offer OON benefits which do require that you bill them, generally that is if they are a PPO plan. HMO plans generally have no OON benefits and you can charge cash.

> **Response 2:** I was under the impression you could not charge cash for anyone who was Medicare eligible, even if they don't have Medicare?

Question on authorizations for OON providers. Is it accurate that many patients can't submit a super bill for reimbursement if their plan requires auth even for OON providers? If so, do you check their plans for them? How do you handle this obstacle for your patients wanting to use their OON benefits?

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This just happened to me - I received a call from a insurance saying the patient needed prior authorization.  I have patients sign a consent stating it is their responsibility to find out what their plan requires and they are responsible for payment no matter what.

I just opened a cash-based PT clinic and I have no relationship with Medicare. I am having a difficult time discerning which circumstances warrant “wellness” treatment that can be provided to with clients with Medicare. How do you all go about the Medicare situation? Can you give examples?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** I saw a patient for "wellness" after she was discharged from a PT clinic. She was an active golfer and pickleball player. The clinic said she reached her goals/max potential, but I continued to work with her under "wellness" so she was comfortable playing pickleball and golf again.

Had someone reach out with VA benefits inquiring how that works with OON cash pay services and I honestly have no clue if it works the same as other commercial insurances or if there are more rules around it. Would love if someone could give me a brief run down. And does anyone have an idea of how well (or poorly) they reimburse? *cross posting*

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** VA doesn't offer OON benefits. You have to be a provider in their network and also have authorization prior to treating to be eligible for payment. The patient can pay cash to see you, but won't be reimbursed.

> **Response 2:** Va goes in network only at least for outpatient through va community care through optum basically united health care so if you have a contract with optum u can get the va community care.  Preauthorization is required so until they have an auth number generated in their system you cant treat them.  It does pay well though 90 plus for 4 units outpatient

Hi! I’m new here! So many questions as I’m getting started! Please bare with me 🤣

For those of you who bill insurance and are mobile.. 

How do you validate billing outpatient therapy services at home and billing with the modifier (12- home) rather than billing for home health services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can also bill code 11. It’s arguably your “office” because you bring the clinic to them. Code 12 works but sometimes insurances don’t understand that it’s distinct from HH

> **Response 2:** Hello. FYI 12 is the place of service and not a modifier. Per CMS guidelines in home therapy in eligible for billing under Med B services. BCBS usually follows Medicare standards as I understand it. I can’t speak for other insurers because those are the only two I deal with.

My question is, is there any way I can see this patient before I set up my WebPT account? if yes, then how? any suggestions or ideas are welcome. TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Of course.  Just document in Google Drive after signing the BAA and submit an electronic claim on availity. You don't need to submit a paper claim

> **Response 2:** You can document on paper and submit a paper claim to BCBS. It will take longer then submitting it electronically. My EMR in Janeapp was functional almost immediately for something like this though and I could have signed up and worked the kinks out later.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If it is a situation where the parent pays up front, gets a superbill and then gets reimbursed, sounds good to me. I wouldn't want to be waiting for payment.

Hi everyone, Medicare question 👎
A patient that we are seeing only wants to come once/month…. Many reasons why. Anyways I guess the question is if we go to a maintenance program, out of pocket, what are the stipulations? Is it not providing care that can be billed to Medicare? If so, what does that entail then?
I want to help the patient, but at the same time I can’t bill Medicare for her only coming once/month, and for what I believe is maintenance at this point. I know I am not able to justify that at all.
Advise?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why can’t you? Why are we stuck in the paradox of multiple visits per week. 
If they need it and it’s skilled. Do it. Also get them on a RTM program 

If it’s not skilled charge them your rate.

> **Response 2:** Maintenance requires skill to maintain and prevent decline. Therapy is provided because the clients can’t do it on their own, nor do they have someone who can do it for them. I would strongly argue that someone who can maintain and prevent decline with only monthly visits is not maintenance. Sounds like wellness to me.

What are the rules if a potential patient has insurance/Medicare but other family
Members want to privately pay for the services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I know there are sticky issues with Medicare patients paying cash rates but if they have insurance and want to pay (or have someone else pay) cash rates, that shouldn’t be an issue

> **Response 2:** With a Medicare patient you are obligated to bill Medicare if you are providing physical therapy. The threshold of physical is low meaning it must be skilled, necessary and reasonable. Other things to consider is if the patient/client perceives that you're performing physical therapy and you think you're providing an uncovered service, then it's still physical therapy because they think it is physical therapy and you are held to a higher duty.

How does one go about finding out what the maximum units we can bill per insurance? Like I know Medicare is 4 units max a day/an hour. But what about other commercial insurances.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can bill all you want but they will only pay a certain amount. I'd say be ethical and bill enough to cover all you do . Some emr I have used allow units for 2 min with WC and some commercial so we'd end up with 6-7 units . I usually changed them and included the 2 min with something else bc I felt guilty . I've never billed more than 5 for an hour

> **Response 2:** Commercial insurances. Check your contract with them. They usually follow Medicare. But not all.

Is there anything to do about the multiple or concurrent procedural codes denial on claims? I just got a Medicare EOB that shows denials on several visits for this reason and zero pay but it’s the same codes I have billed in the past on the same patient. 2 units of 97110 and 2 units of 97530.

**Community Responses:**

Hi all, I've tried to search the group, but can't find this answer...I am enrolled with Medicare, and out of network with Priority Health in Michigan.  I have a potential patient who has a Priority Health Medicare plan. If Priority Health has stated that I cannot enroll as a preferred provider, but I'm enrolled with Medicare, do I try to bill this patient through Priority Health?  I know I can't bill a Medicare patient cash for a service that would be covered, so not certain what to do in this situation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a patient I'm starting tomorrow with a Priority Health Medicare Advantage PPO plan in MI. I had to get preauthorization for it which took about a week. I filled it out as OON but when I got the Auth back they said they would bill as IN. The OON for them was a 40% coins, no ded. I'm still trying to call and talk to someone to see what the IN benefits are now that they said I can bill IN

> **Response 2:** You can call and verify benefits directly with priority health. If they have out of network benefits you can send the claims and priority health will let you know what amount the patient is responsible for.

**Original Post:**
Question for those who take PI cases where you bill the insurance company directly.

I have a client for PI that we would be billing State Farm directly for. We do have a prompt pay discount rate as well as a fee schedule that we bill to Medicare ($100/code for simplicity). The client has $15k in PIP and is seeing her primary care and received medications already. I don't necessarily need to make my actual fee schedule and eat through her PIP, but I also don't want to bill out my prompt pay rate when we will be waiting on payment for months. She does not have an attorney involved. 

My concern is if we bill out our rate of $4-500 a visit that we bill Medicare/out of network, is State Farm actually going to pay that or will they negotiate it down? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** they will pay what is reasonable and customary until PIP is exhausted.  but get your Bill's in quick, that money is there to share with all medical providers (docs, ambulance, hospital etc)

> **Response 2:** Depends on state rules, in FL pip is 10k once your over that you will need to go after the PI portion with all the other healthcare providers. Billing your max but reimbursement depends how much they get could 20-50%of your billed charges once the case is settled. Sometime you won’t see anything

I have a patient who hasn’t met her deductible. She said that she usually gets a bill from the insurance company after we bill. So she didnt want to pay my self pay rate.

I’m honestly just confused as to what she is even saying. So any thoughts?

I usually take payment upfront until they meet their deductible. And bill insurance. Then once deductible is met they cover coinsurance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ya that’s not how it works. She is mistaken.

Tell her how deductibles work and if she is unwilling to comply then move on.

> **Response 2:** Your business, your rules. If she doesn’t want to pay she can go somewhere else & rack up a bill. She may be confused thinking the remittance is a bill. Insurance wouldn’t bill her (at least I’ve never seen that happen). I think she’s confused. I’ve had patients call me in panic after paying my cash rate and then get a remittance they think is a bill from insurance. It’s not….

Question for those who have a hybrid practice (accept Medicare):
Do you need to notify Medicare if mobile services to a brick & motor practice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t know this for sure, because I am mobile.  But I’m guessing you have to add the practice address to your “locations” (so it’s billable) and bill on those visits for a different location/clinic code (12 = home).  I would personally either call your MAC or go to CMS website & look for the answer.  That way you know it’s correct! 😊

Do you guys charge for IE privately? I find it weird to bill an eval through insurance not even knowing if it’s medically necessary. Or do you bill the eval through insurance to determine medical necessity and that is reimbursable ? Hope that makes sense

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Determining something is not medically necessary is still skilled. Sometimes patients don’t explain things correctly over the phone. It only becomes an issue if you continue to see them once knowing.

> **Response 2:** IE can be skilled service, treatments don't necessarily have to be. In that, I mean you can do eval only and charge for it, while still determining that treatment is not necessary

Has anyone treated anyone with a long term care insurance policy? I have a potential patient who has both a LTC policy and Medicare. I called the LTC plan and asked if outpatient PT provided in the home was covered and they said “any service provided in the home is considered home care and is covered”. I clarified that this was technically OUTPATIENT PT, and she still said because it’s in the home it’s covered and she’ll just have to submit an invoice. She also has Medicare… can I go through the LTC instead of Medicare? Something is telling me I can’t but I’m not sure.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Bill Medicare for services that are medically necessary.  Once beneficiary reaches a point that they benefit from visits but do not require the skills of PT then bill LTC.  Orders may state that patient continues to benefit from balance, endurance, and/or strength training to maintain quality of life and the ability to age in place.

> **Response 2:** I feel like you should go through Medicare and bill LTC policy the difference? Just my thought process

Hello! I’m knocking on anyone who is kind enough to help my company pass the Medicare credentialing. We got rejected because they did not receive the document they requested (which I uploaded on the electronic application). I called Pecos hotline and they said it had to be paper based application which was contradictory to what the previous rep had said. I am so confused. We had started seeing couple Medicare patients needing wound care and lymphedema management. I had to stop taking referrals because of not getting reimbursed.  Please help.

**Original Post:**
So I am working on getting uncaged.
I work 20-25hs on my home health job, and I see about 14 to 16 - 1h sessions on my private practice. Most weeks I’ve been booked but in all honesty I haven’t really had a “waiting” list. So no need to make more spots available. 
The original goal was to save 2-3mo income and then get out. as far as debt, all we have is our mortgage and a $230/mo car payment. I am the breadwinner though.
So… the thing is, I am miserable. I am exhausted, my health is suffering, and I can’t keep going at this pace. I am so tired that most days I catch myself wishing patients would just cancel, so I can sit down and rest. I got gastrite and anxiety, am not sleeping well, and haven’t had sit down lunch in months (weekday I mean. There is no time for lunch, exercising, etc). 
My husband is telling me to just quit. While my ideal budget is 20 sessions a week, I can pay our bills at 13.5 sessions a week (if I ignore savings, taxes, and PTO). 
And right now I am already seeing these 13-14. so he is saying take the first 13-14 sessions, pay bills, and any session afterwards save for taxes etc (just while building a full time caseload). he feels if I am not so exhausted I will have time to go out and meet other professionals, market properly, etc. and worse case scenario if we get to next year without enough money to pay taxes, his 401k allows early withdrawal or loan for purposes of paying IRS. he also said if all go to “hell”, there are so many HH agencies in town with openings, that I can easily get a job starting next day. 
Thoughts? Is this a crazy idea?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It sounds like you have a very supportive spouse who is telling you what you need to hear. Do you have the option to go PRN that way if maybe you have a lighter private practice week that you can just pick up some extra hours?

> **Response 2:** My comment isn’t professionally related, but health related. Slow down and take care of your health before you health makes you slow down. It will happen either way. I’ve learned this from having multiple autoimmune diseases and it’s the best thing to come from those. I’ve learned to slow down, say no, and do self care.

Were any students forced to watch something like this before they signed on the line?? I’m a dinosaur so this wasn’t as big of a deal when tuition was $5,000/ year not $50,000.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Navigating this with my daughter now.  She’s an athlete (and has stellar grades) so we are hoping for very generous scholarships.

> **Response 2:** I wish! I started college in 2005 and graduated with my doctorate in 2011. I had no idea how much debt I was racking up. My financial advisor just got me the loans and did zero education as to how much I was taking out. So now my husband and I actually owe more in our loans then at did when we graduated over 12 years ago. Is really sad. He is a teacher making pennies while I bust my but as a PT just to put food on the table. My parents thought because they went to college and paid off their loans in a few years it would be the same for me. However between my husband and I we have over 200k of student loans. It’s nearly impossible to pay off with the income we’re bringing in and the student loan payments we make every month. They are more then our mortgage.

Wondering what the correct way of doing this is since I’ve heard some mixed info…when you track miles for tax deduction do you only track from your house to the clients or round trip? Thanks, have learned a lot from this group!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You track your mileage from patient to patient house. You’re not reimbursed from your house to your first patients house and from your last patients house to your home. Like you don’t get reimbursed to commute to/from work.

> **Response 2:** Your CPA will be able to help clarify. Jenni Lyn and Samantha Rothman are both right. 
Additionally, you are able to write off EITHER your miles OR a portion of your gas - but not both.  Again, your CPA can tell you which is most beneficial FOR YOU.

I am in CT, moving to MA next year - I have a hybrid pelvic rehab clinic in CT and considering going fully cash based in MA but also considering staying in network with BCBS only. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Take a look at Strata PT’s website for their real time reimbursement list. This will give you a good idea by payer and locations Generally, clinics are not supposed to share their contracted rates which is why most people won’t give you a straight answer on this question. For us, BCBS is a great payer in Mass and has been pretty easy to work with. The contracting process takes about 90 days and up to another 90 to add a new employee to your existing contract, so be ready for that, time/planning-wise.

Working on opening a PT/chiro business in a small town (6,000 people). I am starting as a cash based clinic and I’m finding different things when it comes to providing services for people on Medicare. I have found Medicare ABN forms and have also made my own for them to sign that they agree to not bill and submit to Medicare. Is the only way to see Medicare patients to accept Medicare or determine that they are a maintenance patient?
Any and all input is appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I recommend contacting Gwen Simons. She’s a PT and attorney who specializes in helping practitioners charge Medicare beneficiaries cash for service as well as providing you with the proper documentation for them to sign. It’s true that PTs can’t “opt-out” but you can unenroll. From my understanding, unenrolled providers don’t need to use ABNs and, as far as legal precedent is concerned, don’t need to abide by the fee schedule that Medicare requires enrolled, non-participating providers to use. Don’t take my word as law though, Gwen can help you out. If you just google her name with the word lawyer, it should come up at the top! Really good price for everything you get in my opinion.

> **Response 2:** Don’t make and user your own ABN forms. These are promulgated forms distributed thru Medicare MACs.

I have a patient who’s united healthcare Medicare advantage. He called and united told him that they do cover dry needling.

And he told us to submit it to his insurance.

Can we just tell him that we can give him a receipt and he can submit and that we won’t be submitting it?

I’m so tired of dealing with this that I just want to tell patients that we do not submit to insurance as they do not reimburse us for it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They'll tell the patient whatever they want to hear during enrollment period 😂, charge that patient whatever the hell you want

I’m looking to connect with other therapists who have transitioned from in-person visits (either in-clinic or mobile) to virtual visits (or hybrid model). I’m wanting to open up to some virtual visits but don’t want to reinvent the wheel or make it more complicated than it needs to be. Thanks!

I am a mobile PT and I have a potential patient who contacted me who would like to see me for PT. She has private insurance (BCBS). She just got discharged from a rehab facility and has told me home health will be coming in for nursing services. I’m aware that I would not be able to do this with Medicare insurance but am I allowed to treat her with private insurance while she is getting home health nursing services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The HH agency that is providing the nurse is responsible for providing all medically necessary services. That would include therapy.

> **Response 2:** No . She is home bound and outpatient cannot be billed while in home health skilled episode

For those who provide Superbills to clients: have any of your patients had payment denied for adding a modifier when insurance does not require it?

Just had my first patient get denied reimbursement bc  I did not add a modifier. To correct this, I thought I might add GP to all my CPT codes so I don't have to keep track of insurances, but worry that the other insurers will deny payment if I add the modifier when they don't require it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dumb question, i am really new and considering super bills as a route to go in, but what's a GP?

> **Response 2:** Are we suppose to use G59? And do you put on one code or all the codes you use?

I have a biller to handle claims. But I don't have a book keeper. I can't imaging it should be too hard to handle myself, but would like to make sure I have my 💩 together. Any recommendations for book keeping/small business finance courses or book keeping/business finance for dummy books? Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Honestly, just pay a CPA to do it for a year in quickbooks. After that, it will self categorize for the most part. Just leaving it quarterly to have the CPA confirm. Your time is valuable.

> **Response 2:** Better off billing yourself and outsourcing bookkeeping. Bookkeeping service are the cost of 1-2 patients. You will spend more time than that fooling with it yourself

**Original Post:**
Has anyone else had issues with Quickbooks not going back to the beginning of the year when linked to your business account? All of the settings are correct. I can see transactions from October to the end of the year, but it refuses to go back further. When troubleshooting, it tells me I can add my statements manually, which defeats the purpose of using the QB system.
What other bookkeeping systems do you use if not QB? I'd even settle for a spreadsheet at this point.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sometimes it’s a limitation of your bank, only able to go back 90 days. You may be able to download the CSV file and upload to QBO that way for Jan - Oct

> **Response 2:** I switched to Wave and have found it much easier than Quickbooks.

Tax Question:

If I am a 1099 employee but also have a small scale practice on the side, is my income from my 1099 job part of my personal business income as well.

Example: I made about 5k in each this year, 10k total. I spent about 7k on expenses and supplies for personal business.
Do I pay taxes on the 5k income from the 1099 job and mark a 2k loss in personal business, or would they be lumped together and I pay taxes on the 3k profit total?

Will also run this by my accountant for confirmation, but any insight is appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are a single member LLC or sole proprietor it all lumps into your personal anyway. Keep it all separate for acct but tax wise it's all together, the accts do the magic.

> **Response 2:** I was told that all untaxed income in related fields gets lumped together    But I keep it separate and present it  so my accountant can see.  They make the educated decision on losses and taxes.

Just received my first "$0" payment from Medicare...

It does have these codes "CO:119  [M25, MA13]" and said "Benefit maximum for this time period or benefit has been reached". Does this mean i just need to add the KX modifier possibly?

Thanks for any advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you guys! Glad it seems to be an easy fix!

> **Response 2:** Yes, edit the claim and add KX modifier.  You can check the patient's eligibility again and see if you passed the $ threshold for the year.

I have a patient has both tufts HMO (I am out of network)and VA insurance. Is one insurance reimburse better with PT? Also, with VA insurance, do I have to be in their network in order to provide care for their patient? Can I issue superbill to patient and VA insurance will reimburse later? Thank you very much for your insight in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** VA has to authorize treatment. Generally, you have to be a VA provider. In rare situations, if a VA provider type is not within a certain distance, the VA will allow an outside provider and will coordinate directly with that provider for payment. Patient will not be reimbursed via a superbill. The patient can pay for treatment, but shouldn't expect to be reimbursed.

> **Response 2:** Yeah you need to be in network with CCN and see who is the one overseeing for me it's UHC.

Does anyone balance bill for Medicare Advantage patients if you are out of network?  Or do you take the MA payment as paid in full?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are limited to Medicare rates if they have OON benefits

> **Response 2:** Like Heidi said, you can only balance bill if the plan does not have out of network coverage and you appropriately notified the patient of the cost of care. ￼

And in the situations, everybody should be charging their full bill rate for offering a prompt pay discount, both of which would typically be higher than the Medicare allowed amount.

Looking to finally get an EMR. Will be billing in-network for BCBS/Carefirst and Medicaid in a peds setting. I'm ~ 50% private/cash and 50% insurance. 
Debating between SimplePractice and Jane. Anyone have feedback on either? Priority for me is billing. Don't plan on hiring a biller just yet so will be managing it myself for the most part.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use simple practice and if you go with them let them know I referred you! I think there is a $200 referral bonus. Anyway I can’t compare to Jane but I bill BCBS and do cash services such as yoga classes, pain classes, etc. I bill MC but still working that out. Credentialing is done thanks to Sue Doyle (could not have done it without her), but I’m in process of figuring out how to interface EMR  with Medicare billing currently. The customer service help  with Simple Practice has been great. I am solo for reference .

> **Response 2:** SpryPT has worked well for us with a mix of cash and insurance. Everything stays organized and I don’t feel like I’m constantly chasing down payments

For those of you approaching/are in retirement, what are your experiences with Medicare as a patient?  (I’m a pediatric therapist so not as familiar as some with Medicare). I work for myself and am wondering if Medicare is sufficient or will I need to keep my private (self-employed) insurance. 

Is it good coverage that meets your needs?
If not, what other insurance options have you found helpful?
(Please reserve political debates for your own post :-)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Biggest problem I see as a HHPT is that people cannot afford caregivers or DME needed as they age. It’s very hard to get DME with Medicare and I believe only end of life insurance will cover caregivers. Maybe looking for a supplemental that has caregiver benefits. It’s such a strain on people

> **Response 2:** You need to buy supplemental insurance and drug coverage. Very good insurance. I am on traditional Medicare. Medicare replacements are less money but managed care. However I know many people happy with that coverage also. Recommend reading the Medicare and You booklet. You can get it through your social security office.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don't need to verify supplemental.  Make sure patient has signed up with MC for direct rollover to his/her BC.  Thus way when claim paid by MC, it rolls directly to BC and is paid timely.

Example: PT called me stating they were worried that there were two POCs and there can only be one and don't want to put their license on the line if there are too many POCs.
Context: I see the neuro population and some of them want more therapy than just twice a week, so they bring me in to sub that therapy.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you're both billing insurance then someone won't get paid. The patient is likely not going to get reimbursed for cash based services if they submit a superbill. 

No, there's no issue. Just misinformation from the other PT. Patients can choose to pay for additional services outside of what their insurance pays and classifies as medically necessary.

> **Response 2:** If they're providing the medically necessary PT services, you are likely providing services that wouldn't be covered by insurance. I know I've done this (provided supplementary services-private pay) with those on Home Health. I suspect the same would be true for OP but I don't have a reference for that.

Hello! I'm opening my own cash-based practice and plan to also be a participating provider for Medicare only. I have two questions:
1. I have an NPI Type 2 for my business. Do I put my NPI #1 or #2 on a superbill for patients? I updated the information on NPPES for my NPI #1, and I updated my I&A account.
1. I have previously worked for employers that were in-network with various insurances. My most recent employer was OON. I have a CAQH profile that has expired, as CAQH told me that I did not need to reattest for my most recent employer since that employer didn't use CAQH. Do I need to update my profile now since I don't want insurances to view me as in-network? Or is that not necessary since my NPI #1 and #2 are no longer affiliated with previous employers?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would keep CAQH updated. Medicare will typically want it updated. It doesn't put you in network with anyone but a way for insurance to pull your info.

> **Response 2:** For Medicare you'll need to submit the claims directly

**Original Post:**
For those of you who are cash based but provide superbills, did you have to do anything with the insurance company to get approved to provide OON services or for your patients to be able to submit and it count toward their deductibles? 

For example, I’m aware that I have had to get approved to be an out of network provider for Tricare, but what has everyone’s experience been with horizon, Aetna, etc

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I never did anything unless I was submitting billing on their behalf (OON) but even then I wasn’t approved or anything - sounds like extra work. Later on I transitioned to just providing superbills and patients submitting it to insurance on their own. They knew the risk of it being covered or not and were very comfortable

> **Response 2:** No

If you offer mobile services, can you charge a small travel fee if you take insurance?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hmmm.  Let’s maybe explore this idea.  For Medicare (and presumably any insurance) there is an ABN form that should be offered prior to services.  On the form, you would list a convenience fee of x dollars and for reason state not a covered service.  The client can accept or deny the responsibility and convenience.  One might argue this method has merit.  You could call Medicare to confirm this is valid.

> **Response 2:** I don’t think this would be legal

Hello! I was just curious if anyone knows how long it would take to receive an ERA and claim reimbursement after the first time filing with bcbs IL. Availity said it could take up to 30 days but typically not that long. I filed my first claims around November 13th and haven’t received any word back yet. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Typically, ERA and reimbursement processing times can vary. While Availity suggests up to 30 days, individual cases may differ. It's advisable to reach out to BCBS IL directly or check their online portal for the most accurate status on your claims. Hope you receive the information soon!

Huge billing success story with a HH agency overlap !!  

Many￼ of us have posted how when a home health agency overlaps us we are not paid for services.  After a year of negotiating we just got paid in this situation!!￼. 

Backstory - as we all know under consolidated billing, a home health agency is responsible for all medical services for the patient under their episode.   ￼This means Medicare is only paying one provider.  The agency trumps a therapy practice so per their regulations we don’t get paid.  There is the possibility to bill the agency for services provided, stating they are responsible for all skilled care, but I have never known them to pay because they honestly don’t have to.  

￼ In our situation we got paid due to our persistence.   ￼We were already in on the patient and the agency admitted with knowledge that we were already seeing. They nor the patient gave notice to us that they had admitted.  ￼ The patient had dementia, and family was not closely involved, so we really did not have a way to know.  ￼ Because the agency knowingly admitted the patient creating the overlap, I sent them the regulation about our ability to bill them for the services, and their requirement to cover all skilled care. After a very long and drawn out negotiation, they actually paid it.  ￼ Kudos to the agency for eventually doing the right thing.  

￼ I just wanted you to know there was hope for getting paid in this situation without having to involve attorneys or even Medicare!

Hi! Appreciate any insight...

My business uses a combo of mobile PT and treating in my clinic, which is attached to our home. I've been strictly cash based but am considering credentialing with Medicare. I've tried to research but haven't seen a clear answer
1. My understanding is that when applying to get credentialed, I could use my home address IF I were solely a mobile PT... but because my business also includes a clinic attached to my home, I can't**.** Is this correct?

 2. If that is correct, is there a way of applying for credentialing for only **MC mobile visits** but still be able to treat NON-MC clients at my home clinic? Or do I have to switch my business to 100% mobile and/or a separate physical location in order to get apply for credentialing? 

Thanks in advance for any input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can do either or both. 

You can use your home address for mobile as well as treating Medicare patients in your homes They would prob just want to do a site visit to confirm is a real place. 

If you wanted to just do mobile for Medicare but not in your home, I believe you should be able to select mobile only.

If you are in network with Medicare and bill Medicare B for reimbursement it's my understanding they will pay 80%. The other 20% of the cost can be covered by the patients secondary insurance. Do you have to be in network with the secondary insurance also? How does that work? Any help would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No.

If you bill Medicare and the claim is approved they will automatically forward the claim to the patients secondary insurance (as applicable) and you will be paid at Medicare rate for the other 20%.

Some secondary insurances still have a co-pay. Rare but I’ve seen up to $15.

> **Response 2:** If they have a supplement it will pay pretty much regardless I think but secondary insurance will sometimes require you to be in network so the patient may be responsible for the extra. You can call them to find out

Just have to decide if you want to accept assignment of benefits or not. Aka do you want insurance to send you a check or the patient.

Question.. when you're credentialing with an insurance as the sole proprietor of your business do you have to credential the business/ group and yourself as an individual provider as well? Or just the credential the business since you'll be submitting claims through the business NPI and TAX ID? TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It seems to vary by insurance. But I would always do group if possible because if you do add someone down the road, it will be easier to credential them with your group as well.

> **Response 2:** Why sole proprietor? LLC or PC would offer less risk against your personal property. Anyways, back to your question. As a sole proprietor, you are the business, so credentialing the business or vice versa is the same as credentialing you.

Hi guys!
For commercial insurances, is it allowed to bill the insurance for a session (i.e. 60 minute appointment of therex, manual, neuro-re ed etc.) and have the client pay out of pocket for additional time, for example 30 minutes of additional manual therapy that their insurance wouldn't cover?

**Community Responses:**

I just received a big batch of denied claims with error code n257. All billed to Medicare. Upon investigation it looks like this is explained as the billing/provider NPI is not accurate. I pulled up the submitted claims that were denied and compared to previous claims, no differences in NPI or other info.

Has anyone dealt with this? I will be calling to follow-up tomorrow just thought it to be very strange that 20+ claims from a variety of patients had this same error.

**Community Responses:**

Hi everyone! I recently started my own private practice with a PT as a neuro specialty clinic in WI. We have WebPT for our EMR and are trying to navigate the world of insurance authorizations and understanding pre-auths,copays,coinsurances and all items related to reimbursement. Are there resources that people found helpful for themselves that can help break it down? This is the part that is terrifying and intimidating!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your best bet is to just call the provider number on the back of the patient’s insurance card and work your way to an actual human. They will be able to break down all their benefits, whether you’re in network, copays/coinsurance, if prior auth is required, etc.

If I am paid with an FSA or HSA card - should I provide a superbill for them to put it towards their deductible?
TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No correlation between HSA payments and deductible. If you aren't in network they aren't getting any credit towards their deductible. And it sounds like you aren't.

> **Response 2:** Yes, you can provide a superbill and the patient can submit it directly to their insurance company to potentially count towards their deductible. The method of payment doesn't matter.

Such a not fun topic, I’d much rather talk PT, but what are all you solo practitioners doing to keep track of payroll taxes and all that stuff?  Do you hire an accountant or do it yourself??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do a little bit of both. I do run my own payroll through QBO desktop and my accountant has full access if I have any questions or need changes. I also keep track of all of our expenses via QBO desktop.

> **Response 2:** Accountant has access to my QBO & gusto accounts for tax time but I run payroll through Gusto manually & it tracks forms and pays taxes automatically. Super simple. Accountant also set up my gusto for me.

Health insurance question: health sharing organization like Christian Healthcare ministries or more traditional healthcare? Does the tax write off for your premiums outweigh the lower monthly contributions of CHM? For ex, $1200 insurance premium vs $700 CHM each month. Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have no idea what the tax write off is for health insurance, but paying 400 dollars a month with an 8k “deductible” is significantly better than paying 15k a year plan with 14k deductible. We have had Medi-share for 3 years and haven’t run into any issues! I’d love to hear what other people say. I can’t imagine the tax write off would save you more than the difference unless it was insane.

Hello we are hoping to go out of network for UHC. 
Can someone share the process. 
Also will going out of network affect our medica status ( which is managed by UHC)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First, be upfront with your patients about what the new costs will be. It’s super helpful to guide them on how to submit out-of-network claims for reimbursement.

It’s also a good time to rethink your rates, make sure they reflect your expertise but stay in line with what the market can handle. And make sure your documentation is on point. Insurers may ask for more detail for reimbursement, so thorough notes are key.

As you transition, your patient base might shift a bit, so think about how you’re communicating your value to justify the pricing. And about Medicaid — it usually won’t be impacted, but it’s always good to double-check just to be safe.

Hope that helps!

Two questions I am sure others have:

1. For deductibles in the new year, can I collect up to the contracted amount each visit up front, until the deductible is reached?
2. If I bill medicare $60 and they pay $40 and secondary pays $10, can I bill the patient for the remaining $10?

TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1. Yes, we do at our clinic. It’s the only way to ensure you receive payment. 
2. No, if the secondary has a copay, you can collect whatever the EOB indicates but not more.

Should I get in network with them?

**Community Responses:**

For those of you who take insurance:  When performing vitals checks in clinic-on patients on cardiac medications, when checking for appropriateness to continue exercise (not just as a routine/daily screen on patients with well managed hypertension) is there an appropriate code/way to capture that time? Do you roll it into something else? Or just eat it?
We found code 99211 which seems to fit, but there is mixed answers about whether or not we can legally bill it.

**Community Responses:**

Hey all. 

Medicare question here. I work for an OP Ortho company in NYC that is in network w Medicare (OON all other instrance though). 

When I check my personal NPI # on CMS website, my name comes up as a MCR provider. The address listed is my employer’s office and the entity type is “individual”. 

If I leave the practice I currently work for and open my own practice am I already considered “in network” with Medicare? Are there additional steps (other than changing the listed address) that I would have to take with Medicare to start seeing patients? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You need to have ur own place, apply for your group NPI and EIN, u will have to apply for Medicare certification and then they will process your papers, come for surprise inspection before they give u credentialling

> **Response 2:** That NPI you now have is your personal. You need to apply for an NPI for your business then reassign your personal NPI to it before you can see patients who have Medicare.

Free prize to the person with the right answer. Patient has Medicare and obviously a supplement. Patient also has long-term care insurance. Patient’s supplement does not cover Medicare deductible.

In the last year I have turned away about 5 medicare patients due to medicare laws (I've done my research thoroughly on this aspect).  I am cash pay, skilled intervention only, PT clinic.  There is an opportunity to possibly work 1/2 to 1 day per week at a local clinic and treat only medicare patients through that clinic.  A pay cut, and I'm okay with that since it would provide a service to a community that would have to drive 1.5-2.0 hours to a provider that takes medicare.

Depending on your contract with the clinic, you may be able to convert some Medicare clients to cash services after medically necessary services aren’t needed.

Edit: to clarify skilled vs medically necessary

Anyone in here work with strongman athletes frequently? Have a client with bilateral shoulder pain who I am evaluating this week. Previous labral repair and torn labrum in the other shoulder. My background is more heavily into powerlifting but assuming given the amount of overhead pressing (also what he’s having pain with) I’m gonna want to work on a lot of stabilization. And a lot will depend on what I find on Eval but any other big things I might not be thinking of for this population? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You’re probably already really well versed in all of this but on assessment I’d pay attention to T/S and lat mobility as well as shoulder IR mobility, strength, and endurance especially behind the back. Also throwing some things at them that they may not do frequently in training like bench dips, Turkish get ups, bamboo bar work along of your planned pressing may be helpful, too!

> **Response 2:** As mentioned above, overhead pressing is normally an issue, but also consider not simply overhead pressing but power production in the overhead position. 

And often in less than “biomechanically optimal” positions. 

So looking at thoracic mobility and control in those positions.

Folks with PRN work while you are trying to grow your practice.  How did you figure withholding when you have 3 jobs and have such varying “average amount per paycheck” numbers?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you’re already receiving a steady paycheck from your full time employment and getting paid as a contractor in your other jobs, you should have an excellent set of write offs in hand. Should allow you to receive a nice refund.

But this is definitely a great question for your accountant.

> **Response 2:** I just stuck with what my normal withholding is for all that pay me outside of my own business. I have a prn, a small school contract, and I teach adjunct. I'm hoping that by doing that, and keeping about 30% aside, I won't get completely blindsided come tax time.

I had a potential client reach out who is on Medicare. ￼I know that you cannot charge somebody cash for services that Medicare covers, but something like general wellness and fitness would be OK. However, the part I am curious about is, if I am a Medicare provider through my employed job, does that also make me a Medicare provider When I am working for myself as cash pay? ￼￼and if so, would I be able to bill Medicare as such?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Generally the answer is no. You are likely only reassigned to your employer.  I would need to look in PECOS to see how your account is set up. It is relatively easy to get credentialing with Medicare done. I do multiple a week for people

Questions for folks who have a solo cash practice on the side and work in-network elsewhere. 

I recently had a patient submit for out-of-network reimbursement for my services using the superbill I provided (she paid cash for the visit), but she was told by her insurance that I am in-network and that they tried to reimburse me instead of her (though I have not seen any reimbursement to that effect). In my superbill I state clearly that balance has been paid in full by the patient, to NOT reimburse me, and that I am out of network with all insurances. I do, however, work at another facility that is in-network, that is also associated with my NPI. 

Is this a matter of the insurance company being dumb and not reading the superbill, or have I run into a problem where insurance won't reimburse this patient? Do I need to include something different in the superbill to make things easier for my patients?

Thanks in advance for any advice

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you have a Type 2 NPI for your cash practice? Billing through that might help with the confusion from the insurance company.

**Original Post:**
Hi everyone,

I’m a mobile physical therapist currently transitioning to seeing patients as an out-of-network provider. I previously worked through Luna, but I’m now trying to handle everything independently.

I’m using JaneApp for EMR, Availity for insurance eligibility checks, and Office Ally as my clearinghouse. However, every time I download the 837P file from Jane and upload it to Office Ally, the claim either gets rejected or fails to meet the insurer’s standards. I’ve also tried submitting the claim manually through Office Ally, but it was still rejected.

I notice multiple input errors showing up in Office Ally once the file is uploaded, but I’m unsure which specific fields are causing the rejection. Since I only see one or two out-of-network patients right now, I’d really like to learn the full process myself before hiring a biller.

I don’t collect payment upfront or use superbills—I submit claims directly on behalf of the patient.
Is there any way to get a clearer explanation of what I’m doing wrong or any course/video that can walk me through proper claim submission step-by-step?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m having the same issues with Jane. The claim looks perfect on my end but when it’s sent to claim MD it’s missing information.

> **Response 2:** So I used Jane and office ally for about 2 years. I could probably take a look at your setup to see where the problem is. Feel free to DM me so we can trouble shoot.

I have a question about the what's-so on commercial insurance billing, specifically AETNA. 

I had a new patient whose benefits I checked via Availity. When I checked, it said that the patient had not met their deductible. However, once they did, they would have a co-insurance % to pay. 

When I saw the patient for the I.E., I charged him the full price at the end of the appointment. 

Today, I received a check from AETNA with a explanation of benefits. When I called AETNA to inquire why I received a check when he had not met his deductible, they told me that he had in fact met his deductible and the processing was correct. 

I know with Medicare, you cannot charge the patient more than what they say that the patient is responsible for, but is that the same for commercial insurance? 
The total amount of the check plus what the co-insurance that the patient is responsible for is less than the total of the initial evaluation. At the minimum, I plan to refund the amount of the check, but I wasn't sure if I could still charge them the difference that AETNA did not include in patient responsibility. Does anyone know?

Also, has anyone else had this sort of experience in which Availity says that their deductible has been met, but then the company says otherwise?  

Thank you for your time

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Availity is inaccurate…..all the time. We check availity and still call for verbal confirmation. It’s time consuming but it’s really the only way we can somewhat protect ourselves when we receive wrong information. If things are still processing availity will not be updated. And per commercial insurance, you are not allowed to charge more than the allowable or your contracted fee.

Patients who has commercial insurance and attends outpatient PT wants home visits from me (mobile PT) as well. I am only contracted with Medicare. Patient aware that my visits would be out of pocket. Is it worthwhile to even provide a superbill for patient to submit, knowing that it’ll be denied? I could alternatively justify as wellness based on what I’m working on with him on the superbill but not sure it would matter?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Honestly, if the patient knows it will be out-of-pocket and likely denied, I’d still give them the superbill, just with clear expectations. Some patients get lucky with partial reimbursement or at least use it for FSA or HSA purposes.

If you’re worried about the medical necessity side, you could code it as wellness or maintenance, especially if that’s really what you’re working on. Just avoid giving the impression it’s skilled PT covered by their plan, or you might be setting them and yourself up for frustration.

Bottom line: it probably won’t get reimbursed, but if they want the paper trail and you’re transparent, it doesn’t hurt.

> **Response 2:** If it's on top of what they're already getting, then you're already going beyond what has been determined to be medically necessary (by the other evaluating PT).

Doesn't hurt to offer this person the option of a Superbill. 🤷

They might get something for it.

Anyone have any experience regarding patients getting reimbursed for wellness treatments through long term care insurance?

**Community Responses:**

Hive mind question: I have a patient that wants to pay cash to see me because she has a high deductible for her insurance. My business contracts with another company that is in network with her insurance and typically I see patients that way (kind of like Luna). My business isn’t in network with her insurance, but I haven’t gotten my own billing/EMR system up and running yet. I don’t have my own type 2 NPI either if that matters. My question is this: is there a simple way for me to see her as a cash payment patient under my own business, and if so are there resources on what I would need to do for documentation if I just did the documentation the old fashioned way without an EMR? Or is this a little too complicated for a patient who will probably only be seeing me a handful of times? Thanks in advance, and I’m in Washington State FYI.

**Community Responses:**

Let's say I charge a patient $75 an hour and provide a super bill for them to submit to their insurance. The insurance goes off of 4 units per visit and determines the units were $100 worth of therapy. The patient has co-insurance of 20% and the insurance pays back the patient 80% of the bill, being $80 a visit. Is that how it would work? It doesn't seem right

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The insurance can say since you accepted $75 then the 80% is off of $75. Discussed in length at PPS.

> **Response 2:** Assuming the superbill listed insurance rates? Not the PP rate of $75? I've seen many profit on their own Healthcare and no, that shouldn't happen. It all depends on what you list your CPT prices at.

> **Response 1:** Answer from chat GPT: No, a physical therapist cannot have a patient on Medicare sign a waiver to bypass Medicare and charge cash for covered services. Medicare has strict rules about billing, and providers must bill Medicare for services that are covered unless they have opted out of Medicare.

If a service is covered by Medicare, providers must submit a claim to Medicare, and patients cannot be asked to pay out-of-pocket for that service. There are some exceptions for non-covered services, but for covered services, bypassing Medicare is not allowed.

In rare cases, a physical therapist who has officially opted out of Medicare may have private agreements with patients, but this requires specific formalities.

> **Response 2:** I know multiple outpatient clinics (privately owned) in my area that make patients sign ABNs thus giving up their Medicare rights and also avoiding the clinic from being audited. They have some patients on caseload for 3+ years.

They probably will never be investigated by Medicare. Do I agree it’s wrong 100%. But people do what you are saying 100%.

Opening an output ortho clinic. Planning on seeing MC and BCBS as in network, rest cash. My question is- am I able to see these pt and bill them while I'm still getting my MC enrollment done? I have been in output pt ortho setting for 18 years so I do have  PTAN etc.  I have heard it can take up to 3 months even if I have been previously billing MC. Am I able to hold claims? Looked through Novitas and MC website and got even more confused. Appreciate your responses. Thanks

**Community Responses:**

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I'd like some clarification as I'm still learning all of the ins and outs of billing insurance companies. My significant other was talking to his mental health counselor about my new physical therapy practice, and the counselor gave him some advice on insurance. We're based out of Iowa, and in Iowa, most people either have Wellmark BCBS of Iowa or Anthem BCBS, which is actually based out of New York (I believe). He said that he just runs my SO's insurance as Wellmark BCBS of Iowa, and Wellmark will bump it over to Anthem, and it still gets covered as in network. Can anyone verify this or tell me if this is correct? I have a long time patient of mine who has BCBS of NC but if I can just bill it to BCBS of Iowa and they'll send it to BCBS of NC and it will get covered, that sounds pretty enticing. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look on the back of the card and if it says “bill with local Bcbs” then you should be good. 
I am in KC and we get a lot of different BCBS but we file with our local, unless it says otherwise. Be sure with anthem you are calling for auth

> **Response 2:** My understanding is that if you’re in network with your local BCBS you are in network with any BCBS. It just gets tricky verifying benefits and getting auth as different states use different 3rd parties for authorizations. We’re in WI and have billed BCBS from other states and been reimbursed.

I know we can not for Medicare unless its non covered service but what is the rule for Medicaid? 

Thank you

**Community Responses:**

But I find it incredibly ridiculous that a Medicaid patient would be able to afford cash based services. 
Our practice is almost 50% Medicaid—WV. We are accepting these low reimbursements because they are on Medicaid. 
But then affording cashed based services?! It just feels like a slap in the face.

Has anyone’s anthem insurance covered dry needling?

Not sure what to say when patients say their “insurance covers dry needling”

We have yet to get reimbursed by anyone when I tried submitting in the past.

And I just want to be like “that’s our self pay out of pocket price for dry needling. We do not submit insurance”

They just don’t understand and keep annoying us about it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have them pay up front and state if their insurance ends up covering it, their payment will count towards their other sessions or be reimbursed

Question for HelloNote users.  I am mostly Medicare but recently took my first cash client.  I set up the eval and regular visit cash rates in the system but on my eval I still chose CPT codes.  Now when I try to pull a bill or statement for this patient it comes up with the rates for those codes.  What am I doing wrong and what do I need to do to fix this?

If someone is being seen under worker comp (Slip and fall resulting in a TBI/concussion), and the current therapist wants to refer to us for concussion rehab. Can we see them under Medicare vs work comp?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Tricky. Some wc cases will deny them and have the patient pay themselves if they use their own insurance too soon and see someone outside of their recommendations, some docs won't even see them if it's an open claim. If the claim is open, the therapist might have to talk to the claim manager to see if the new treatment can be added. Insurance might also deny you if it's an open wc case, and they were hurt at work. Not sure about Medicare specific, but nowadays some insurances are looking for a way out to deny claims. 

Saw a case where a pt was using their insurance to try to get back to full duty at work and the insurance denied all their visits and said it should have been auto being billed from an accident months prior, the pt was contacting their lawyer. Frustrating. Hope you get more answers you are looking for more specific to your case.

> **Response 2:** Call the WC adjustor and explain the situation, proceed accordingly.

They are typically very helpful.

And WC pays better than Medicare

Really simple and pretty common for W9 to be requested.

Edit: Rereading your post it looks like the patient is looking for reimbursement not you? Same process just make sure you’re not “accepting assignment” when providing superbills or CMS-1500 otherwise payments will be sent to your company vs the patient.

One of my clients submits for out of network benefits and recently I am getting eob’s from her insurance as in network.

My question is , since she pays me directly,  should I do anything about or just ignore? 
Wondering if there is any tax or reporting issue (it states reported to IRS “0.00” on the eob.

I want to be more consistent with my billing. But I typically wait until I have all plan of care signstures.

I don’t have an issue with getting the signatures but sometimes thenphysicians can take an extra week or two.

Knowing this, would it be okay to submit the billing before receiving the signed plan of cares? But knowing I’ll get the plan of care within the next 1-2 weeks?

My billing is so slowed because of having to wait on them. So I want to be better.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As long as you are making a valid attempt to contact the physician, you can bill.  Make yourself a contact log and document each time you've contacted the physician to prove that you are making valid attempts.  I attempt 3 times before giving up, but that doesn't ever stop me from getting paid.

Wanting to provide superbill for people but needed a little bit clearer idea. I know they have to have out of network coverage and not all of them provide full reimbursement. Do you bill the allowable codes then provide some kind of adjustment to reflect the cash rate or do you just bill your cash rate per session? 

How do the patient find out this information. And how do they submit the superbill? Has anyone had people that actually get reimbursement? How long did that take?

I’ve heard about Reimbursify as well and did trialed it with someone but he did get reimbursed.

**Community Responses:**

Hi there, long member first time poster here. Just curious - has anyone here dealt with any clients that have “long term care insurance” such as through Transamerica or one of these companies.

I have patient that I was seeing through Medicare part b (outpatient at home), and recently discharged them as they were approaching their “cap.” I offered private services thereafter, which they are interested in but are adamant about using this long term care insurance (I am growing a cash based business at the moment and do not take insurance). They are willing to pay out of pocket but would like to seek reimbursement independently through transamerica. Can anyone offer any insight into this? Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So a couple of things. There is no thing as a cap for Medicare patients. Consistently discharging patients at or near the threshold is one key thing that is likely to trigger an audit from Medicare. If they are needing skilled medically necessary services this continues to be covered by Medicare. I have had clients who have used their LTC insurance. I have printed the CMS1500 form noting they had paid with an invoice through my EMR.

Buyer beware post: if anyone has considered working with Athelas for RCM billing, please be cautious and ask for references. They overpromise and way underdeliver. I worked with them for two months to go live and the day before, they told me they couldn’t work with my EMR effectively and left me in a huge lurch without a biller and having screwed up my billing systems dramatically. It took my new biller over a month to fix the damage they caused and her payments in again. And I didn’t even make it to go live. I hadn’t posted about them as I didn’t want to spread mh distaste, but I’ve talked to two other clinicians who have had the same experience now and I suspect there are others. It’s kind of like Fyre festival..the have an idea they’re selling, and a great sales pitch to go with it, but they haven’t actually worked out how to pull it off😡

Hello My Fellow Colleagues,

Is anyone out there seeing Medicare beneficiaries for wellness, fitness, prevention (WFP) for CASH? Anthony Maritato has some great YT vids on this, but I'm still looking for clarity.

1. I understand Medicare will cover maintenance if skilled care. Otherwise, are all WFP needs automatically defaulted as non-skilled and would never be covered by Medicare?
If non-covered, what's the point of an ABN? Other than purely a voluntary ABN to cover you maybe ?

2. Client wants help establishing a year long plan but wants/needs assessment. What's unclear to me is...let's say they have mobility issues, no pain. How do I assess shoulder dysfunction outside of a skilled care lens? Aren't I, as a DPT, examining shoulder mobility...as a DPT?? How do I know what will suit them best for a year long program and more if I don't eval and examine them (which, arguably, feels like a skilled function)?

3. Lastly, are there any restrictions/limitations on what I can charge for non-covered Medicare services since they still technically have power and authority over us and I'm not allowed to opt-out of their program like every other practitioner can?

Thank you for ANY info. 

Signed,
-Tried to get out of the cage, cage keeps dragging me back in.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have several cash-pay clients that have been to and don't want any further "therapy."  They want a highly skilled personal trainer who can program and progress exercises for general strength, balance, etc in the presence of their chronic conditions.  They have confidence in me because of my medical background.
I also started a group fitness class for 55+, so am reaching more people and helping them reach their fitness/function goals with an evidence-based program.

> **Response 2:** 1:  ABN not required for wellness services/non-covered services.
2:  You can bill eval to determine if there are further skilled needs or not.
3:  No restrictions on what you charge for non-covered services.  If you are not providing a skilled service, then Medicare does not have "power and authority" over you.

So I'm just getting started.  Got the LLC, EIN,  and insurance.  My niche is seniors but a mother is asking about me seeing her 17 year old who  was in MVA with UE and LE  fractures; Aetna insurance.  I was planning on cash only  in my LLC to keep my life simple.  I need to choose an EMR so I can generate a superbill.  The question is, should I go with cash only, get the EMR and generate a superbill for the patient, or at a rate of 150 a visit, would I be better off to become a provider  for Aetna? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should check to see if auto is the primary payer. Also if your primary niche is seniors you may want to think about getting Medicare credentialed as we cannot opt out and therefore cannot charge cash for services.

> **Response 2:** I use google docs as a EMR and provide a super bill for the patient after each visit.

So today I got a call from a potential client who has Medicare as her primary insurance consulting for her shoulder. I know that we can’t see Medicare for cash pay for traditional PT, but we can for wellness. 

How would you guys go about with this conversation? It seems like she’s more interested in where I am and price. I was trying to explain to her that I can see her only for wellness and maintenance, but didn’t get to explain in more detail before she hung up.

My practice is mainly mobile in CA and I don’t have a physical clinic.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just be upfront that you aren’t able to see her for medically necessary services but you would be more than happy to help her find a Medicare provider. You can explain once she’s discharged if she needs assistance keeping up with her program you would love to help. You may get a new client in the long run and a reciprocal referral source out of the other therapist.

> **Response 2:** That you cannot see her for medically necessary skilled services

**Original Post:**
One of my medicare patients is going to be having a procedure performed will likely be admitted to the hospital overnight afterwards. When I worked in a hospital-based outpatient clinic, our policy was to discharge a patient if they were admitted to the hospital, and then get a new order from the MD and re-evaluate them when they came back to outpatient PT. Is this a Medicare policy (since hospital admissions are under Medicare A and outpatient PT is Medicare B)? Or was this just a site-specific policy? What does everyone else do in this situation? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I never saw this when I did outpatient therapy but in home care if patient is admitted then we do need a new order and evaluation.

> **Response 2:** You do need a new order to be able to return after an admission.

Hey all, quick question. I just spoke to a potential client who asked me a question I didn’t know the answer to. I’m cash based but will give clients a superbill for them to seek reimbursement. She was told by her insurance company that she needs to do PT first before an MRI is approved for them to check out a potential cyst on her hip. She asked me how does she prove to them that she did the PT with me(being that I’m not getting auth or submitting claims to them?) Do I just give her my notes and have her submit them to her insurance company?
She is not concerned really with reimbursement, she just wants to have the imaging done to rule out something more serious. 
Has anyone encountered this as cash based?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've created a superbill and a signed letterhead note written to their physician stating rationale for mri. Like David said, the patient should be able to call their insurance to find out exactly what information is needed that you can then provide them.

> **Response 2:** Best to just call the insurance company to ask. Probably some kind of note with a letterhead or medical records from you

**Community Responses:**

This is not for me (I swear). I have a patient that is being discharged from home health speech therapy. He wants to attend outpatient PT in a pool and still needs speech very much. He has fallen on his last two outings for appointments. Anyhoo, it dawned on me that there is an outpatient speech therapist (brick and mortar) a 2 minute drive away. I called to ask if she would be willing to come to him and she said logistically yes but was not sure if she could legally. We are in California. My question is, if she has a brick and mortar business, can she provide outpatient speech at his house without doing anything else? 

Thank you so much in advance for the info. I just don't want this patient to have a gap in services.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can here in NC. But she may also want to check with her insurance provider to make sure she’s still covered outside of her business location

> **Response 2:** Depends on the State practice act and the type of Medicare number she has.  We are allowed to do “offsite” visits with our Medicare number in Florida

**Original Post:**
What factors do you consider whether to do OON billing for patients vs giving them superbill/reimbursify? Obviously doing it for them is more work. Anyone have any insight (especially if you have done both)?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do OON billing when:
They have OON benefits with low deductible (<$2500 - arbitrary based on typical POC for my patients) or have already met their deductible AND high reimbursement rates (UCR based fee schedule)
I give a Superbill to people who have OON benefits with high deductible (>$2500) or low reimbursement rate (Medicare percentage based or their own that is lower than UCR rates).

> **Response 2:** Factor the OON billing into your rates. If you are set up with a clearinghouse, OON billing is pretty simple.

Does anyone know how long it is supposed to take for credentialing? Sent in my applications via a local credentialing agent in March, received a declined letter in late April/Early May due to a “bank letter” issue. Just curious if it’s supposed to take 90+ days? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I applied in middle of March, I received a bank letter issue too but received a letter to fix it before any denial. Fixed the bank issue, and was credentialed by May. My credentialing company alerted me to the issue immediately and I was able to resolve that (and one other issue) and got approved! Also, my bank letter was created online and instead I did a voided check the second time and they accepted that immediately

> **Response 2:** Not sure who you have to use but mine is Palmetto GBA and it has NOT been good.   Hopeful your path is better and those you work with are more helpful

For me, if it doesn't serve my business in a clearly explainable way, then I don't deduct it. (I'm also a tax coward.) Normal haircut? Not an expense. Haircut with the intent to get new headshots and film content? Business expense.

Want to know people’s thought on SBA loans.

We’ve been mobile for about 9 months and renting a co-op space for treating in clinic. With myself and another PT employee the rent is going to be somewhere between $1400-$1600 depending on how busy we are. 

I’ve been thinking about taking out a SBA loan to get equipments for our brick and mortar location.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** SBA loans are just loans that the government will guarantee if you don’t qualify at a traditional bank.  

They also require collateral. Which most don’t want to collateralize your asset such as a house for a business.  Many do, however. 

The end of the day the question is do you need the capital now, if so why?  If the business isn’t going well the capital will only extend your off ramp to failure. 

If it’s for growth   That’s wonderful just don’t bite off more than you can chew.    I would argue you need 10-25k to start a B&M max.   If you can save it up yourself personally then loan that money back to your business at a fat interest rate. Somewhere between 20-28%    You just made money on your money instead of losing money 

Don’t go to a bank 
Become the bank!

> **Response 2:** If you need an SBA loan then you don't have enough capital to start imo

Thoughts on using a CPA for tax questions for your side business? Any cheaper ideas to figure out things like equipment write offs?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Absolutely consult an expert when it comes to taxes. It’s not worth using word of mouth or cutting corners with this type of stuff. 

Just like we want people to come to us for our expertise (and for a reason), the same goes for other professionals. Protect yourself and your business 👍

> **Response 2:** Equipment isn’t a write off, but if it’s capital equipment you can write off the loss of value, like you would a house. The cpa knows those rates. Same with a company car, you need to write ofg value lost that year but not the whole car.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It sounds like this is a Medicare Replacement plan - not Medicare.

> **Response 2:** Yes. This plan most likely has OON benefits being PPO. You will confirm benefits for OON and then you will bill. Reimbursement will be based on Medicare Fee Schedule. At this time of the year, need to check OON deductible etc. as well as Copay. You can ask for payer ID when you call and submit electronically through your EMR.

This is just an idea in the works and planning stage.

Good morning and happy Friday the 13th group😱😳. Someone might have posted this question before but I have a former patient that reached out to me that I was seeing through another company I contracted for via her insurance (Medicare). She recently reached out to me and stated that she has been having issues with another problem, that doesn’t require surgery but her physician want her to go to PT. She reached out to my business and wanted me to help her with a training program that could help her but she wants to pay cash. Medicare confuses me, is this a 👍🏿 or 👎🏿, thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The simple guideline is you can't take cash from some one with Medicare for medically necessary services, other than the 20% co-insurance patient responsibility (assuming they don't have a secondary) or their deductible if it's unpaid. 

If you've done an evaluation and determined that services are not medically necessary/don't require the skills of a PT, then you can create and charge for a wellness program. 

PT's cannot opt out of Medicare like medical providers can.

Document the heck out of it and assess your own risk tolerance. 

According to a number of individuals, there are very specific methods to try to work around this for medically necessary services. If you're asking this question here, and have not set yourself up with good legal advice for those ways, you don't want to consider them.

Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I could be wrong, but I think if you aren’t in network, by default you are out of network (obviously with Medicare as the big odd exception).

> **Response 2:** You don't have to do anything with UHC for patients to submit their superbill. Just give it to them and let them deal with UHC. You do the OON credentialing with insurance of you plan to bill the insurance directly.

Has anyone filed with their state insurance Director for violation of timely payment of claims against United healthcare?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Subject: Urgent Assistance Needed: Delayed Payments from UnitedHealth Group Subsidiary

Dear Director Ann Gillespie,

I am writing to bring to your attention a critical issue that is impacting numerous healthcare businesses in our state, including my own. As a small healthcare business owner, I have been severely affected by the recent cyberattack targeting Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group.

The cyberattack, which occurred in February, resulted in the shutdown of the data clearinghouse that serves a significant portion of U.S. medical providers, patients, and pharmacies. As a consequence, payments from UnitedHealthcare, a key payer for many healthcare providers, including my business, have been delayed for over two months.

This delay in payments has created significant financial strain for my business, as well as countless others across the state. Despite repeated attempts to address the issue with UnitedHealthcare, we have not received any satisfactory resolution or timeline for when payments will be processed.

Furthermore, the impact of these delayed payments extends beyond just financial hardship. It has disrupted our ability to provide timely and quality care to our patients, as well as caused significant operational challenges.

I am reaching out to you, Director Gillespie, in the hope that you can provide assistance in addressing this urgent matter. Specifically, I am seeking your support in advocating for healthcare businesses like mine to receive the payments owed to us by UnitedHealthcare, along with any associated interest and fines for the delayed payments.

Given the widespread impact of this cyberattack on the healthcare industry, I believe it is imperative that state authorities take action to ensure that affected businesses receive the support and assistance they need to recover from this crisis.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter further and explore potential solutions to mitigate the financial and operational challenges facing healthcare businesses in our state.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,
K Joy Lind, PT 
President 
Enjoy Mobile Rehab

Will someone explain how oon works. I was not aware that we could bill insurances we are not credentialed with. How does this work and are we usually paid?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** OON typically has a separate deductible, different copay/coinsurance and so you most likely aren’t going to end up getting paid by the insurance unless their plan has met the deductible like normal. It works the same as in network and they will usually try to negotiate what they pay you/their client pays. They have to have out of network benefits stated in their plan though. A lot don’t.

> **Response 2:** I’m OON with most ins. I check on availity for their benefits. About 35% of the time it matters. Different deductible … copay etc.  some are so low they don’t care. Other plans there is no difference. PT doesn’t matter if it’s in or out. Same/ same. I’ve never been screwed on an OON patient

I have a client wintering in Miami. 

Location update 

The zip code is 33132. She is in the downtown area near Bayfront Park

She needs PT and OT post stroke recovery therapy. She has been going to both clinic therapy and having our concierge sessions in home. Need recommendations for her to find nuero specialists to work with . Insurance based or private. Options would be good. MOD -MAX assist for most activities.

Is an online exercise class a qualified HSA expense? Anyone know how to get your services approved by HSA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Agree with Anthony’s statement.  The insurer would need to get a letter of medical necessity from their physician with a medical diagnosis.  
For example, Optum has a form that a provider can use to qualify as a LMN to use Optum HSA. 
Have the insurer check into their own HSA carrier to see what is required.

> **Response 2:** My gym just started working with truemed- you can fill out a survey on your medical history and they will send you a letter of medical necessity if you qualify based on your responses. I wonder if you could do something like that? Not sure if it matters if it is online vs in person?

I operate as a mobile cash based practice and had a client submit a superbill to her insurance that covered 3 sessions (including eval) and their reply was that all the codes must be 97001 (eval code). Is there a reason they would do this other than just being clueless insurance and making excuses to not reimburse her? I haven’t had many clients submit one.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Insurance is clueless. That code is no longer used.

> **Response 2:** Some insurances use the same code. If I remember correctly Humana really like the re-eval code

Hi, questions for seasoned private practice PTs! What are the cons when taking insurances? Do solo practice gets paid less than big hospitals/ franchise clinics from insurances? Or gets denied? Why did you stop taking insurances if cash based? I'm trying to decide which model I need to go with. My specialties are pelvic/lymph. Any thoughts on which model would be better for these specialties? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** i am currently trying to do both. I work for someone else in a clinic (I’m also pelvic floor) and there I am just about maxed out on the pay scale because of what insurance reimburses us. I am trying to start a cashed based virtual practice so I have a little more freedom

> **Response 2:** When you go insurance a lot of people talk about insurance dictating what you can and can't do with clients. But when you go the cash pay route you can do what's best for your patient plus you'll have more Financial Freedom going that route. Pelvic floor and lymphedema are really good niches and people definitely do pay cash for that.

Also, you will see a different type of client most of the time with cash vs insurance. Cash clients are typically more proactive about their health from what I have seen.

I have a treadmill, nu step, therapy table, and some workout machines set up in my garage that I got free from a gym that went out of business. The workout machines in particular I feel could benefit certain patients. I'm seeing mostly Medicare and insured patients in CA if that matters. Eventaully I hope to put them in an office, but it's not financially feasible now. Thanks!

Right now I have g Suite as my EMR and it works well, but cash only hasn't been working for me and i think i need to start accepting insurance since.... recession. how many insurance claims can you totally deal with before hiring out more help? how much do the EMR programs actually help with that too make it worth the subscription? I'm thinking of non par Tricare (according to their website West isn't accepting new applications for part providers unless it's behavioral health), Medicare (not sure if i want to do par or non par), and BCBS

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We did mostly insurance with some cash using G Suite (just BCBS and Early Intervention at the time).  It wasn't too bad at all.  We have an EMR now and it really didn't make too much of a difference other than we can use the clearinghouse to submit claims and have all patient records in one place.  It's just my partner and I and we haven't had to hire administrative help yet (but it is a dream of ours because we spend many hours working on admin stuff unpaid).

> **Response 2:** I am working on trying to figure out how to make it so you can submit a file to a clearinghouse using Google Workspace right now. It’s a more powerful tool than what most people realize.

Hi. Question. Pt has Medicare, but wants to be seen for wellness (we are in-network with Medicare); wants to pay cash, other than ABN what else do I need to have the pt fill up? Do you still ask for the Medicare # for your records? Do you still submit a POC to the Dr? Thank you very much.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wellness is never a covered service. A voluntary ABN is reasonable. Follow the voluntary ABN guidelines.

Follow state practice act requirements in regards to doctor and POC.

You are free to charge your wellness rate and you are not limited to Medicare allowed amounts.

**Community Responses:**

In order for you to practice your profession, you have to be licensed in the state where you practice. So your business registration is your tax question and the provision of the services is per state, practice act rules.

I have a current referral that lists the patient as having Medicare as primary insurance, BCBS PPO as secondary. When I went to verify, it says Medicare part A and B active coverage. But it also says her BCBS is a Medicare advantage…. 
So does she just have Medicare advantage?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, this patient just has Medicare advantage. The MAC portal will always say Medicare part a and Medicare part B eligible or active, but that doesn’t mean they actually have those plans. 

Since it’s a PPO, you can assume there would be out of network coverage, so you would want to charge the patient the Medicare part be allowed amount and if the patient wants you to submit claims you can do it as a convenience, but you would be limited to what the plan allows. ￼￼

If it goes through an attorney or insurance, then you'll have to wait until the claim is closed to get paid. That can take time. I've seen 3 months and I've seen years.

Would love some knowledge and expertise on this as I’ve been scratching my head thinking about this the last few weeks!

I am new to the cash based physical therapy game as well as just simply billing insurances as I worked full time as a home health PT-all the billing, etc was handled by the company I worked for.

I am currently starting a cash based practice and I know we provide superbills for patients. I have written that we do not bill insurance directly but will provide superbills if needed to submit to insurance companies for possible reimbursements and to contact said insurance companies prior to starting with me for information on what’s covered. 

Should I offer cash based services and get in net work with some major insurance companies or just provide superbills? I’m confused because I feel if I accept some insurances it may make it a lighter financial burden. 

Can someone expalin the pros and cons of superbills vs getting in network with certain insurances  or even how to start that process. 

A little lost 🤐

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It depends on what you want to do..

Insurance based practices don't have a shortage of patients and people will go to see an insurance based provider regardless of their skills simply because they are in network...and I get it because premiums are expensive so people want to use their insurance. As a provider accepting insurance you do have to play by insurances rules (authorizations, documentation requests, reimbursement limits, co-pay and/or co-insurance collection, etc)

For cash based you can give a superbill and move on. It may take longer to build your clientele simply because some people want to use their insurance. You have the flexibility of setting your rate and determining the need for treatment without insurance influence.  You also don't have the same administrative requirements for billing submission, authorizations, etc. 

Insurance reimbursement is generally less than cash based; however, depending on your market and target audience it may make sense for your business model. 

I personally am non-par with Medicare and limit the number of Medicare patients ai have on my caseload at one time. Otherwise, I am completely cash based. I used to run a busy outpatient clinic that accepted most major insurances and some of those insurances were an absolute pain to work with. Others, weren't bad. Still, you have to run the numbers and see what works for your business model.

Also, I think it is important to understand that not allow services or physical therapy needs are truly covered by insurance and that in these situations, cash based is acceptable.

I'm getting tripped up on the rules for billing OON/cash for federal insurance plans. I understand that I can't bill Medicare / Medicaid as out of network / cash. I'm in Washington State, and I have a past patient that wants to see me with Molina insurance which I'm out of network for. In Washington, Molina services Medicaid plans, and Molina also has commercial plans on the Washington State Insurance Marketplace. I called Molina to check this patient's benefits and Molina confirmed that the plan was a commercial marketplace plan. There is no out of network benefit for the plan, and the customer service representatives were unsure if this particular Molina commercial plan counted as a federal plan and would therefore be illegal for me to bill cash. They did advise me that I needed to request prior authorization as a non-participating provider. Can anyone advise me on how to confirm whether Molina marketplace plans would follow the federal payer rules prohibiting OON/cash in my state, or who to call to sort this out since the Molina call center reps don't know?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ive noticed alot of customer service representatives for commercial insruances are not familiar with private pay clinics and so when they give advice they play it safe and just say “a prior authorization is needed” its even more difficult when a patient reaches out to them because a huge number of patients still doesn’t know the difference between in and out network.

> **Response 2:** You can bill cash pay for Molina if it's commercial

Sole proprietor vs PLCC for Medicare b mobile side hustle?

I’m in NY. First I thought I would go the PLLC route but since learned maybe I don’t have to and also legal protections aren’t so great anyway.?

So question- any reason I definitely SHOULD jump through the PLLC hoops vs just credentials with my NPI type 1 and also if I grow later how much of a pain is it to switch?

I would be happy seeing 3-5 Medicare b sessions per week in my neighborhood in addition to my regular job. So think really small.

I work for a home/community neuro program that is not covered by Medicare. Today I learned that my patient is receiving home health PT. We are definitely treating her with skilled therapies, not “wellness,” albeit focused on community reintegration (in her home and in various communtiy locations) but Medicare does not pay for our model. She is privately paying for our program. 
I’m wondering everyone’s thoughts on the situation. Minimally I think she may be ineligible for home health and should be using Medicare for outpatient therapies, but is there any issue on my end with treating her if Medicare doesn’t pay for my company’s model? Should I do/say anything or keep my head down and keep treating her?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just a guess that it’s Rehab Without Walls 🫣 cool idea but there are questionable ethics at play!

> **Response 2:** If it is skilled therapy that is medicallynecessary, then I would ask why medicare is not being billed. Even if Medicare doesn't cover your company's model, then the patient should be referred to a provider who is able to bill Medicare. Now if services are not medically necessary per Medicare's guidelines that's a different story. If homehealth is present that service is billed under part A and part B cannot be used at the same time. If additional services are desired by the patient outside of what home health is providing that can be a cash service even if it is skilled.

I'm not sure if this answers your question or not, but hopefully it helps some.

I’ve narrowed down domain ideas to the following two. Which do you think would be best for a hybrid mobile/online company? (The .net option is because that was taken in its .com variation… And the .com option here lists state initials at the end instead)

The downside is that if something goes offline or need to be addressed, their short team takes forever to move the needle. That said, you can call and spend 20-30mins on the phone with a tech person to help.

I have a cash pay practice that i recently started. A patient bought a 6 visit package from me via HSA. 
I recieved this message from them. I have seen them for 4 visits so far. 

"Do you happen to have a more itemized receipt or a receipt that has the name of services provided? I tried to expense the one through received via email, the review team said my receipt had to have the name of specific service(s) on it."

I use Jane. 

Any info or input here would be very helpful and appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

For cash based PT: what, if any, codes are you adding to your invoice/superbill? 

Are you guys using CPT codes or just a flat rate regardless of what you do?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Mine have both ICD 10 and CPT codes with GP modifiers, otherwise insurance will deny them without a second glance (at least the standard ones BCBS, UHC, Cigna, Aetna etc) 

I split my cash charge by 4 for an hour appt and apply 1/4 charge per CPT code. They all get billed out the same per unit, but that’s the easiest way for me to do it so that there’s the most chance of insurance doing something with it for my patients.

> **Response 2:** Cpt codes on superbill to provide to client for potential reimbursement with insurance.

Also including ICD-10 on superbills.

My invoices only indicate that patient was made and serve as a receipt. Some patients require both for insurance reimbursement

I have been trying to understand network coverage of mobile PT practices and read this article. https://www.webpt.com/blog/how-to-document-and-bill-for-home-based-outpatient-pt-services

Pre-pandemic when I was beginning the process of starting a mobile practice  BCBS said they didn’t cover home based outpatient. 

It’s possible I didn’t ask the right question to the right person. 

My question for the group: anyone have experience in this specifically in Tennessee? What would be the RIGHT way to ask about this?

**Community Responses:**

Hi everyone. I'm a Texas provider here who is Cash only mobile clinic. 

A few questions as I'm still in the learning curve of being cash only and OON. One issue I have ran into is with patients who have BCBS

1. If a patient requests services, signs financial policy, and you provided a GFE.......do you courtsey verify auth if they request superbills prior to their sessions? Or do you leave it completely up to the patient to ask for auth from PCP and follow up on it to see if it's been approved or don't follow up and leave it up to the patient completely? 

2. If you saw a patient who did not require auth but a pre notification was needed to the insurance to inform them they were about to start  prior to therapy.....would you refund them all the $ they paid upfront, partial or none  as this was not completed and PT was aware they were going to ask for superbills? 

Being OON seems to be just as hard as being in network....or I'm bad at keeping business and heart felt sympathy for the patient's seperate. I am legally trying to know my rights and do what is ethically right as well.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are a lot of different ways to handle OON. For example I submit all bills to the insurance for the patient, take the insurance payment on assignment then balance bill the patient. 

Conversely I know ppl who take the entire upfront payment and leave all reimbursement to the pt. And absolutely don’t give refunds. 

In my opinion I believe that part of the appeal of OON to patients is a premium service. That includes not only treatment but customer service and administrative assistance. So we try to help our pts as much as we can.

> **Response 2:** I provide superbills only and collect payments at the time of service. When someone contacts me about starting treatment I tell them if they would like to be reimbursed they should call their insurance company to see what their OON benefits are, how to get reimbursed, if they need preauth, etc. Some do and some don’t. If they do require preauth I’ll call and/or fax what the insurance company wants but that’s it. I don’t give refunds.

Hi,

Can a patient submit a superbill to their secondary insurance for reimbursement if their primary is Medicare? Or is that something that would flag Medicare to look into us taking cash payment for physical therapy services. We do have our patients sign ABNs and ensure that they understand they are waiving their ability to submit to Medicare, but some are asking if they can submit to their secondary. Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are submitting to their secondary, they are submitting for reimbursement of skilled services...which u cant charge cash for,  for a Medicare Benificiary...as Jason Bloom said above.  ILLEGAL  be careful!  Also, secondary only pays after primary pays first...in this case, primary is never even billed

> **Response 2:** Yea that's super illegal...that's also not really what an ABN is for,so just be careful...

A little confused and seeking clarification for those who utilize insurance. 
For payers like BCBS, Humana, UHC, etc... do they only credential at the individual provider level, or do they credential group practices? 
Also, when seeking reimbursement - does this mean that billing goes thru the individual providers NPI, instead of the NPI of the group practice that employs them?
Medicare credentialing process went off without a hitch, but it seems like I am running into a few obstacles with commercial payers.

**Community Responses:**

For OON providers, taking insurance can someone clarify if we need to register/become contracted/credentialed with them?

Hey everyone. Can you enroll with a Medicare advantage provider without enrolling with their other commercial plans? IE, enroll in Medicare Plus Blue, but remain out of network with BCBS? Same for Humana, and Aetna, etc.
Also, how do I found out their reimbursement rates and any special considerations like pre auths prior to signing up with them?

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You would only need to enroll to be able to take the HMO plans and there are a few that require contracting. Most of the big ones provide out of network benefits

> **Response 2:** I am participating with Medicare. I've been getting a lot of calls from patients with one MA or another and figured I'd look into it. I have not done any OON billing so I have to figure out how to do that or become in network.

Trying to understand simple logistics.

 If you're an OON provider- do you come up with your price (ie for eval). If the patient agrees, they pay you the eval price up front (ie: $100). 
After treatment, you provide a superbill which the patient provides to his/her insurance. Depending on their plan coverage the insurance company then reimburses them. This could be nothing or what ever we charged via super bill?

Also, the superbill amount can be more or less than what you charged the patient (ie: $100)? 

Next as an OON provider- credentialing you or your business isn't needed?

 Also checks of benefits? Do any of you guys do that or leave it up to your patients?

Lastly, what kind of notes do you keep on hand as an OON? Similar to those as in network?

Thanks for reading and answering my questions. Trying to understand the game a lil better 🤣

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** the superbill can not be more than you charged the patient.  if they had reached their out of pocket max, the insurance company would refund all of it. (as long as charges are reasonable and customary)  charging more on your superbill than what u charged thebpatient, esp. in this scenario,  would constitute insurance fraud.  second point, documentarion is a state board requirement.  whether u are in or OON.(assuming care is skilled)..board requirementsdo not change for skilled care

> **Response 2:** I have my rates for all CPTs codes. So for an eval I charge $250 and the patient pays that at the time of service. I provide a superbill with the code, rate, what the patient paid. Then patient submits that to their insurance. If they have an OON Deductible it will get applied to that. Once that is met the insurance will reimburse them based on their fee schedule. 

Let’s say the insurance fee schedule for 97163 is $150. Each visit only $150 is applied to the deductible (even though the patient is paying me $250). Once met the patient has a 30% coinsurance. Insurance will reimburse the patient 70% of $150, so the total cost for the patient is 30% of $150 PLUS the $100 difference between the fee schedules. As the ONN provider is doesn’t matter because they already paid you $250. They should expect to only be reimbursed $105 (70% of $150) once deductible is met.

I have the patient contact their insurance to ask about their ONN benefits. I tried to do it and they would always give me the wrong info so I stopped.

If you tell patients you will give them a superbill for possible reimbursement you should make sure your documentation is detailed enough for insurances. Because they may require the patient to submit documentation. Also some plans require you to get prior auth even as OON. You don’t have to but then the patient won’t be reimbursed. Again I have the patient find all of that out first. 

I will also give the patient a W9 form to submit with the superbill if I’ve never had a patient with their insurance in the past.

A solo PT practice is interested in bringing on my LLC to work with them. We’re in Pennsylvania. She is OON for everyone but Medicare. I am an OT. For Medicare purposes, she would only be able to bill my OT services if she initially credentialed as a multi discipline clinic, is this correct? She wants me to apply for type 2 NPI but keep everything under her tax ID. I don't think this is possible, is it? I'd actually prefer to bill under her if there is a way (maybe my type 1 NPI?) as I'd like to keep my pelvic floor LLC solely cash based and don't want to deal with any insurances. Any insight appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on the state. In NY to bill under a discipline there must be a member of the LLC that is licensed in that discipline. This is just now starting to be enforced and some PT owned practices billing for OT service without an OT corporate member are in for a big surprise

I know this has been asked before but was wanting to bring this comparison up again as I’m sure each EMR has updates now. HelloNate or PtEverywhere?  I’m cash-based and now in-network with only BCBS. I’ve DMd a couple of people and thank you for the insight!

Currently with PtEverywhere and using an e-fax for an additional monthly cost. I wanted to see if HelloNote has been updated with an easier way to submit claims as PtEverywhere helps you generate a CMS-Form. Does HelloNote execute it better and more effeciently? Is it more cost-efficient than PTEverywhere? Thank in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HelloNote has a very good integration with Ability clearing house making it easy to submit claims.

> **Response 2:** I've been using HelloNote since 2020 and claims are very easy to submit.

Hey guys!

Have been in the group just kind of observing for a while. Appreciate all the information, hoping to someday get to where a lot of you all are! New to private practice and just in the beginning of my journey starting my biz. Was looking for clarification on laws/insurance guidelines, payment etc.

Do direct access laws, signed POC, progress notes, etc. only matter if billing insurance?

If you are billing insurance, is it a requirement to have referral, signed POC, 42 days direct access, CPT codes, etc? 

If you go beyond 90 days without signed POC, Or 42 days with direct access….Can you get in trouble? I guess my question is are these “laws” when practicing PT that you could be held accountable for braking or insurance payer guidelines. Any and all feedback is appreciated! TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should follow your state guidelines even if you are cash-based.
So, if your state requires a signed POC, etc, then yes.
If billing insurance, yes.
If you go beyond 90 days, will you get in trouble? Uncertain.  If it’s 100 days (10 days late)I’m going to guess probably not.  If it’s 200 days, who knows.  Chances are that you just might not get reimbursed. 
Will you lose your license for not meeting deadlines? That depends on if it’s WAY past deadlines AND consistently so.  But you would possibly just be put on a probation of sorts. 
If you miss one deadline, you won’t be thrown in jail and have your dog shot

> **Response 2:** I think it’s unlikely many people will answer this question with “facts” that if you get in trouble from doing the things they said, you could point to this person who said you can do it. You should probably ask a lawyer or find a law in your state that says you can or can’t to protect yourself.

I’m considering branching out to offer telehealth visits, mostly just for follow-ups or in-between regular in person visits. I’m curious to learn how to structure a telehealth visits, how you decide on pricing, are there different CPT codes for a superbill? 

On another note, I’m considering branching out to accept some insurance carriers that are popular in my area. I’d love to hear pros and cons from those who have done it. And how do you even learn where to start the credentialing process?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** as far as the insurance, get their fee schedule first.  some are easier to deal with..  others, like Aetna, cignaband uhc, are capitated and may not be worth it.

> **Response 2:** Same price, same CPT codes if you are billing insurance.  Be careful what insurances you sign up for and make sure that what they reimburse is actually worth your time

Hi, recently I have had a few home health patients ask if I can continue to do PT with them after they are discharged due to insurance not paying for more visits (Kaiser Medicare.) Is it legal for me to continue to see them but just charge them a cash rate? Would I need liability insurance?   Thanks.  Note: I work for a HH agency.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree with yes and yes but your employer may be your biggest barrier.  Many home health agencies would not allow this due to conflict of interest.

> **Response 2:** The PT Facebook group, most people said No, that they would have to exhaust ALL medicare benefits in order for me to legally see them.  🤔

  steady part time was about 2 months and full time 4 months (for 2 practitioners)  As far as convincing people to pay cash?, ask yourself, if u were the patient, what would a cash practice provide you  that you couldn't get at a clinic that accepts insurance.  what I would not want to hear is that the therapy/treatments are superior simply because the clinic/practitioner is OON.  talk to me about your skill set, experience, etc. and how they will help me achieve my goals.

Forgive me if this has been asked before, I used the search function and didn’t come up with anything…

If a patient uses their HSA to pay for cash services (OON PT) can they later provide a superbill to their insurance (CareFirst) to get some of that reimbursed without having pre-authorization? The CareFirst website and phone number are ZERO help for non-enrolled providers and my brain is exploding 🤯

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes because the insurance is going to re-imburse them for the covered parts.

If a therapist works as independent contractor for a home health agency and patient needs services after discharge from all med A services. Are you allowed to offer cash based tx or outpatient services if patient wants to continue services with same therapist? 

Does the therapist need LLC and separate NPI to provide any such service? 

What would be good reference to justify service with no conflict of interest? 

I am very new to uncaged part of the world and I am still in learning process. I would appreciate some guidance or pointers to right reference.

TIA

**Community Responses:**

Does therapeutic Activity have to be one on one and 15min?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No. You can bill a unit at 8 minutes. Medicare only pays for direct one on one care. That does not mean 8 minutes uninterrupted.  You have to consider the entire treatment time and adjust accordingly per Medicare guidelines

> **Response 2:** #Compliance #CPT97530 #TherapeuticActivities 

CPT® 97530

....By the book is correct: "Therapeutic activities, direct (one-on-one) patient contact (use of dynamic activities to improve functional performance), each 15 minutes"    

....edited: Per AMA time is achieved when the mid-point is passed. 

.....How time is calculated for the purpose of billing is a matter of payer policy.

Is it true that you cannot treat Medicare patients on a cash pased basis? Does anyone know how to get around this if so?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PTs cannot opt out of medicare so you can't charge a person with medicare cash for a service that medicare would cover. You can, with some stipulations, if they have a managed medicare plan as primary.

> **Response 2:** The workaround is to provide services that are non-covered services according to Medicare. Only if you are providing a service that are considered non-covered services then you can charge cash.

I'm sorry if this has already been discussed, but I've tried searching for the answer, resulting in pure confusion.  I'm registered as a Med B provider, but I want to submit my claims electronically.  

When filling out the EDI enrollment form it asks me for the network service vendor (NSV) and Billing Software Vendor. Here are my questions:
1. What is NSV?
1. Recommendations for NSV and Billing Software Vendor?
1. On the JL 5010 Approved Vendor List, what does Clearinghouse (CH) mean?

Thank you so much for your responses in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Faith Afriyie A NSV allows you to connect to your MAC. A clearing house is where your billing passes through when going out/coming back (EDI/ERA) to make sure the necessary data is completed. an example of a common clearing house is Office Ally. 

I don’t recall needing to complete info related to an NSV. I believe that the NSV would be what your clearing house chooses to use. Might be MAC/location dependent.

In Massachusetts we complete the info provided from office ally into our Medicare MAC site (NGS).

Insurance Question: I have a patient with Aetna Medicare and Medicaid dual plan. On availity it says she needs a prior Authorization. So I evaluate the patient and send the prior authorization request on availity and it says Further Medical Review Required. What are my chance to get the Authorization prior to my second visit? Also, if it requires Authorization will I get paid for the evaluation or not? Please guide.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My experience- eval doesn’t need prior authorization and they will pay. We don’t go out on the second visit or any further visits until we receive authorization. You can follow up with them via phone.

> **Response 2:** From my experience obtaining authorizations, they may not retro authorize. Unless your Eval date is stated as the effective date (first day of the auth period) they may reject it
But you need to have evaluated them before you can request the auth so that you can accurately provide the diagnosis and CPT codes and projected number of visits/sessions 
I have started charging the self pay rate for the Initial assessment then I call to request the auth and include the date from when I call so that the followup sessions are covered, then I balance bill the patient after the sessions process through the insurance

I've had a Medicare question posed to me. In outpatient, for Medicare patients, per Medicare, does the supervising OT have to be in the building when the OTA is treating? Did that loosen for Covid and now will revert back for 2023?
I remember some weird supervision thing but I thought that was supervision of students treating Medicare patients.
(apologies, I may cross post in other groups )

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No, only the supervising PT.  It also depends on the state practice act

Hey everyone,
I live in an area with lots of development going on. Palm Beach County, FL.  I have a mobile PT/OT practice with a brick and mortar clinic as well. I’m coming up with some new non-insurance based ideas and wanted to see who’s done this already….

New, large office buildings are going up or recently went up all around me with high end executives coming down from NY.  I’d like to offer some kind of “executive ergo” program including work site recommendations (home and office) and ergo break stretches…. Maybe individualized stretching programs for those in need. Perhaps videos or links to videos as part of a package.  I’m not an ergo specialist and I don’t want to be the one providing the services. I want to develop the program and have an PT or OT with the certification run it.

Anyone already doing this that would be willing to consult with me?

**Community Responses:**

Any other Floridians doing mobile/cash based? I know the practice act requires rx after 30 days but how do you tend to go about that? I do pelvic, so especially if they were referred by Licensed nurse midwife or doula? Just looking for clarity on how hard and fast that 30 days is, is it only relevant with insurance based, or if there are l👀pholes…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There's some verbiage in the FL practice act regarding being able to treat if the condition was previously assessed by the physician, but honestly after reading it myself I decided that it's a safer option to just get something in writing.  It may be a good idea to take a look at the practice act and get your own impression of that portion of it.  

The 30 day rule wouldn't be impacted by cash vs. insurance.

Has anyone obtained a business license to be able to sell retail at their clinic?  It would be extremely helpful for some of my patients and clients to have the items available in person.  I would love to know what issues anyone has had?

Note: I only plan to have 20 or less items at a time.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your normal business license generally covers that but you will need to update the information.  This is so state specific.  You will need to be able to calculate and then record and pay sales taxes. Next depends on the items.

> **Response 2:** Check your state and county rules for sales tax. I have to pay quarterly on my sales taxable stuff (product only not services thankfully).

**Community Responses:**

Maybe the foster care has a non profit?

Is there a range (percentage) that patients can expect to get reimbursed from a superbill?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on many factors. Deductible, OON benefits (copay/coinsurance), limiting charges, etc

Generally as a sweeping statement there is no way to just say “expect this %” for everyone.

> **Response 2:** Depends on their coverage. Varies greatly. Can be literally anywhere from 0-100% depending on if they have hit their deductible.

Hi everyone! Hopefully someone can help me answer this! I’ve been seeing a pt for HHPT who pays Medicare cash for these visits. He wants to continue HHPT and sounds like he wants to put me on payroll directly and not go through Medicare. But he wants to pay me and give me a 1099 form. Is this something I can do ? Or is there a safe way to go about this legally? Thanks  in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should be claiming all income on your taxes. So if he gives you a 1099 it’s just his way of claiming what he had paid you in IRS term. I’m no accountant though. So I would run it by a professional.

> **Response 2:** #Compliance - the way the question is phrased, there is no way to given an accurate answer.

I own a hybrid practice. For those who accept insurance and use a biller, does your biller charge a percentage on the payments of clients who are paying towards a deductible?

My previous biller saw these as self pay (seems like they are), but my current biller takes a percentage.  What is the biller having to do to the claims to necessitate taking a percentage?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** From a billers perspective, if that claim is denied or rejected, there is no deductible to collect on. I've spent hours on claims just to have it be processed to the deductible. We can't work for free 🤷‍♀️

> **Response 2:** They are still sending it to insurance but it doesn’t take anymore effort than a copay/coinsurance visit.

Hi y’all,
Wondering what codes people use if they’re billing for wheelchair evaluations? Do people use the 97755 code? I’ve always billed it under 97530 thinking it’s kind of like patient education/equipment recommendation, but did some research and found this code.  Can both PTs and OTs bill this code or is it discipline specific?  

I’ve gotten some referrals for wc evaluations but then found out later they were getting outpatient therapy somewhere else, and just needed me for the wc evaluation bc I’m mobile and can come to them.  I know that insurance doesn’t like to see the same codes or diagnostic codes being used for different companies and claims, so I’m just trying to see if using a more specific cot code may prevent me from getting denials. 

If anyone has any info or experience I’d love to hear it!  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No discipline owns any codes. If it’s in your scope of practice you can bill it. 97755 would be for more advanced power wheelchair switches, environmental or voice controls through the chair electronics, etc. 97542 is what I have always seen used in seating clinics for evaluation and follow up visits.

I am starting a mobile-out of network practice and want to continue to be an upstanding business owner.  
I am wondering about insurance billing and Medicare compliance in regards to this:   does anyone hold "office hours" at a physician-owned site and see patients there, like once/month?  Is it part of the MD office visit and MD bills the patient or something else?    But continue your mobile-cash based practice on the side which does not take insurance and will not be involved with Medicare?   
There is some uneasiness legal/compliance feeling here with this scenario that I am not sure about.   Thank you for feedback.

I need advice on OON billing. I am new to this and I have a potential patient wanting to start physical therapy with me. I called his insurance and verified his benefits. 30 visits/year, no co-insurance, and no auth required. However, he has contributed $0 to his OON deductible. I gave him my cash pay rates and he’s willing to pay cash. 

My question now is do I still bill his insurance so it applies to his deductible? If so, do I have to bill their OON reimbursement flat rate or my own rate? TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you have an EMR this is/should be quite easy.  
Put in the codes for DXand treatment codes like you would for anyone else.  
Select “no” on accept assignment. and also put the price the patient has paid to you. And just submit to insurance as your normally would.  Aka courtesy billing.

> **Response 2:** That really sounds like In Network benefits.  You can still submit to insurance but only for the amount u charged him.  The ins. Co. Will need the cost broken down into different CPT codes.  At my clinic, we bill OON as mentioned above or a flat cash rate with no CPT codes and no OON billing.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes.  There is a process but I would work with a local DME company that you trust. This is a great time to develop these relationships. The other question is what does Medicare cover. I made a brief video on this but frankly understand the basics and then work with a DME company as they have to have it all figured out if they are wanting to get paid and keep up with how it gets covered. If it is not covered then you provide your clients with options.

Hello everyone! With the business starting to grow I'm in the market for a CPA but honestly have no idea where to start. I've searched a couple of groups and through Google but still feel lost. Estimated taxes are coming up and I'd like to have some help with these as well as future taxes down the line. How did you all go about finding a good CPA for your business? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same as above. I found mine because another small business owner friend had been using them for years and highly recommended.

One that's really familiar with small business owners would be a good consideration. If you use Profit First, it's nice if they understand what that is because it makes things less confusing (mine has no idea what it is, so there are lots of back and forth clarification questions).

> **Response 2:** Speak to some other small business owners in your area. That's how we found ours.

Newly uncaged- with newbie questions 
Starting off cash based /Medicare B (still waiting on contract, but I've sent it all in). Do you ask all the patients for insurance info on intake to know if someone has medicare? I also offer wellness services and will need to know if I need them to sign an ABN.  

Do they sign an ABN using Jane App?

 Can someone walk me through checking someone's medicare insurance info/eligibility/active status/caps before their PT eval? Do you check it on PECOS? Will it tell me if they are getting home services or on hospice? 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You usually can check eligibility on your MACs website that’s how I do it-it will tell you if the patient has an open spell of home health and/or an advantage plan and not original Medicare. ABNs are used when you think it’s not going to be paid by Medicare-Medicare has never covered wellness so I don’t have the ABN for wellness as that was never covered.

I’m currently a cash practice only but may add blue cross. Who do you recommend and trust? I am open to suggestions about doing it on my own as well

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

They have a lot of great features in billing - especially, text/email statements, credit card on file, an eWallet to pay over and just apply to future dates, etc.

Thanks for any help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I guess it's different for every state, I've been doing it for 25 years. I have contract with early intervention, insurance companies and medicaid. Some of medicaid hmo pays full amount of state rate and some don't. But the demand is super high and there is definitely shortage of therapists.

Has anyone had success getting Cigna to pay out-of-network claims based on UCR (Usual and Customary Rates) instead of the deeply discounted rates from Data iSight?

I recently submitted claims as an out-of-network physical therapist, and the reimbursement was shockingly low — as if I were in-network. After digging, I found that Cigna uses Data iSight to reprice OON claims, often ignoring Fair Health/UCR benchmarks.

💬 If you’ve successfully appealed or negotiated better reimbursement:
 • What worked?
 • Did you opt out of Data iSight?
 • Who did you contact — provider services, employer group, or appeal unit?
 • Any sample letters or strategy tips would be deeply appreciated.

Let’s help each other fight back against unfair repricing. Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom! 🙌

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got paid a decent amount from Cigna

> **Response 2:** It’s very easy to negotiate those claims. Did you call the number on the EOB?

I provided a Superbill to a patient with all of the numbers (EIN, NPI, NPI 2, diagnosis codes, billing codes and fees) and it was denied on the basis of a missing “sales tax number”. I’m in Florida and PT services are not subject to sales tax so that’s a number I don’t have. Has anyone run into this or have any ideas?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had to add a sales tax number when I started selling goods in addition to services, but not due to insurance requiring it. Might be worth a call to the insurance company to see if it’s a mistake.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes I have heard this from several sources but I’m curious what everyone on here will say. I don’t have a solid resource or legal precedence on it- just what I was taught. 

My understanding is that if they have insurance and the medical provider is in network for that insurance and it is a covered service, then you have to go through insurance. 

Most MD offices follow this as well.

> **Response 2:** Patients can choose to use their insurance if they want, or choose to not use it. Their choice, totally ( if commercial plan of course)

Experiences with BCBS? I am in SC. When I was in network (in 2022) they were the best payers and easier to work with. Never had to request pre-auth, never got a letter requesting anything… they paid within few weeks of claim. 
So I recently decided to go back in network, and a couple people was talking about how hard to deal they are now. is this really the case or maybe just state specific???

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in SC and haven’t had any trouble billing for ST, but the reimbursement for the speech code is ridiculously low.

Hi ya’ll. Thought to ask here so please chime in. Remember when Covid happened and we learned of a code for practice expenses?  I believe it is a non covered service now.    
And here is the But… our practice expenses have gone up soo much and insurances are still cutting patments. 
I want to bill people directly for practice expense. There are CPT code for practice expenses related to pelvic health supplies, -99459, several others such as 99072 and another for Unlisted Supplies and Materials (CPT® Code 99070). And most are charging for supplies for dry needling already. 
It seems like to me we can charge people for this rise in practice expenses. Has any one took a dive into this to bill patients for?

I have a cash based mobile vestibular practice. My patient reached out to his insurance company asking about out of network benefits. He will be requesting a superbill and gave me the list of requirements needed on it. I have most of them on my bill but hadn’t heard of a “Place of Service Code.” Can someone share what that is? I will be treating him at home tomorrow but may also meet him at his workplace if need be in the future. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Place of Service codes are exactly as they sound, codes to signify where you are performing the treatment.  POS 12 is for home whereas your typical clinic POS is 11. I'm not sure if it would be different for their office,  but you may want to have them verify with their insurance that POS 12 will allow reimbursement.

I bill primarily Med B . I have someone wanting me to see their family member on a cash basis.  He is on hospice and does not have Medicare.  This will be my first cash client . Do I need to have signed orders? I am in a direct access state. What kind of paperwork should I have them sign?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Must have the GFE

> **Response 2:** You don't need orders. I would have them sign a consent to treat, a form stating they received your HIPPA privacy notice, a communication preferences form (how you may contact them & ROI if relevant), and a payment agreement form explicitly stating your rates & when payment is expected.

I am cash based and work 4 days per week. On my off day I have covered at my old job a few times a year when the owner is down a PT and needed evals. I haven't renewed my credentials with medicare from when I was employed, he is asking if I want to renew with him. If I don't another PT can co-sign but it is more hassle for them. Is there any reason I shouldn't? Is there any reason I should?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No not to renew. And cosigning is a questionable practice.

> **Response 2:** Co-sign = submitting claim. Fact. Coding not issue, submitting claim is the issue. GoToTheSource

Planning to start my own mobile PT business in Kansas, being in network with Medicare for Med B patients and then cash based for the rest of patients. Trying to decide on which EMR system to use..thinking I want the EMR system to do my billing for me to save me time but I know that can get costly. Any recommendations on which EMR systems you love (or reasons you don’t like a certain EMR) would be greatly appreciated! And if your EMR doesn’t do billing, who do you use for your billing?
Thanks in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Medicare part B is pretty easy billing. May be worth billing direct through your MAC, esp if they have a provider portal.

I use HelloNote which integrates with Inovalon. Pretty simple process.

> **Response 2:** Check out JaneApp

Someone shared a great video on the pros/cons of traditional Medicare vs Advantage plans, and I'm wondering if it was in this group. 
I met with my own health insurance rep and we discussed this. My rep is eager to understand how this really works for patients from a different perspective, and I'd really like to share the video I saw. Can someone point me in the right direction? I'm remembering a therapist sitting on the floor, explaining it with drawings...maybe on a white board. Thanks! Helping educate those that sell these policies seems pretty darn important!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you go with an advantage plan when first applying for Medicare you will not be guaranteed a supplement if you change your mind. You will need underwriting. Also, advantage plans advertise no premiums because Medicare pays them $1000. This is all coming from an insurance broker of 40+ yrs

> **Response 2:** I don't know of such a video but if you are in different States throughout the year, like having a vacation home, you want traditional Medicare. Many Advantage plans are Regional based.

Superbill question: I have Jane (cash version not insurance) so I put a note in each receipt when patients request with dx and cpt codes etc. I have a patient with Aetna and she was told the dx code was wrong but won’t tell her which code is wrong (she has several dx) and want to talk to me. They allegedly tried calling me (I was on vacation so I did not answer and they left no voicemail). she gave me a number to call, against my better judgement I tried calling in her behalf but it went to a voicemail saying something about collections so I did not leave a message. Patient wants to try calling Aetna when I am available to be called so we can try to streamline the process, but shouldn’t the insurance company just tell her exactly what needs to be corrected?? Why do they HAVE to talk to me? Any advice on this, other than telling the patient to figure it out on her own?

Hi Everyone!
I was wondering if anyone had experience with HCFA forms? We have two patients who were in a car accident and the insurance company (travelers) is paying for their appointments. From a quick search it looks like HCFA is now called CMS 1500. We are not participating with medicare/medicaid so I just want to make sure we aren't doing anything wrong. 

Also, if anyone has done these forms before, what is the reimbursement like? Is it worth it?

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It depends on the insurance for reimbursement but yes you can use the CMS 1500 forms. It can be anywhere from $120-$300/visit depending on units billed and what they reimburse

Hey!

I am providing a private, cash pay patient with a superbill to submit to her insurance under OON benefits.

Can anyone provide insight on what PT codes can be billed together? I now know you cant bill two of the same codes without a 59 modifier, so I want to avoid another coding mistake and hopefully get it right on the first round. The patient is R ankle pain ICD10.
If I bill 4 codes, one of each: manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, neuro re-ed and therapeutic activities is that okay? or gait training instead of one of the above works too. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** One of the benefits of being cash base is that you don't have to worry about this headache. Bill the CPT codes you performed and provide the superbill. As an OON provider you have no commitment to play by insurance rules and can treat as such. GP modifier CPT codes for therapists can be used.

Hey all, I have a question regarding super bill codes for in-home outpatient therapy. Apparently my patient's insurance has been reimbursing for "home health." I'm not sure if this is because I used Point of Service code 12 for "home." Is there a different type of coding I should use to indicate to the insurance company that this is outpatient therapy that happens to be taking place in the home (or should I just omit the POS code all together)? I really value this client and want to help him get the proper reimbursement from his insurance co. TIA for any help, guidance, or direction you can provide!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** POS 11 = Office. Some carriers only see 12 as HH. They advise to use 11 as mobile many times. You just need to ask not using "mobile" or "home". POS 12 PT. They need to look it up actually typing in the codes to see if covered. Otherwise they assume.

> **Response 2:** I use code 12 for my billing for outpatient in the home. I think it depends on the insurance company, I would call the company or have the patient call the claims different and see if you can get an answer. Hope that helps.

I feel like I may already know the answer to this question but I just want to make sure. 

In most states there is direct access which allows someone to do PT for 90 days before needing a physician order. 

If I'm billing purely cash based for my services and don't do super bills am I still limited to 90 days?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In Michigan it’s 21 days or 10 visits unless it’s wellness services. As far as I understand it is not related to whether or not you are using insurance however just the opposite some insurers will require a script.

> **Response 2:** You always have to follow your state’s practice act. It’s not about reimbursement it’s about safety, maintaining your license in good standing, and CYOA 🙂

Hi! We are Medicare Part B provider. There is a home care agency who is referring a pt, but has commercial insurance. The agency suggest we apply for single case agreement (we are out of network). But when I look at the referral, it is In-patient home health (PT/RN/HHA). They're asking if we can provide the PT services. Given that this is commercial insurance, can I provide home visit even if we're not Part A provider? Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe what they are suggesting is that you contract for them. You would be seeing the patient, they would be billing insurance and pay you whatever is agreed upon. They likely don't have anyone available to see the patient.

> **Response 2:** ￼ Is the patient getting any other services from the agency? ￼ What kind of insurance do they have? We have had situations like this, but as in many cases, it depends on many different factors.

**Original Post:**
I've asked this before but never got a clear answer so here it is again:
If seeing a patient multiple times in a week (or month), can you combine all visits into 1 superbill, or should there be a separate superbill for each visit?

I currently provide my patients with a bill after each visit, but it would be easier to combine 3 or 4 visits at a time.

If so, what would the superbill look l Iike? If anyone is willing to send me a screenshot of a superbill made for multiple visits I'd appreciate it! (Of course without patient information on there...)

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. 

The units should all go on the CMS-1500 with their respective dates of service. Can have multiple/many.

I will often bill multiple patient visits at the same time and my billing software automatically combines these dates of service onto the same form.

> **Response 2:** I do mine separate per visit. I believe that if a patient is submitting them to insurance by themselves; they have to input one by one based on visit date….

Trying to get verification for PTs to dry needle in PA. I realize the state currently has “no opinion” and this it is not covered/reimbursed by insurance but is it legal to do it as a cash-based service to patients as a PT if I first obtain a business license, have them sign waiver?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Legality does not change based on who is paying (cash vs insurance)

> **Response 2:** Do it until someone tells you no.

Anyone work with or employ ATCs? 

My husband is one and a fantastic S&C coach at that. He coaches high school football, so has access to a whole plethora of potential patients. I’d love to utilize him when working with athletes, especially as they’re preparing to return to sport. I opened a hybrid clinic about 4 months ago that is doing really well. My schedule is full 1-2 weeks out and my PTA’s is as well. 80% of our patients are insurance based. 

Would love to hear how you’re employing allied health professionals in your practice.

**Community Responses:**

For those of you who started out with a small side hustle of 1 to 2 clients outside of your main job that involves insurance reimbursement and automatic take out of funds for taxes, how did you deal with taxes?  Both of these clients mainly pay me cash and sometimes pay via check.  Is there a threshold amount that you don't have to worry about taxes until you reach that threshold?  Do you always have to deal with taxes even if what you make is just a small amount on the side?

**Aetna** - we have discovered Aetna will only pay for an evaluation code every 180 days. While they'll still pay all other codes, if you evaluate someone, discharge and then want to pick them up for therapy again within that 180 days we will not be reimbursed for the evaluation code.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yep. When verifying benefits ask if there are limitations to eval code. A few more insurances are like that as well.

When checking for copays how do you guys confirm the actual copay? We have had a number of patients where it says one thing on availity or something different when we actually call their insurance. Then when we get the EOB back the price is different so we end up owing the patient back some money. How best to minimize this? I don’t want patients to think bad of us for this happening. Because we try to check every avenue we can and we still sometimes are not sure.

Question on billing Medicare for part B services. If you are enrolled to accept Medicare, do you also need to be credentialed with a patient’s supplemental insurance to accept the 20% remaining that would be picked up by that provider, or does happen automatically thru Medicare?  Wondering if it’s worth credentialing outside of Medicare.  Also is there a difference in supplemental vs secondary insurance or is this the same term.    If different, what percentage would you guess do people have secondary vs supplemental.  Just trying to understand how all of this works. 

Other separate note. Do you all use a billing company separate from what is built into an EMR system?   What do they provide for you and do you find it necessary?  If valuable do you have recommendations?  Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If a patient has a Medicare supplement, it automatically rolls over to that supplement provider. We use a separate billing company from our EMR & we absolutely LOVE them. They check benefits for me before seeing a patient, bill all insurances & answer my relentless questions anytime there are changes with Medicare. I’m in NC, they’re out of NJ. I would HIGHLY recommend them! The name of the company is GTA electronic billing solutions. Their number is 973-616-7111. Grace is the owner.

Greetings to all my fellow "UNCAGED CLINICIANS"

I am an Occupational Therapist who started Prism Health Services, LLC ~12 years ago, in an attempt to break away from Insurance driven(dictated) and poor quality medical equipment/products being forced onto the clients at home. We (my husband supported me in my endeavor) supply good/ high quality, functional products especially in home health area.  We  also supply to small ALF.

We are available for consultations for all types of cases and we have the capability of shipping all over the country...

We don't accept insurance simply because insurance don't pay for most of the higher quality products we supply which MAKE LIFE EASIER for the patients and their families/caregivers. 
For some products insurance do cover, our prices have been much affordable directly as opposed to going thru insurance (Especially if you consider the amount of time taken needed to do the voluminous documentation/ meet the requirements towards reimbursement!)

If anyone in this group would like know more please reach out to us at 904-880-9900 ext. 12.

I am happy to post some of the testimonials (volunteered - not paid) by my happy & satisfied clients (patients as well as caregivers)... if that is allowed in this group. I don't want to break any rules of this group. 🙏🙏

Just wanted to share what an UNCAGED CLINICIAN is doing different & unique! 🙏🙏

Happy Independence Day to all!!
🙏🙏👍🇺🇸🙏🙏

For those who are in network with Medicare with a brick and mortar facility: 
I am considering the possibility credentialing with Medicare, but my clinic has stairs. There is nothing I can do about this—there is no elevator and no possibility of putting in a ramp. Everything else in my facility is ADA compliant. Is there any workaround for being in an older building with stairs or should I just forget the idea of credentialing since I can’t change the stair situation?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I worked at a clinic with stairs.  The owners installed a chair lift.  Is this a possibility for you?

If my patient changes insurance companies (ie from Anthem to Aetna). When I bill the new insurance for the first time do I need to do or submit an evaluation? I’m not planning to re-evaluating the patient unless I need to, as there was no break in care, they just changed jobs. But I wasn’t sure if say Aetna would ask why I am treating someone without evaluating them first, because it would be a new case to them.

Starting out cash based in California. I know there are Medicare laws about accepting cash, but does anyone know if there are laws regarding this with Medi-cal/Medicaid or with CCS? Having a hard time finding anything in my research. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe medi-cal follows Medicare general guidelines for services. But if. cCS family we’re seeing you for wellness services then you would probably be fine. Also consider not all CCS families are medical-cal. CCS as a program is based on medical necessity not insurance, so some families might have other insurance funding but still be eligible for CCS.

Just gathering info as I am in the early phases of starting my own mobile PT cash/Medicare practice. If I am participating provider with Medicare, but a patient has a supplement or Medicare replacement plan :

1) How do I go about billing the secondary if I am not contracted with any other insurances? Does the patient pay this or do I submit on their behalf as OON provider?
2) In the case of Medicare replacement/advantage plans, am I required to accept these when contracted with Medicare?
3) Also, what are the best resources for how to learn to bill Medicare independently or worth the investment of using a billing company ?

Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** From what I’ve learned: 1. I think the secondary automatically kicks in
2. Medicare advantage plans are their own thing, you’ll probably be billing OON with them. Any questions have to be directed to the insurance provider i.e. Aetna, Cigna, United
3. Anthony Maritato’s course has been recommended to me like 8 times now lol. Zero to paid. I’ll be taking it once I’m ready to enroll with Medicare. 

Someone chime in and make sure I’m giving correct info!

Professional and General Liability Insurance article
I was reading a post yesterday and noticed an answer about Liability Insurance from David Russak. I went and checked out his blog about this and I have to say, this is probably one of the best consolidations of info on the topic I've seen. 5 years ago, my business insurance broker saved me a ton of money but as we've scaled in size and especially since Covid, the rates are skyrocketing. 
Thanks David! This article gives me a great reason to go shopping.

For those using Spry and you are pleased, would you put your clinic name in the comments? I need to know that the ones commenting are business owners. How is the verification of benefits going for you? They use an automated online check and then if more info is needed they use AI. The only way I can get accurate information is to call the insurance company. This seems especially essential in order to determine if the deductible applies or not, if authorization is needed or not and if a referral on file is required. I do not see how this very important part of collecting correct information to protect my clinic from denials and to let the client know session costs would work with Spry.

Hello all,

Beginning work as an independent contractor that has me enrolled in Medicare. I’m also starting my own mobile PT company, where I plan to be OON with commercial payors and only accept cash from individuals with Medicare through an ABN (where appropriate of course). I’m looking for some guidance on setting my fee schedule as someone enrolled in Medicare only accepting cash. 

I’ve gone through and found the non facility limiting charges for my area (DC/MD suburbs), and it seems like the max I can charge for and eval will be $175-$200 and for follow ups will be $125. 

Does this seem right?? And if you set a fee schedule, it should apply to everyone the same, meaning insurance coverage should not affect charge?

Thanks!

I am in CT and will be subleasing an office from a local gym to run my PT LLC. I have been a member at that gym for 3 years now and became good friends with the owners. They asked me whether I would want to teach a few group fitness classes, which I would like. 

1. Would I be operating under my PT license? In CT PT includes wellness care. And do I have to get separate insurance policy?

2. I am going to be cash based. If CT practice act includes wellness care, can I still see Medicare patients or technically not since their wellness care might be covered by insurance run PT clinic?

I am waiting on Medicare credentialing to go through and wondering if I can see a federal BCBS patient who has that as primary and MC as secondary without billing MC since I can’t yet. Anyone have clarification on this? I am credentialed with BcBS.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think you should be able to. You may bill Medicare at a later date when you have your approval. It is harder to bill Medicare as secondary. They would be asking for your EOB from BCBS. I had this scenario about 10 years ago. It was hard since we were doing our own billing before. Check BCBS eligibility. Make sure you get paid by them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a firm believer that Medicare does not care one bit if you save them money. Just make sure you and the patient are on the same page that Medicare won’t cover, and get an ABN. If you document, document that the patient is already functional and PT is “not medically necessary” if you want extra assurance.

Happy Friday :)
If anyone can help, I have a couple questions regarding a patient with Humana PPO as an out of network provider:
1. Cohere says no auth is required for the initial evaluation, am I only able to bill the 97161 eval code for this visit?
2. I checked availity and the patient still has a significant amount owed towards their OON deductible, will I not be paid by Humana until this deductible is met?
3. How do I determine if the patient has a copay?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I check eligibility on availity. Most likely out of network deductible needs to be met before anything will be paid out, if there is a limit of visits you'll probably never get paid and all the visits will run out. You can offer for your patient to pay upfront and bill for them or they can submit it to insurance on their own

Hi everyone who works with worker's comp case, welcome your feedback: with worker's comp, which billing rule should I follow? AMA guideline so I can bill 8 min/unit (eg: 24 min for 3 unit) or should I use Medicare rule like 40 min for 3 units? 
General speaking, is that true the State worker's comp insurance company usually pay less and has less room to negotiate rate? Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Every state has set work comp rates , usually paid at 100%. Look em up and see for yourself. It's the third party payers (medrisk, onecall)  that try to give you a percentage 70% ,60% or flat rates.

> **Response 1:** There are good resources out there and this group as well as Physical Therapy Billing. But it’s one of those things that you just learn as you go. Every insurance is different. We started billing OON besides from Medicare at the beginning of this year and I’d say no preparation would prepare me.

Hello Group,
I have a patient who underwent Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty about a year ago under BWC. He had therapy with Home Health under BWC for up to 7 months. Now he wants me to start His Mobile O/P PT for that shoulder strengthening. I am not contracted with BWC but I am contracted with his primary health insurance. Can I see him under his Insurance or I should not see him as I am not contracted with BWC? 

Please guide.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is likely still an open BWC claim. That will need to be established.

Thoughts as I'm answering questions to get a liability insurance quote?
1. "Do you accept patients only with a written plan of treatment from an attending physician? If not, please explain."

I'm thinking I'll explain that the physician doesn't write the plan of treatment... I have only worked in schools for the last several years and don't remember the process. I'm in Utah which AOTA lists as not requiring a referral for OT, though our state practice act doesn't explicitly make a statement about this. If I'm understanding correctly, Medicaid requires a physician prescription for OT in Utah, but I plan to start cash-based. Before scheduling an appointment, I require a dr to sign that there are no contraindications or precautions for incorporating horses as part of occupational therapy. Is there reason to send the doctor the eval, plan, or anything else?

2. Are you approved to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments?

I haven’t sought this yet under my own business. I have planned on starting out as only receiving cash/health savings accounts/FSAs and may decide to become in-network with medical insurance later.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HPSO never asked those questions....

If so, how would I do that?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should be able to work for or in  both
Working with someone- you are the treating provider but not the billing provider so they bill under their group NPI.
In your own practice- you are the billing and treating provider, billing under your practice NPI.

But has since had a fall, surgery , acute rehab, and moved from her home to a private luxury senior apartment with full-time care all out-of-pocket. Do I need to do anything if the family wants to switch back to Medicare as primary? Does anyone know how to help my friend deal with this for her mom?

I'm having problems with BCBS
With reimbursing patients as they want to use my type 1 NPI....which apparently is associated with another companies EIN. I work part time with that company.  They keep calling to have me add their tax ID  to my superbill- rather than the one that was assigned with my type 2 for my cash clinic. Help please! 

Currently, on my superbill I have my individual npi and my type 2 with the EIN associated with my type 2. And they can't process the claims. 

I have submitted a w9 via email they provided back in July but have not heard back. Do I need to apply to be an OON provider in addition to supplying a superbill?

You can complete the business application and then hold claims until approval. The start date should go back to the date you completed the application.

Billing question. I have a client submitting their superbill....claims are being denied for them not having my tax ID match my provider #.  So, I called and they provided me with my tax ID number to put on my superbill...however, the TID # was not my tax ID. As it's the TID of my other employer rather than my business. Long story short.   I live in Texas, I have my EIN on my super bill along with my individual and type 2 npi. When they type in my type 2... apparently they said they can't find it. I am OON and I figured as much. But idk if I am suppose to feel out paperwork with the insurance to recognize me as an OON provider. Help! 

The provider number was no help or claims dept. How can I make sure that things are more efficient on patient ends in the future?

Hi all, hope you all are having a great week. 
 Couple of randoms:
1. As I understand it, Medicare law does not allow non-participating providers to charge cash to Medicare recipients for medically necessary care.  To anyone's knowledge, does this apply to beneficiaries who are on Medicare due to disability and NOT 65+ yo?  Yes?  Maybe - plan dependent?  Worth a call to Medicare?
1. I have a client looking for a great portable/home cold laser device for pain/nerve pain, ideally made in the USA and under $1000.  Any good leads out there?
1. THANKS!

Does anyone know if insurance ever takes money back from patients? If a patient has submitted with a super bill and gotten reimbursed by insurance, does insurance ever take the money back from them?

I know they take it back from providers even after they have paid,  but was curious about patients.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes they do, but it’s more likely that the insurer will reduce future benefits by the amount they paid in error.

An insurance company sent me 5 checks instead of sending them to the patient I treated months ago and who paid me cash. The insurance company never picked up my phone call so I opted to contact the patient and issue a reimbursement to her. Then I deposited the checks. Yesterday I received a letter saying she has used up her authorization. I am no longer treating her so shrugged it off. Today my bank sent me a letter saying the 5 checks are charged back…contact the issuer. So, is this worth fighting? Any recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Fight it. Contact the insurance company. If they try and give you grief contact your state’s insurance administration to file a complaint. Just saying that might be enough to get them to pay.

Hello Group! I have a question...I have a patient we are currently seeing for cash based PT services. She is turning 65 this month and is wanting to get Medicare Part A but not Part B as she is still working and wants to keep her insurance. Am I still allowed to see her for cash since she won't be a Medicare Part B beneficiary?

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just something for your patient to be aware of.  I had a friend decline setting up med B and she ended up having to pay some penalties for not setting it up at 65.  Don’t have specific details but may want  to ask.

My questions:

2.  What codes are you frequently using together? 
3  Can you bill for 1 unit of 97507 with 1 unit of 92526?

Do not EVER sign a contract with OptimisPT for you EMR. They offer the most offensive customer service experience you will ever experience.  They will advertise "you wont receive a bill for the first two months!", but in reality that means the first bill you pay at month 3 is actually for month 1... so it's a scam set up to make you keep paying long after you told them you would be switching services to another EMR. To leave them has cost me $1200 and they are asking for another $600 for two more months of "usage" even though there hasn't been any.

**Original Post:**
Hello!  I've got a billing question I need some help with if anyone has some advice for me!  I have a brick and mortar Pediatric Occupational Therapy clinic, but one of my families who I have known for years asked me to do a second session at their home to work on ADLs with my client. I changed the location to "home" on my insurance claim for the home sessions, and keep his clinic session as "office" on the claim.  The home claim went through and was reimbursed without any trouble, but I wanted to be sure this is correct?

I am curious and second guessing this because my friend owns an in-home SLP business, and she says she keeps the billing as "office", even when she is working in clients homes.  Is this different for SLP vs OT? I figured since my location of service was different, I should be sure to change it on the claim?

I really appreciate any advice, I want to make sure I'm billing appropriately and ethically! Thank you!

**Original Post:**
I’m in the very early stages of considering my own mobile practice.  I realize I will need to be credentialed with Medicare B, but otherwise I want as little to do with insurance as possible.  I spent the first 10 years as a PT primarily in outpatient ortho/sports rehab…SHM for 6 years…then returned working in pediatrics for the past 4 years.  I had my OCS, and now I’m working on PCS.  I love it all!…and I would love to offer services to everyone- from newborn to elderly….(but I have read a lot about the importance of finding a niche/specializing)…Would there be any downsides/barriers to this kind of business plan?

If someone is admitted to home hospice can I still provide them a super bill to submit to insurance? I believe they have a BCBS Texas plan as primary insurance. But he’s also a firefighter who is receiving pay/possibly benefits from New York and his local FD for being first responder to the 9/11 attacks. I’m BRAND NEW with all this so these are confusing topics for me lol. They want to do private pay once a week to keep him moving. Prior patient of mine that I was seeing with HH before he went to the hospital and went hospice.

**Original Post:**
Hi! 

I wanted to request clarification regarding our recent Medicare claim denials.

1. We submitted all claims through Office Ally after completing EDI enrollment for Medicare Part B. However, we recently received a Medicare Remittance Advice indicating that none of the claims could be processed and were denied with the following codes:
 • CO-16
 • MA112
 • MA130

After reviewing the claims in Office Ally, I noticed that the rendering provider NPI was mistakenly populated with our group NPI instead of the individual therapist’s NPI. Before we resubmit the claims, I just wanted to confirm whether this was the cause of the denial.

2. For patients treated by a PTA, the PTA’s name appears as the rendering provider, but the supervising PT’s NPI is the one that shows on the claim.

My questions are:
- Should the rendering provider name be the supervising PT and not the PTA, even when modifier CQ is used?

- If we change the rendering provider name to the PT, will Medicare deny the claim because modifier CQ was used (since the PT did not personally provide the treatment)?

- If the rendering provider must be the PT, what is the correct way to update the rendering provider name and NPI when our EMR (JaneApp) automatically lists the PTA as the rendering provider, even when the note is co-signed by the PT?

3. Since JaneApp + Office Ally autofill the rendering provider based on the clinician who wrote the note, we do not have the ability to manually replace the rendering provider name before EDI submission.

What would be the correct solution for this?

Submit corrected claims manually through NGSConnex so we can manually update the rendering provider name and NPI?

or

Is there a way to continue submitting through Office Ally while overriding the rendering provider field so it always reflects the PT’s name/NPI for Medicare billing?

Also, would there be any conflict having both EDI enrollment with Office Ally AND manual claim submissions via NGSConnex?

Any clarification or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated before we resubmit the claims.

Thank you!

Certification period is ending, do I send a POC to physician to sign even though there are no goals and I don't think PT is needed?  If I don't send a POC, and denial is overturned, I wouldn't be in compliance with POC requirement.  Should I also continue with 10th visit progress note?

Hello everyone,

I have been doing a combination of HH and OP for years. Recently, I began my medicare credentialing to start seeimg medicare part b at patient's home, along with my regular HH. Recently, the owner of a the small practice that I have been working will be closing his practice and no longer renew his lease, which is up in 1 - 1.5 months.

The owner and I recently spoke during a slow day, about possibly me taking over. The question is, I would love to take over but would also want to have my business name instead of the current one. 

But all credentialing/billing for insurances and medicare is under his current business name. If I buy him out, or just take over, with the current business and me as the new owner of the entity, is there a possibility of changing the business name in the not too distant future, while keeping all credentialing/contacts with the insurances?

Thank you all!

Hi group,

I am already credentialed with Medicare thanks to my first employer out of PT school. If I want to begin billing under a LLC or PC that I create, would anything need to change in PECOS? If so what would need to be changed?

Also, initially I would like to bypass purchasing an EMR. Do I register for an EDI so that I can submit electronic claims? 

Was planning to do my documentation in Google workspace. 

I also researched registering for NGSConnex to manage reimbursement from Medicare.

I am just making sure I am not missing anything and I guess looking for some validity from those who have done this before.

Thank you very much in advance.

Hi Everyone! 
I have just come across a patient that wants to use her HRA through Cigna. She doesn’t have an HRA card/debit card to use through my EMR. She called insurance and they told her she needs to get a doctors referral, then I would bill her insurance. (We think that it would hit her OON deductible then HRA would reimburse her.)

I’ve charged HSA accounts in the past without issue. My concern is that I have never billed an insurance before as I usually give patients a super bill. And I really don’t want to bill the insurance since I’ve heard that can be rough. 

Has anybody dealt with an HRA before?

I assume I would need a HIPPA form signed and sent over to answer those questions? How do other people answer these questions? Also, I haven’t seen any workers comp patients.

Need advice on what to say to lawyer. Talking to them next week. 

So originally the kawyer had reduced our amount to $2500 and $1500 for husband and wife. Which we emailed back saying we accepted those amounts.

Then the husband came to our office and asked for reduction in our fee.

I spoke with the husband and told him there’s nothing we could do and it would be fraud if we reduced our amount for him to get more money back.

Well a few days later the lawyers office send us a check for $500 for the husband and $900 for the wife…..

I emailed the lawyer and asked what happened to our original amount.

Here’s what they said: After speaking with my clients looking at the medical billing, you billed Medicare for all of Mr (husband) visits and some of Ms. (Wife’s) visits.  Under Medicare rules, providers are not allowed to balance bill patients.  The payment of $500 represents Mr. (Husbands) copays.  There should have been a separate check for Ms. (Wife’s) in the amount of $900 for the visits that were not willed to Medicare.”

I have no idea what to even say. I’m so pissed. We charged the wife our self pay rate because she was not on Medicare. So I don’t understand how the lawyers office can reimburse us Medicare rate…. 

And for the husband, they only covered his copay and NONE of the dry needling….

Hi everyone! I’m a PT from the state of PA. I just got my application completed and submitted to Medicare last week. I was wondering what others saw was the turn around for when they got their site visit? Could it be within a week to a couple of weeks? Did they give any notification? I am prepared, but there are a few days I may not be able to be here for other appointments so I just want to know how to navigate that. TIA!

Question for those of you using Hellonote...
This is the first time I have had this situation happen. I was treating someone that was going to be an auto insurance case and then we found out their MedPay was exhausted. Now I have to attempt to bill her medical insurance, which is UHC MC Advantage PPO plan. The case was a self pay case and now will be Medicare, so my billing is now needing to be changed to 8-min rule. Any suggestions on the correct way to accomplish this?

Questions on credentialing with insurances:
Can someone explain some of the basics of accepting insurance as in-network vs out of network?
Advantages/disadvantages of one over the other?  
To accept out-of-network, do you still have to credential/enroll with each specific insurance carrier?  
Is there a company that you all would recommend to help with enrollment if I wanted to explore that route?
For myself, I am venturing into starting a mobile practice.  I have already submitted for Medicare enrollment under my business. My main initial referral lead is coming from a local hospital rehab doc, and they had indicated that me being able to accept all the patients, not just Medicare patients,  would make it easier and more likely to refer so they didn't have to take the extra step in checking insurance. 
I would be operating in Indiana, if that makes a difference.

Quick question about OON clients…

I have a mobile Med B, OON and private pay practice. I know for Medicare my clients must be seen in-home since that’s how my business is established. My contract OT would like to see a client with OON benefits at an office space she rents hourly because the client has a very aggressive dog at home. Does anyone know if this is allowed since they’re not Medicare and it’s not an insurance we’re contracted with? If it matters, the insurance is UHC PERA which I’ve worked with preciously but always at the patients home. 

Thanks in advance for any input!

Hey team, 
I have had some poeple reach out for telehealth, but as insurance questions pop up, they have either Medicare or Medicade as their primary insurance. Per word of mouth from other medical providers these certain people legally can not pay cash for any medical services with it being a goverment insurance. If I am not contracted with any insurance,  what have others done in these situations with these types of patients? Or can they pay cash for PT?

Hi everyone! My name is Hannah and I am an OT and have been working for a startup called Reactiv for the last two years. I’m currently looking to connect with a OT/PT that works with their own practice.

We are in the beginning stages of a pilot to explore the new Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) codes. These are new CPT codes that allow for therapists to bill for monitoring patient's doing outside of the clinic.

DM me here or on LinkedIn ([www.linkedin.com/in/pughhann](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fpughhann%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3ykk99upm4dLW40_-Fm_yB3Q3dT6wFlhon-WrWAwFsajTyV4-VCJxhizM&h=AT2_QPYQiGOXowl8fkV5LFtMs0RixtJ2JJjYyFUlLwc7DvumQLqBcH8MysWrBNEh3-XvcWF4wahI8bk3atMWN7FgAu67uvm8nI-udQEoQwvd8f44uIVxvAK-tVduaIWxotD-Hc5ud0VpPs7Em9DUdIM&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT2-P7JkgELOcG4wLx7lGuYHUeLd9lqHmJVLzfsuGeQcB7o_HTFiq0hoQVuOon7DRXuL27y1xUgffDrGBqHmP-Hv1GEK425pIxF7re6T5_O9RxNryTX92_Y6_OJt_11GoxDCjsafCLn_rM7tJOzjFLhcDmM-3b_0)) if you are interested in learning more about RTM or want to learn more about Reactiv or piloting within your clinic.

Similar questions to this have been posted comparing specific EMRs, and I understand there isn't a perfect EMR system but when comparing EMRs what are some things to look out for and ask when receiving a demo?

It be for a  clinic accepting Medicare and OON to start but that change (may accept BCBS in-network and a couple others insurances) after some Initial marketing for my region, but hoping I can stay OON for the majority of them!

Thanks!

Can someone explain to me billing for Medicare part b via federal vs Medicare thru a private insurance company such as Atena?

I was always taught from school to treat them the same, following Medicare guidelines, rules and regulations. But is it different since one is through a private source when it comes to what guidelines we follow? Are reimbursement for a hybrid - in person/home sessions different?

I was talking to someone recently as was told "its different" and I wanted to hear more about it because it was something eye opening to me.

Good afternoon everyone! I have a billing issue that I need a bit of clarification on. I am OP mobile OT provider serving the pedi population. I billed a couple of sessions to a PPO BCBSTx plan that I finally got my remittance report for. I billed Place of service in the home. Insurance is not reimbursing for “home visits” but will provide 70% reimbursement for office visits. Do I simply change the place of service to get reimbursement. Is that even ethical? most of my caseload is bcbs tx and I haven’t ran across this issue yet. Thanks in advance!

Trying to better understand the superbill process...  I am waiting to get credentialed by BCBS but have quite a few patients ready to schedule when they can. 
Possible scenario:  I could treat a patient with "normal" documentation including codes and units charged.  The total may be around $200 but I could give the patient a "prompt pay discount" that would lower it to around $100-$150. Patient would pay this amount day of visit and I could provide them a Superbill which they would submit to insurance for possible reimbursement for OON coverage.  
I am new to this world.... Does that process sound right and appropriate for where I'm at with credentialing??  TIA!

Hey all. I am currently a full-time home care physical therapist. I’ve had patients (non Medicare) ask me to continue seeing them cash-based after home care discharge for general wellness/more like personal training.

I do not have my personal training certification. 

Explain to me like I am 5 the steps I need to take to CYA and be able to see non-Medicare patients for cash.￼ Is there some kind of form or waiver I have them sign that I am not privately affiliated with any insurance and cannot bill insurance? They are agreeable to cash only I just don’t want them to later try and submit to insurance. I have my own private liability insurance outside of work as well. What kind of records/notes do I need to keep? 

Appreciate any advice, I’ve never seen patients privately before!￼

Currently working at an OP setting but have future plans to open my own practice. They’ve been great with credentialing and have taken care of the whole process. Im now able to sign off with Medicare, WComp, And Auto insurance. I’ll soon be able to bill for Medicaid and other commercial insurances. My question is, will I be able to use my current credentials in my own future practice to bill for these insurances? Or do I have to go through the whole process again to become credentialed with these insurances?  Ideally I would like to be solely Cash based but would consider using Medicare. Any help would be great. Thanks!

Have any mobile therapist dealt with BCBS federal?  I have a potential patient that has Medicare part A and BCBS federal (doesn’t have Medicare part B ). BCBS of MS will only reimburse for treatment in a clinic.

For those seeing a patient out of network do you bill them the full charge of what you bill insurances or do you bill your cash pay charge?

When receiving EOBs the insurance puts they owe the provider the full amount. Just curious what others are doing! Would love your ethical advice!

Hi! Another question for the speech therapists out there! 

If a speech therapist evaluates swallowing AND speech  production can they bill TWO evaluation codes or just pick the one that fits best?

Can you please send me examples of your codes? I have a list from ASHA too. 

Thank you!!

If you used to take insurance, and moved to an all cash business model, how did you do it?
I currently take Medicare and BCBS. I only have 2 Medicare patients left, and decided I will no longer take new ones, and will just dc them at end of current poc. No recerts. Warning them ahead, helping referring to a different provider etc. 
trying to decide how to proceed with BCBS ones? Because There are 3 BCBS current patients. I expect I will be done with them by august. And 2 new BCBS patients that want to start with me. I talked about no longer taking BCBS, and they are ok with it if able to submit to insurance. But that won’t work until I am in network. 
Best way to do it?? I am considering taking them but warning that as of x date (thinking August 1st) I will be out of contract and any additional visits will be cash based…. And sending request to terminate contract as of same day… would this work? Or should I just not take patients who have that insurance until contract ends?

I’m looking to hire some PTs for my mobile practice. I’m currently in network with Medicare and I know that if the PTs that I’m hiring are not credentialed with Medicare Yet, I need to complete the 855i and then the 855r forms to reassign their benefits to my company. I was wondering- if they are already credentialed with Medicare, I only need to complete the 855r right? And would I be able to have them start treating patients while their 855r is being processed? Or is it best to wait until their 855r is fully processed before having them treat patients?
