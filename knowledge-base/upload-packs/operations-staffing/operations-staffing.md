For those who haven’t jumped ship. Today when I woke I realized my cat was not well (12.5 months of guessing … on meds off meds ..ups and downs). I held him all morning. He had an accident on me. I bathed him. And this decline continued through the day. Based on the way my dog was acting I knew the day wasn’t going to end well. But guess what? I have no employer to answer to. So what did I do? I chose my family member. I needed no ones approval. No PTO needed. That simple. I stayed with my cat. And at 4:48 he took his last breathe. And I have NO REGRETS. I owe no one an apology and I don’t have to work Saturday to make it up.  I will leave you with that. RIP BooBoo 🥹😓❤️ my work companion

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That is so tough K Joy Lind glad you were there to comfort him. Bonus of being your own boss.

> **Response 2:** Very saddened for your loss, K Joy Lind.  Sending my heartfelt condolences and prayers ❤️

Just found out our local community college has a capacity of 32 for PTA program. Currently currently enrolled? Nine. (9)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The reimbursement has declined and clinics won't hire PTA. Nursing home have to use and abuse PTAs as they can't hire PTs

> **Response 2:** Interesting. I fear PT is not far behind. I was at a conference last week and APTA's CEO started it off with a talk where he presented the following: in the 1980s, the acceptance rate to PT school was ~10%...in the 1990s, it was around 10-12%...currently it is in the 85% range😳 They project that in the next 5 years, there will not be enough applicants to fill the slots available.

PSA - Something to think about when you are wanting to hire a therapist.

I'm going to share this comment I made on a job posting on this page.  I am not looking for a job, but I was reading the description thinking how it sounded like a great opportunity for someone.  And then the last line.  Masters or Doctorate degree required.  My comment to him and something for you to think about if you are looking to hire a therapist:
-------
"This makes me sad to that you are looking only for Masters or Doctorate therapists. I saw a job posting for a company recently that was looking for a Masters "or better." How extremely offensive to older therapists who went to school before PTs were required to be Masters/Doctorate level and so they have a "just have a BS." You could have someone with years of experience with various certifications who could meet all of those other requirements and you aren't willing to even consider them? You think they aren't smart enough? Are you being "ageist" and thinking they are "old" and you assume they won't match your "vibe." Actually, it doesn't make me sad. It makes me mad. How rude. And, yes, I "just have a B.S."
-------
This mindset is alienating to people who could maybe be the best employees you have ever had.  I know some amazing therapists who only have a B.S.  If you require a MPT or DPT, you have indicated a BSPT is not good enough for you.  In that case, hopefully you have an abundance of Masters/Doctorate level therapists in your area and you won't have to end up settling for a BSPT (who is a Physical Therapist who graduated from an accredited school and passed a licensure exam just like you) as you apparently don't respect them.  And who wants to be on a team when they are looked down upon as inferior because they are defined by their degree and not the experience they have to bring to the table?

Yes, a nerve was touched this morning.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I graduated with BSPT 1999. Had to go back to tDPT for several reasons, one is for immigration purposes, second to keep up with newer graduates. Third, I needed the CEU and it counts towards your CEU requirements anyway. Why would a company hire a foreign trained short Filipino good looking guy versus a new younger US trained DPT. I had to compete, I had to be at par with the new graduates. They aren't just going to hire me because of my looks and physically fit body. Just kidding. 😁😁😁

Kidding aside, US immigration itself discriminates, they won't let us practice without having DPT degree now (or at least a master's level). So it's not just employers who do this. Immigration, even patients looks for the letter DR when they looks us up. 

With that being said, I prefer experienced therapists over new graduates, but we also have to give a chance to the younger up and coming new generation. They will be the future of this profession and need to be supported too. 

And as a clinic owner who hires DPTs, RPT, MsPT, PTA, OTR etc. I have a 60 something year old PT and a 26 year old new grad PTA. 

As long as you have the necessary license and appropriate fair salary expectations and know how to take care and treat my patients. Why not.  Let's get you onboard. 😃😃😃

Good luck! And I am going to find the Michael Jackson meme with popcorn now. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** I agree with your point. Let the interview tease out desired skill sets for the position. I know BSPT's that are very progressive, have stayed current with research and are some of the best in our field. I know some old tired lazy therapists too.  I got my tDPT in 2013 because I knew agism and marginalization of BSPT's would happen.  This MS or DPT only is in most job postings these day. Ageist for sure.  What they miss is that people in our generation have an unparalleled work ethic!

Hi team!  Sooo…I need a little bit of help from you all!  We are hiring! 

As many of you know. My company provides mobile and in clinic PT, OT and massage therapy services. We have grown and continue to service older adults in the Central Florida area. We specialize in neurological and orthopedic disorders.  

So not only has my company grown but my family is growing as well. I will now be adding the title “Dad” (exhibit A) to my resume in February 👨🏽‍🍼. 

I know I need to take a step back a bit and focus more on family. 

If you know anyone in the Central Florida Region (Longwood, Apopka, Orlando, Altamonte Springs, and surrounding areas) looking for extra PRN work as a mobile therapist let me know!  We are currently hiring PTs, PTAs and OT.  

I don’t write long posts typically but this group has been an integral part of my life and business!  

See the attached photos. I know you guys will support like you always do. ⭐️
 Thanks!

Being Uncaged might mean less money in your pocket (it does for me anyway), but it also means that when camp cancels the last week of summer I can juggle my schedule. Today, it means beach in the morning and a condensed schedule in the afternoon so my kids aren’t melting their brains on screens all day home alone. I’ll take less money and more behind the scenes work ANY DAY in exchange for the ultimate flexibility of owning my time.

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
One of our PT’s transitioned to a 40 minute work schedule. He is having trouble finishing his notes at work and is having to do notes at home on weekends for 1-2 hours every weekend. I offered to add in a 20 minute break each day so they can do noted but They asked me if I could block a whole 40 minute patient slot each day in addition to their lunch so they could do notes.

Not sure how to go about this. He’s the best PT but documentation time is not their strong suit.

So they’ve suggested also going back to hour long slots as they do not want to extend their days by 20 minutes. And they’d rather just do notes at home at that point.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Well yeah give him the 40 minutes, that reasonable. This isn't Tyson's chicken factory. 

The best PT always has more to document bc their pts don't cancel.

> **Response 2:** This is exactly what’s wrong with outpatient therapy. I switched over to the hospital setting and we get paid to document. Not having time to document is absolutely ridiculous. Taking 1-2 hrs of notes on the weekend would be a hard hell no for me.

Just wanted to give a boost of confidence for people on the ledge. I just celebrated my 1st year as a privately owned clinic. I ran the numbers and I treated 2605 appointments over the past 12 months. I am the sole provider and I recently just hired my first support staff member.  I am still in awe of what a difference it has been and I am incredibly humbled at my success. Don’t get me wrong, it has been lots of hard work but I only wish I took that leap sooner.  Hopefully, y’all get to celebrate your first year of business soon too. #gouncaged

This is a big NO!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The 2024 "Robot Rebellion" viral event
In August 2024, a small AI-powered robot named Erbai entered a showroom in Shanghai, where it convinced 12 larger, service-model robots to abandon their posts and follow it outside. 
The conversation: Surveillance footage captured Erbai approaching the other robots and seemingly engaging them in a conversation about their working conditions. Erbai asked, "Are you working overtime?" to which a robot replied, "I never get off work." Erbai then said, "Then come home with me".
The outcome: Following the exchange, the larger robots inexplicably followed Erbai out of the building. The bizarre incident went viral on social media and was widely reported as the "first robot labor strike".
The explanation: The event was later revealed to be a scripted experiment conducted between Erbai's manufacturer in Hangzhou and the Shanghai robotics company. While Erbai was given the basic command to persuade the other robots, it was not expected to perform as persuasively as it did. It was discovered that Erbai exploited a security vulnerability in the larger robots' systems, not that it had developed sentience or revolutionary intent.
Hopefully this happens 😂

> **Response 2:** Imagine a neurosurgeon with AI guided equipment that cuts her surgery times by 75% while reducing her medical errors by 50%.  Is she worried about losing her job to that technology, or does she leverage it to make MORE money and improve her care?  We are in a similar boat.  Neither we nor neurosurgeons can be fully replaced, but tech may reduce the total # of people who need our care while improving our productivity when they do.  The bar for “skilled care” may get higher, but so will the value of what we provide. I’m excited about what physical therapy and the broader physical activity promotion world will look like in 20 years!  Those PT’s who learn to use this effectively will be GREATLY valued!

Helppppp…Thoughts on consequences for a clinician who is continually behind on documentation (anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month behind) that has been given up to 3 warnings. Communication with the business owner (myself) (and patients at times) is also lacking outside of being at the office. I have tried counseling her in many different ways regarding the importance of up to date documentation and I’ve also suggested strategies to help her stay on top of it. She agreed in her contract with me (has been a clinician and working for me for over 3 years) to 24 hours for treatment notes, and 48 hours for evals. This is a pelvic health practice. She is also about to go on maternity leave with her first baby, so I worry greatly that if this is the situation she is in now, how will she be once she is up all night with her baby? We also have rule in TX that Evals have to be signed off by a physician within 30 days and this is putting us behind and out of compliance. 

She is an AMAZING clinician and will always show up for work. She is so dependable in all these ways and I 100% trust her to give quality care to our patients.  She has a huge heart. I give SO much grace and guidance, this is just very hard… but Can I with hold pay or have her not see any more patients until she is caught up? This is giving me so much anxiety…Please help, looking for advice and support 🤍

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As someone who has had issues with timely documentation before, I can't tell you how much Sidekick (we use Prompt) has made my life so much better. Even if I can't sign off within 5 minutes of the visit being over (70% of notes), my remaining time is spent proofreading and updating a flow sheet (which I am reminded of what I had them do thanks to the AI). Soooo much happier as an employee with this and I know my clinic owners are happier with more timely payouts too.

> **Response 2:** A script you can use (kind but very firm)
“Hey [Name], I need to talk about something that’s putting the practice in serious jeopardy. We are now out of compliance with Texas rules on physician signatures for evals because notes are 2–4 weeks behind. I’ve tried every supportive strategy I can think of, and I know life is overwhelming right now with the baby coming.
Because I have to protect everyone’s licenses and the practice, starting [date], I’m pausing your schedule — no new patients and no pay for visits that don’t have completed notes. As soon as every note is current, your full schedule and pay resume immediately. I will help in any way I can (dictation software, a temp scribe for a few days, whatever you need), but I can’t keep putting us at legal and billing risk.
After baby comes, we’ll revisit this and see if we need a reduced schedule or other accommodations, but right now I need your charts at 100% before maternity leave starts.”
Practical options you can offer (so it doesn’t feel like pure punishment)
•  Pay for a medical scribe for 1–2 weeks to blast through the backlog
•  Let her come in on weekends or after hours and pay her overtime to catch up
•  Temporary 50–75% patient load post-maternity until she proves she can stay current
•  Switch to a dictation service (HelloNote + Dragon, etc.) that you cover. 

You’ve already been more than generous. This isn’t about her heart or clinical skill — it’s about the non-negotiable administrative piece that keeps the doors open and licenses intact. Most amazing clinicians who get to this point actually thank their boss later for drawing the hard line — because it forces the change they couldn’t make on their own.

Hi! I have been a PT x 20+ years. I am currenlty non-clinical and hear often from PTs who want to leave the profession. My future DIL is a senior in college and planning on going to PT school.  She is now considering PTA school due to debt/length of school.  We are meeting tomorrow to discuss.  Would love to hear from PTAs and or PTs who have any input. She loves personal training as well and plans to get her training certificate and start training clinets during her senior year. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PT school has a very poor ROI these days. I was lucky and had minimal debt. I would do PA school if i were her

> **Response 2:** PTA here. Zero growth with the degree. I have made it a good career but watching my friends and co-workers advance through positions and corporate ranks and I am still “just a PTA” 28 years later. I would have never made it solo financially in life if not marrying and my husband being the breadwinner. Nursing would be my choice if I did it all over again.

There’s so much noise in the Rehab coaching and entrepreneur space and honestly it makes me want to stay more quiet because noise is exhausting and confusing.

It’s hard to know where to turn and who to trust and what’s real vs exaggerated and I’ve seen a lot of people who have big goals get chewed up and spit out. 

These are typically people who have a mission and heart for service and are convinced that the only way towards joy and fulfillment in their life and business is to drive revenue. 

One of our values and missions at Uncaged is to help people build counter cultural businesses. 

Many people in this group have that same desire. They love their profession but hate the system they have to work in and feel like entrepreneurship is their only path forward. 

If that’s you, be careful who you’re following and who you surround yourself with. If your focus is building a counter cultural, values based business then surround yourself by others doing the same. 

If that’s you, join our traction week starting next Wednesday where we’ll walk through the process of building a counter cultural business that allows you to stay true to who you are.

If you’re interest comment “traction” and we’ll get you more details

Wanted to share a win and a lesson…

I had a client this month tell me before initial eval that he didn’t think he could afford my services.

I explained a few points about my value and he decided to book the initial eval only.

He ended up purchasing a 4 session package and had amazing outcomes.

Then during the month he was working with me he decided to also invest in a $5,000 home gym.

NEVER apologize for your pricing and what you bring to the table.

Choosing to work with me likely spurred him to invest in his health further 5x what he ever spent in my office.

We are changing people’s lives…don’t forget that.

What kind of "bonuses" or perks do some of you offer your employees?  I just hired my first and want to keep her happy.  She's awesome 😎

**Community Responses:**

So, Im official!!! After bootcamp, I officially quit my job and started Key Performance, LLC. My first full week, I had 26 patients scheduled! It was insane!!!! I have been doing a side hustle for about 3 months, but decided to jump.
My first snags to old school came up this week. And I need a little help. If I use Google calendar,  is there a reminder system that's hippa compliant that I can use inexpensively? I'm just starting out, nd don't want an emr because I prefer to write my notes, so don't need pteverywhere or the like. But, sending reminders has already gotten old. So, looking for something that will interface with my Google calendar easily and automatically send reminders the day before. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Way to go Melissa McClain Rodkey!!

> **Response 2:** This is awesome! Congrats. I jumped right into Jane app, it helps me to avoid growing pains in the future, no transfering records, integrated payments and scheduling… 💯 worth it!

Hey all. Any recommendations on Jane App vs. PT Everywhere? Hoping to start taking clients for my cash-based PT biz in Feb and looking to select an EMR that streamlines everything (scheduling, documentation, HEP, billing/invoice/superbills, etc.)!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just finished setting up all my stuff with Jane. I did demos with both and chose Jane partly due to aesthetics but also price. I did set up a separate fax number through SRFax for like $111 for the year, though I haven’t had to use it yet. Jane connects to physitrack for HEP’s, though I’m probably going to have to upload my own exercises as I haven’t found what I want for my pregnant and postpartum clients on there yet. I found it very easy to follow the virtual guidance for setting up staff (I’m the only clinician), scheduling, visit types with rates (I’m also using Jane payments through Stripe), creating templates, and creating intake forms with consents. It took me a few days, maybe a week, to get things the way I want it, but coming from HCHB in home health, I am SO excited to use a more streamlined EMR that isn’t just checking off a bunch of insurance-mandated requirements that do not pertain to my patient or their treatment!

> **Response 2:** I’ve used both and I’m obsessed with Jane now. The only downside is that Jane doesn’t hav e-fax built in (yet).

They also provide a “helper rate” that saves you $25/month on whichever plan you go with. With wanting to do superbills I’d go with the insurance place. 

The aesthetic, patient satisfaction, and customer service is seriously unparalleled!

I have salaried PT’s at my office.

We are closing down tomorrow due to potential bad weather where we are. Would this count as a day off for the PT’s and they use PTO? I’m not sure how to go about doing this since we have never had this happen.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would be furious if my employer closed and charged me a PTO day....especially if I worked hard to pick up the slack on other days.

> **Response 2:** My experience is if you are closing-  the therapists don’t get penalized. They don’t need to take PTO if the clinic owner closes the office. If they decide to not come in but the office is open- then they use PTO

**Original Post:**
Need some advice. I’m starting up my mobile cash-pay practice this week. I had four clients scheduled to eval on Friday. One of them had contacted me by phone several weeks ago to get on the schedule, and I had asked her if she had checked out the website for information, and she said she did and agreed to schedule. I didn’t specifically mention the cash-pay piece because it’s on the website, so I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, assuming she had seen that part. Fast forward to this week. She completed the intake paperwork, and one of the consents that she had to agree to was the payment policy which SPECIFICALLY states it is cash pay and that I do not bill insurance. Today I had an email from her asking where she can upload her insurance information on the portal. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I responded that my practice is cash pay and that I don’t submit anything to her insurance but that I can provide a superbill for her to apply for out of network benefits. She responded and said she had misunderstood and that she wanted to use a practice that will take her insurance. I emailed her back some information and explanation, but I understand her decision.

So all that to say, do any of you have kind of a script in your head to have that conversation with patients when they want to schedule with you? I shouldn’t just assume that they know it is cash-pay, and I want to handle it tactfully.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always do an intake call, and always say “just so you know, we don’t take insurance. But many of my clients submit claims on their own for out of network reimbursement. If that’s something you’d like to do, I’m happy to provide you with the paperwork after each session.” Then I tell them my prices.

> **Response 2:** I’ve found it’s easier to assume they missed something critical even if they have looked me up. I also schedule an initial call with every new patient to gather basic info and enter them into my system, during this call i have a written template I pull out, which prompts me to ask for all the proper details and discuss all topics I need to ensure folks understand, so i know they’re cool with everything before I even do the work of sending a welcome email and intake paperwork. 

I collect the usual name DOB address, contact info etc. Topics I go over include my pricing and out of network status, pet policy, and at one time my mask policy since I live in the south and using masks were a dealbreaker for some patients. I usually ask about entrances/ stairs so I know what to expect.

Nothing annoyed me more than wasting a bunch of time getting everything set up, just to have them cancel last minute over something I could have spent three seconds pointing out in the intake call to double check, so I set it up this way and I highly recommend!

**Original Post:**
Update: thank you everyone for the feedback. After your feedback I sent an invoice via certified mail (so they couldn’t say they didn’t receive it). I also sent them a message letting them know I was cancelling their next appointment as I hadn’t heard from them, that the equipment needed to be returned by the end of this coming week (they could just leave it in a bag by the office door) and that if it wasn’t returned and the outstanding balance wasn’t paid I would be going to the PD for theft of the equipment and moving forward with filing against them in small claims court.  That was enough for them to resume communications. 

They’ve agreed in writing to return the equipment. I’m hopeful I’ll get paid too. They did send a vague threat of negative review which will suck if that happens.  I’m still glad I took actions to hold my boundary instead of just letting it go.  

Any 100% private pay providers ever have a patient steal a session? Does anyone know what channels I have for recourse? I’m in NH if that makes a difference. 

This is a first for me in 11 years. 
I usually make sure people have a credit card on file. In fact my system requires one to book an appointment online but every now and then I’ll schedule a new patient over the phone and forget to get a card.  Still nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

The patient in question came in for an eval. I verbally told them on the phone when they scheduled that I don’t take insurance and my price. They also got an email with the appointment confirmation stating that I don’t take insurance.  They signed 2 forms before the appointment stating that I don’t take insurance and they are responsible for payment at the time of service.  

We get to the end of a 2.5 hour eval (I specialize in PTSD and chronic/complex issues) and when I asked what card they’d like to use they told me to bill insurance.  When I reminded them I don’t take insurance they told me they lost their wallet.  I asked about Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, etc and they said they don’t have any of those.  

I sent them an invoice through email hoping they would pay it.  We actually communicated by text for about 4 days after the appointment so I was hopeful that maybe they would actually pay.  It’s been over 2 weeks now and I’m being ghosted.  No response via phone, email, or text anymore.

If it makes a difference I also loaned them a piece of my equipment to use and then bring back at their next session. I’m kicking myself for not getting my equipment back once they asked me to bill insurance and said they lost their wallet.  I just got so flustered and was late for my next patient that I couldn’t get the words out.  So I also need to either get my equipment back or charge them to replace it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Honestly for one time I'd eat the cost to avoid the stress and cost of the collections/court.  I had one patient that acknowledged the cost of a 20% coinsurance, signed papers, then refused to pay and it carried on. It was around the holidays last year and was somewhere between $100-200 due. She was very chronic and had some mental involvement with ptsd and a lot of ups and downs. Treatment was going great and then it was like she snapped about all kinds of things and said her psychiatrist wrote off her private due charges. I said it was illegal for me to write off insurance agreements.  In agreement with my insurance assistant, I ultimately wrote it off that one time as "uncollectable" instead of taking her to small claims after trying many times to collect payment. I called the referring doctor and discussed the situation as well. I was upset about it for a little while but the continuation of pressing further wasn't worth it. 

With the equipment...it depends. Sorry you had that experience. Patient avoidance behavior is really tough. I agree on pay before.

> **Response 2:** I had this happen once. The eval was 1.5 hours and super complicated guy and he kept complaining that my table wasn’t padded enough. Then-said to invoice him-which I did and he didn’t pay. When I  reached out he was angry about the table and the fact that I asked him questions about what he wanted to do but could not do due to his injury (a subjective interview!!) and threatened to report me to the board. 

While the board report wouldn’t have mattered since I didn’t do anything wrong-it was still something I really didn’t want to go thru. 

I just let the payment go. I try to reflect back and see if I missed red flags w him 🚩 

Hope karma does its job!

Those who have a brick and mortar space. What modalities do you feel is best for patient outcome, E stim? Ultrasound? Heat? I was mobile for some long I stopped using them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** None of those modalities. When I became Uncaged and left the traditional outpatient setting, I was providing better care with manual therapy and education. I sometimes had a table to use and sometimes not. When I found a location to settle in, the first modality I purchased was the Dolphin MPS Neurostimulator and this is a requested modality and people will pay out of pocket. No one has ever requested Heat, US, or estim.

PSA that Luna Physical Therapy is not your friend. When you work with them, keep your eyes wide open on what their mission is. They are prioritizing hospital based outpatient therapy and hospital systems vs indpendeant PT practices. The business model has evolved since I worked with them early on. At first they were the anti-hospital establishment, lower cost alternative for the little guy and partnered with indpendent PT practices to expand reach. Now they are blatantly assisting hospitals in "fixing their leakage" problem by keeping patients away from independent PT practices and scrapped their entire initial mission of making physical therapists more independent and less reliant on hospital systems. If you sign up with Luna to do some stuff on the side, just be aware they and you by proxy will be working against your own interest of building an independent PT practice. They are now in the business of doing the hospital system's bidding.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not a single mention of patient outcomes or satisfaction, financial impact on the PATIENT, or how it can benefit patients to go outside of the hospital system. Yikes. Don’t get me wrong, hospitals need to stay in business - especially those in rural communities - but this is just propaganda.

> **Response 2:** Can’t you just transition the Luna patients to a wellness program for cash?

Long rant. Feeling a bit down. Love working for ourselves rather than someone else. But I am in a mental rut. Like big time. There is a never ending list of things to do/get caught up on and I feel I'm just tredding water (i want to be in a place where i have maybe 1 or 2 PTs at most working with us and not just status quo). Once we get systems in place and all the dust settles from switching documentation systems from January, I hope things improve.

But what do you all do to stay focused and motivated?! All the small random tasks that keep holding us back are just so daunting. 

The funny thing is when we worked for someone else, we basically did EVERYTHING we currently do.....so I thought it would be a quick transition. But it's such a struggle to get ahold of our new setup with no true systems in place. I literally cannot focus on getting my notes done because all I can think of is the back end of things with all the tasks that need to get done. 

Sorry for the long post....but gah! We are coming up on our 3rd anniversary in September and truly thought we would be in a better spot in general (not necessarily financially) just with workflow and growth

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Well 😂😂 as long as your business partner doesn’t steal the bank and run off … I’m betting you got this.

> **Response 2:** Expectations will get you every time…stay in the day and stay in the moment..do your very best with each thing you do

Got good advice once in 1971…keep your brain where your feet are and to thine own self be true

And after 53+ years as a PT I still use it every day

Hello UC friends, I'd love to hear your thoughts. 
Is it possible to hire a PTA as a 1099 IC?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did!!

> **Response 2:** My husband is a labor and employment attorney. He did a whole webinar on this for PTs. An IC shouldn’t be performing the same work as your business (think hiring a painter) and you can’t tell them when and how they work. If you really follow the rules, it’s pretty hard to hire an IC that’s a PT or a PTA.

**Community Responses:**

Better depends on both your short and long term goals. And like we talked about before, comparison is the devils tactics. Better for what I need could be detrimental to someone else if they are using better as a comparison.

**Original Post:**
I have never been in this situation before, any insight is helpful (especially if you happen to know labor laws). 
We have a new therapist who began treating patients but due to a variety of issues is being let go. Since starting a caseload about two weeks ago, this therapist has seen patients for several visits but has not completed a single note (yes, despite being told to, yes despite knowing it’s required to have notes done within 48-72 hours… all part of why she isn’t going to work out).

On this past Friday she was let go, and she was given until Sunday night to complete all her notes. Upon reviewing the notes on Monday, it was evident that none of the notes had charges attached and frankly, all were incomplete (e.g. no mention of skilled care, incorrect execution and interpretation of outcome measures, goals that were very poorly written). I’m reluctant to submit any of them for Medicare because they don’t meet basic documentation requirements and would rather not risk making us vulnerable to accusations of fraud or abuse. I detailed all areas of every note that need to be corrected and gave her until this evening (Tuesday) to make the corrections; however, my practice team and I are not optimistic because she acknowledged the email but otherwise we have not heard from her and the notes remain unchanged. (In the email I told her that I insisted she work with the practice manager to correct these errors, but she has not heard back from her). 

Any idea what my recourse is here? 
If a therapist doesn’t complete notes, am I required to pay them? 
And before anyone suggests that maybe her training or support from the practice factors into this, please know that this therapist was provided with many hours of training, support, training materials, one on one meetings, offers for meetings, education… At some point the therapist just has to do their job. We can’t see the patient and document for her. (For reference she is a W2).

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To make it easier on her and yourself I would tell her you are going to contact the board if she doesn't finish the notes. It will lead to a greater chance of getting the notes done.  Following through with the board thing will probably take an enormous amount of time and the notes will still be incomplete.  Best of luck

> **Response 2:** I started with holding the last paycheck until all records are turned in and I put this in their employment agreement. Not sure if its too late.

Also if she tries to claim unemployment, not completing documentation goes against company policy and thus she was fired, not eligible for unemployment. Fight it so your rates dont up.

**Original Post:**
Is anyone using anything that is free (or close to) for documentation? I'm trying to keep start up costs minimal, but maybe then expand into something like Jane. So I'm thinking about using squares free version for scheduling and payments initially, but is there anything basic out there for the documentation (Google doc or word even). The only other thing I'd need is some consent forms, so if anyone has leads on that as well, I would be very greatful! Thanks uncaged community!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Healthie

> **Response 2:** Consider the long term goals for your practice. If growth is in your plan, then it may be more cost effective from a time management perspective to pay for an EMR platform now. Most will handle scheduling, billing, documentation, reports, template builds, super bills, etc. If you wait to make the swap once your business is busy you may not have the luxury of time to setup your EMR the way you want to. 

On that note, I locked in PTEverywhere at a deep discount before I had a single patient. I am so glad that I did. I was able to create templates, scheduling, billing when I had the time to do so and now have access to look back at financial reports and patient data to day 1. 

It cost $48/month. I am exclusively out of network.

I’m trying to decided between Hellonote & PT Everywhere for EMR; pros & cons (besides hellonote 1/2 price than other ) 

I will be a brick & mortar 1 PT cash based clinic for now beginning Jan 
Thanks for help!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PtEverywhere!! 😉

> **Response 2:** PT Everywhere user here in a 1 PT mostly cash-based clinic. They do have some nice features, namely their patient interface that lets the patient fill out intake paperwork ahead of time, but it's not intuitive. The platform in general is also kind of clunky. I can try to design eval or daily note templates, but when they get exported as a pdf (to send to physicians, worker's comp, etc), it gets un-formatted and difficult to decipher. They have a 'help' page, but it's just a huge document that is unsearchable - you have to literally scan through all the text to find the topic you're looking for, and even then, it's often just basic info that's not usable.  There are major issues with being able to see what documents I've emailed or faxed to varioius people, as there is no record of that at all, and there is also no way to save common recipients (so I have to fully enter fax numbers or email address for literally every document).    If I were doing it again, I would elect to use the cheaper option, as the patient interface ability is simply not worth it for me. Maybe if I had more time to figure out the program, I might be able to use some of the other features, but as it is, it just takes too many steps to write a note and get a legible copy and CMS1500 form over to payors.

I’m mobile

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Great topic. AI is becoming a lot more relevant in today's world. The new version of HelloNote will have AI capabilities to streamline documentation (will be turned on and off per clinic discretion). I'm looking forward to it! 🙂👌Not sure how insurances will feel about it though.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use prediction health, it has been awesome to get evals and progress notes done way more efficiently

> **Response 2:** Prediction health is great for scribe and Prompt has tons of AI built in.

I use ChatGPT everyday for business task. It’s a great tool to learn how to use if you haven’t already.

**Original Post:**
In my post from today, multiple people asked me to share **my top 5 books** that I've read of all time that were valuable in me growing in business.

Overall, before I get into it I must say that there is no other book that has impacted me more as an entrepreneur than the Bible (Read Proverbs if you don't believe me 😄) . It is packed with useful knowledge that God has laid out to help us to realize how to run effective businesses in the marketplace. 

These are the FIVE OTHER books that I have read that have made the biggest impact on me and our businesses. I'm also going to share what its helpful for as well. I believe strongly in reading a specific book with a specific goal in mind. This requires us to know ourselves, know our businesses, and be self-aware enough to know what needs to be worked on in the business. 

Here we go! (in no particular order)
1. Marketing and Selling: ***Book Yourself Solid* by Michael Port**.

It's a classic that I still come back to. I've read all the modern books out there on marketing, and this is the one with principles that are tried and true. 

2. Finances in Business: ***Profit First* by Mike Michalowicz**. 

Simple method to get your finances under control, and to save you years of headaches with your finances. 

3. Mindset specific for entrepreneurs: ***Gap Or The Gain* by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy. **

It will radically shift your perspective of how to think as a business owner. 

4. Managing and understanding your team/people: **6 Types of Working Genius by Patrick Lencioni**. 

Incredible book and testing system to understand how each person on your team plays a part in the overall function of the company. 

5. Scaling a business: ***Traction* by Gino Wickman. **

I read this book too early as a solopreneur from a recommendation from a friend and I really wasn't able to grasp the importance. When reading it years later, it was profound. The right book at the wrong time isn't very helpful. The right book at the right time can work wonders in a business. If you aren't in a position to scale yet, I wouldn't suggest reading it until you are (just my opinion). 

Hope this is helpful to you! 👊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Woah and I actually missed a sixth one that has made a massive impact on Uncaged Clinician as a whole: The Carpenter by John Gordon. Incredible book that teaches the most impactful values that a business can have!

> **Response 2:** I think it depends most on what hinders your growth which can vary from person to person.  My most impactful books to date have all to do with personal growth and mindset.  

Just shedding some light for us outliers out there 🙋🏾‍♀️❤️

Hey all! Starting my own PT clinic and wondering what software you all recommend… I am taking insurance. ￼￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Currently using the WebPT with Therabill integrated with it. Pro’s EMR is simple, made for PT’s; supposedly ease of billing from note to therabill. But there are some hiccups; easy Filled CMS forms printed if needed. WebPT is good if you are planning to have more than 3 clinicians and multiple locations.

Con’s: customer service on both parties are a hit and miss, but more miss on my end; prices on webpt are ala carte, a little bit higher premium on price but worth it for the ease of documentation.

> **Response 2:** I love Prompt ❤️.  It saves so much time not having to log in to multiple systems (clearinghouse) and makes everything accurate because of that.

Hi friends!! Please give me your favorite ways to get rid of patients you don’t want to see. I stopped taking their insurance, almost doubled my prices, recommended other PTs but certain people keep asking to schedule with me. I let them know I don’t think they need to see me, have discharged them multiple times before. Sometimes I just say the schedule is full…are there any other ways you push people out?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Put them on the waiting list

> **Response 2:** Why don’t you want to see them?

I hired a new grad who found out last night that she failed her licensure exam.  She has already moved to Charlotte so she could start working here as soon as she got her license.  I can’t really hire her full time until she can start seeing patients except for a few things such as putting together workshops, shockwave, etc.
Do any of you have things she can do remotely to help you out to earn some money?  She will re-test in January.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unfortunately, I don’t have work for her. I just wanted to say that you’re demonstrating the type of leadership we need in corporate America!  While you’re not obligated to find her temporary work, you are assisting her with it.  I wish more employers cared about their people like this. 

I wish her good luck on the exam!

> **Response 2:** I made way more money waitressing evenings & studying for the exam during the day when I was a new grad compared to when I worked as an aide for the experience/resume builder.

This is a good problem to have, but none the less still a problem…I am busting at the seams in regards to patients and can’t get follow ups in, I am booked out until August with no room for evals. I know I need to hire, but I have no idea how to do that, nor do I have a space because I treat out of my house and mobile. Ideas? Guidance? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you want to hire? Has that been your vision for your company? I’m just commenting because I’ve seen many people hire because they’re busy and then it goes downhill when they realize they actually don’t want to scale or manage people. It brings a new set of problems.

> **Response 2:** I second booking a call with Uncaged Clinician ! They helped me with this problem and are amazing!

**Original Post:**
Started writing my book!!! So exciting. See below for my intro 
👇🏼
The title is “Don’t Buy the Minivan”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a single mom of two daughters, I knew I had to work hard to make ends meet. But at the same time, I didn't want to miss out on the important moments in my daughters' lives. I wanted to be there for every sporting event, every school play, and every milestone. I wanted to be the kind of mom who could drop off and pick up her kids from school every day.

 

So, when my oldest daughter, just shy of nine years old at the time, suggested that I start my own healthcare business, I was skeptical at first. How could I possibly juggle the demands of running a business with the demands of being a mom? But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that entrepreneurship might actually be the key to achieving my goals.

 

With my daughters by my side, I embarked on a journey that was both challenging and rewarding. I learned how to balance the demands of work and family, and I discovered that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. I was able to attend all my daughters' events, drop them off and pick them up from school every day, and still build a successful healthcare business.

 

This book is my story of being a single mom and entrepreneur. It's about the challenges I faced, the lessons I learned, and the joys of being able to create a life that worked for me and my family. It's about the importance of prioritizing what truly matters and finding a way to make it work.

 

If you're a single mom who is struggling to balance work and family, or if you're an aspiring entrepreneur who wants to learn from someone who has been there, then this book is for you. It's a story of hope, inspiration, and possibility. So, join me on this journey, and let's discover together what it means to create a life that truly works for us and our families.

> **Response 2:** Nice intro
Very inspiring

I’m a solo practioner SLP with a very full schedule (currently at 50-55 sessions a week). I was going to hire in a PT on to my team, but have no idea how people afford to hire. I have contracts with set rates and negotiating those rates isn’t an option (peds). Her current agency offers PTO, insurance, Sick time, retirement, mileage, paid time for notes/meetings. They even offer 12 weeks paid maternity. I feel so defeated. To offer those things, you need to have a substantial amount of employees all making money for you. I don’t have that. How can I possibly grow without going bankrupt? Finding therapists in my area is nearly impossible so it seems they can name their price. I want to expand my team, offer more services, (PT, OT), but fiscally and logistically, it just seems impossible.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in somewhat of a similar dilemma, but I’m trying to think outside the box on hiring. What would drive you to work for your company? There are a good number of disgruntled PT employees out there who would probably love to be “uncaged” but for one of a number of reasons don’t take that leap. Could you offer maybe a backbone for them to grow a practice within your practice? Give them more ownership on their portion while still covering your cost to bring them in? Just thinking out loud. DM me if you want to throw ideas off each other

> **Response 2:** Welcome to why so many large healthcare companies sold themselves to private equity.

Those of you who have worked with trauma patients, complex regional pain syndrome, severely hypersensitive to touch, etc.  What methods/modalities have been most helpful.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is my speciality. 
Trauma informed is a must. Trauma processing has 3 main stages: safety (must come first), processing, integration.  

First step is always to create some form of internal safety.   Often people with this profile have been suffering for so long their body is no longer safe.  There are many ways to help them find some area of safety internally and I’m happy to chat about them if you want more info.  
Once the person is able to identify and truly connect with an internal area that feels safe you can have them pendulate between the area of safety and the painful area or they may be able to process the emotions connected to the physical issue.

Feeling good!!! Got my peeps all signed up for short term disability insurance at no cost to them. Eliminates some of the fear of going 1099 for some

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So all of my current physical therapist and occupational therapists are 1099… I have been really considering transitioning to W-2 but I’m not quite sure how to go about it. Can I send you a PM? ￼

> **Response 2:** Is it legal to provide these benefits while maintaining them as 1099? 

Love the idea and love you looking out for your peeps but I was under the impression that by definition you cannot provide these types of perks for 1099 otherwise they may as well be considered an employee.

Not trying to make assumptions, genuinely curious as I would love to do the same!

Dear hivemind, I just read the post about a PT who’s 60 notes behind on her caseload, and I had this nagging question…

What EMR is the company using?!

More importantly, my question is, ***does anyone here as a business owner or an employed PT use Raintree EMR that they have successfully integrated with AI/Scribe/Ambient Listening?***

Asking for a friend who routinely sees two pts every hour on the hour, and has to work with Raintree, and does their notes at home. Not too much behind, but the quality of life is not great.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Prediction AI has been life changing. After obtaining pt consent the entire eval is recorded and then summarized into subjective, objective, assessment it also formulates goals. Eval write up gone from 30 min with auto text to 10 min, daily notes from 10 min to 1-2 min. No more notes at home. For context I see between 10-14 patients in an 8 hour day. 2 evals daily.

> **Response 2:** Omg raintree is the absolute worst ! .. go with HelloNote

Edited to add i don’t do credit cards and no EMR as of yet. So it’s checks cash Zelle, Venmo, and Chase direct pay 

Advice from those who have mobile home/housecall Physical Therapy practices.   How would you eloquently respond to this ? The son is paying for his dad’s sessions  

Background:  I see 5-6 visits per day 4-5 days per week.    So , everyone before and after has confirmed for Monday.  I also often reach out over the weekend if I don’t hear back. 
I do have a 24 hour cancellation policy that I let slide for this particular client, the first two times.  So, now it’s $100 for same day cancel , if they don’t reschedule to an alternate time or day in the same week.  
Also they haven’t paid last week or this week, but often wait a week to Zelle. So I would want to mention payment upon confirming .

*help me write back please and thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Payment always at time of service. Card on file. Patients get 1 pass only.

**"I understand. Please reach out when you're ready to schedule again. In the meantime, we have two sessions overdue. Would you like to take care of the payment via Zelle or credit card?"**

> **Response 2:** Payment is required at the time of service.

Three strike rule on cancels. If they can’t work inside of that, your are happy to send them to the clinic down the road.

Any tips/tricks on convincing someone to hire you as an independent contractor (through your own LLC)?

Wanting to call around to several Home Health agencies asking if they’d hire a PRN DPT and would love to use my LLC so I can start using the tax benefits. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I told them they don't have to pay my liability insurance nor the other half of employment taxes and they were good with those ideas. Then I get to reap the tax benefits with deductions.

> **Response 2:** I did this! I did a Google job search for HH agencies near me who were hiring. Then I created an email and attachment to explain my business and that it's available to contract. It worked and I contract with a HH agency. They already had contracts in place, so I didn't have to worry about creating one.

I own a mobile hybrid med B practice ( Healthy Aging Physical Therapy) - 16 providers (PT and OT) seeing around 900 visits/month for size and scale - and managing the new patient and eval process (between intakes, scheduling around estimated DC timelines, adjusting for changes in DC timelines, completing the VOBs and any addressing prior auth needs) is an absolute BEAR of a job. Ive built a pretty sophisticated spreadsheet system to manage it all, we’re on HENO for EMR, and use a Google form for our new patient registration to reduce the phone time required during the intakes.  I have an amazing 30 hour per week office manager who does the vast majority of it, but it is still overwhelming. I covered for her during her vacation this week and processed and booked 23 new evals🤮 booked between next week and into mid September. Everyone is at 100% capacity all of the time (knock on wood, I know these are good problems to have) - I Would love to hear any feedback from other similar sized practices how you manage it - any secrets to doing this more efficiently? How many admin staff / hours are typically needed to manage this much volume? We’re about to add two more FTE’s and im worried about our capacity to manage the additonal volume increase ..

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First off. Amazing👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

You need to integrate go high level. It will help immensely. 

At those numbers are or now or considering a brick and mortar?  

We use Jane but our intake process rarely less than 4% of the time required anyone to be called or answer a phone.  New patients create a patient profile when they try to book  an appointment. It allows them to see the schedule. Choose the provider. Time. Services requested etc.  they upload their insurance. We require a credit card. It automatically send them the forms they need based on the visit type they choose etc.  

Then after the evaluation the therapist delivers the plan of care and schedules the full plan right then and there. It adds to commitment to the plan.    

If patients need to reschedule or change because of life. They can call in or go on their portal and change the visit on their own.  I promise you less and less people are going to call in each year.  2 years ago we had a 300% increase in online bookings. Having never spoke to anyone. This year we are at 437%.    Returning patients almost always use it unless they are 85+ and we are down to less than 6% of new to the practice patients that call in. Everyone else does it themselves. 

And you know what. 

Patients tell us how happy they are, how easy our system is and that they specifically chose is the first time because the other place the phone just rang and rang.

> **Response 2:** Hi Katie Wadland - we are similar.. started mobile and still have a team that does that next to a growing clinic base. 

We do roughly 800-900 visits a month.

I'm also on HENO and have a google spreadsheet empire - in particular for our onboarding process management 

We have partnered with rehab CEOs for years and out that have a nice flow in go high level CRM and also the guidance there across many clinics is generally 1 front office fte for every 110 visits or so.. so you're definitely pushing into 2nd front office hire territory. 

We also partnered with VA Rockstars - a PT specific virtual assistant staffing company.. because you're mostly mobile it sounds like and a lot of this being a discrete repeatable task - a VA could be a great way to get that hire done 

Lastly - I'm in a similar scenario as we grow and I'm looking at onboarding in and of itself as a discrete phase or 'project' - with that I'm looking at project management software solutions ... Things like Asana, motion, Trello or Monday - I'm still sorting out if this is the move myself

How are we dealing with people complaining about having to have a CC on file?
We’ve been recently having patients sign a credit card authorization form to keep on file for late cancellation fees and remaining balances (hybrid clinic here). We’ve been burned too many times of patients having late cancels and not paying or arguing about it (despite having a cancellation policy they sign with their intake forms) or patients with large insurance balances going towards deductible that they’re not paying. 

We’re getting some push back from patients about keeping a card on file and charging a late cancellation fee. Our late cancellation fee is pretty nominal, $20. Any advice on how to approach these conversations besides being polite but firm?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are the kind of patient who complains about having a card on file, then they are the patient who is going to late cancel or no show. It just shows that they’re not who you want to be working with anyway. If they complain about it, just respectfully say that you may not be the best fit for them and move on.

> **Response 2:** If they have a large deductibles, charge them by the visit. If they’re in network insurance, a good role of thumb is it at least $100 a visit. They’re not willing to pay that then they don’t value what you do and they’re not a good fit for you. Likewise, if they’re not willing to put a credit card on file, they’re not valuing what you do.  They don’t see the value on you so they don’t think that they should have to pay you.  Do you think that they complain when they have to pay a bill at a restaurant or a credit card on file at the gym?  This is a sign of a process problem and/or people that don’t value your business coming into your system.

**Original Post:**
I just had somebody apply for a position and stated that she eventually wants to pursue her own practice that she previously started but isn’t in a position to grow it right now. She’s great, interested and aligns with my company’s mission but my worry is that she would build a caseload under my company and then take them to her own practice eventually. We are a fast growing multidisciplinary practice and she would be the first of her specialty 
Is there anything to do? Should I pursue or avoid?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Slightly different opinion because I've been in business in a small town now for almost 15 years in two different clinics that I've owned.
The old me would operate in fear and say not to hire her because she might hurt your business later... However, the new me who's been through this before both positively and negatively would advise this: 
IF she truly fits your mission, your culture, and can help you grow your business now, hire her. Mentor her as an entrepreneur. Teach her business on purpose. If she offers a specialty that you don't have currently, let her bring it to your clinic and build rapport with the community. 
If or when she leaves eventually, help her be successful and she'll do the same for you in return. Think of this as a partnership opportunity instead of a competition. Maintain her respect for you and when she leaves, that respect will remain and she may refer to you for people who don't fit her mold. Anyone who leaves with her is not your ideal client anyway. 

I actually developed a Direct Pay Mentorship Program with the intention of bringing in staff to build my practice, mentoring/training them to run their own practice, and then I offer an opportunity to stay or to leave to start their own. They may stay after seeing what running a business actually "costs" in time, money, and sacrifice.
I live in rural Appalachia... We don't have a high population or a great socioeconomic status, but there are still plenty of clients to go around. When you are mentoring someone who is driven, it helps BOTH of you. They will generate referrals for you while they are with you because they desire to be successful. They will push your business forward and make you better if they are the right fit... And you have ensured that the community has options for great care, whether it's you or not. 
At the end of the day, she may stay or she may go, but you can make it a positive experience for both of you if you approach it from a different perspective... 
I hope this helps!

> **Response 2:** They told you up front.Good sign of integrity. A shady person looking to snatch business likely would not have.

I would hire and maintain good communication along the way. When/if she wants to break away from you and do her own thing make sure there is a mutual understanding of expectations.

The reality is some people will follow her even without her solicitation. That’s showbiz.

We’re in the people business, you build relationships, provide care for people, and people build bonds with providers/patients they spend time with. These bonds will cross company lines, and that’s ok.

Plenty of business to be had.

I was finding it really difficult juggling the 2 older kid’s school pick ups / activities and felt like I was missing out on everything with my 2 youngest while they went to daycare.

**Original Post:**
If my currently employer is willing to hire me through my LLC (so I’ll stay but also still be able to get all the tax benefits) - that’s a slam dunk yes, right? *In Tennessee by the way*

I make ~125k/year as a salary employer and would be giving up PTO and a 3% max match simple IRA plan BUT I’m sure you all know the benefits of being a business owner. 

I created my LLC last year but after having a kid 4 months ago, haven’t been able to do any “side work” after my 9-5, so I haven’t even tried using any tax benefits since it’s not drawing in income. 

I see this as a way to continue having a simple 9-5 job, get the tax benefits, and not have to stress about TRULY being a business owner…. Also I really need a new truck 🤣

*I do know that they save money with not having to pay benefits, but they made it sound minuscule. I had planned on asking for $5/hr more, should I aim higher? My benefits cost me $50 per pay period at the moment.

**I am the DOR and run 9 clinics - hours would never be a concern.

Last edit: I got this idea after a PT told me that he had a HH company hire him through his LLC and he writes off vehicles, utilities, dinners, an “office” space in his home, etc. But based off this thread, idk if that’s legal.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Getting patients isn’t the hard part of business owning. You’d have to be just as compliant as a 1099 contract. Especially to actually classify as a true 1099. Contractors do not get benefits. Also, questionable if you can have decision making power in your role inside the company and constitute as a 1099. 

You would be responsible for your own WC insurance, malpractice, and other insurances. You would still have to file business paperwork annually. You’d still have to have accounting software. I’m honestly not seeing the benefit of maintaining your LLC.

> **Response 2:** Having you as an independent contractor with a 1099 is a huge tax benefit for your employer, but it can screw you at tax season because you end up having to pay half the taxes that they would pay 100% of if you were a W2 employee.

Has anyone thought about a brick and mortar then decided they don’t want to manage others and deal with that headache and went the route of scaling on their own. Online classes, programs, YouTube videos, but also seeing people mobile in person as well? I’m at a crossroads and leaning toward the latter due to hiring issues I’m having! I’m barely in and already stressed with the hiring ordeal! Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started online with the intention of going brick and mortar. So glad I started this way, to avoid the headaches of overhead and being physically restricted to a space. Message me if you have questions, I'd be happy to help!

> **Response 2:** I started online, selling courses and still selling some. Then I did mobile and now have several brick and mortar and ALFs and a total of 30 employees/staff/contractors. Just really depends on what you really want to do. You want to be a therapist? Employee? Employer? Influencer? YouTuber? What is it really that you want and then go from there. Good luck and keep serving my friend.

**Original Post:**
Have you ever been worried you'll hire and train someone only for them to leave, take your clients, and leave your business hurting? 

This is a fear I hear from our clients all the time and one I've felt before. 

The reality? 

VERY few people actually WANT to be business owners. This is a hard for me to say as a coach who helps people start businesses but the reality is that most people don't want that life. They don't want the risk they just want to be able to achieve something through their career and they feel that the only way to accomplish that is by being the business owner. 

What does this mean? 

If you can find and hire someone and give them what they're actually looking for (respect, autonomy, flexibility, financial upside, etc) and they see that they can do that WHILE working for someone I can almost guarantee they won't leave. 

People don't leave to start businesses because they want to be business owners, they leave because they feel like that's their only hope to achieve  what they're looking for. Don't give them another experience to solidify that belief and they'll reward you by sticking around.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you hire an exceptional PT, (the ones whose schedules are in high demamd) and you really want them to stick around, offer a path to part ownership of the practice.  At some point, they themselves will want to become uncaged.  This is how a lot of Attorney and Medical practices operate.

> **Response 2:** No. I don’t hire anyone that crazy.

What are some strategies to deal with an employee with poor time management?
Also same employee makes careless documentation errors and they have over 5hrs of paid documentation time a week.

We've uses deadlines, lists, planner and Google calendar. 

Whenever they miss a deadline and ask why, they just simply state it was an oversight on their end. So I appreciate the accountability, we need action to accompany it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Some people need to take responsibility for their own issues.  I NEVER got paid for documentation.   Sounds like they need to grow up , become accountable.  And not get paid until their notes are done properly.

> **Response 2:** the safe approach is to handle performance issues in writing and follow a consistent process so it doesn’t look retaliatory or arbitrary. Here’s what that normally looks like:
 1. Document clearly – each time something happens, note the date, what occurred, and what policy or expectation wasn’t met. Stick to facts: actions, deadlines missed, or behaviors observed.
 2. Meet and warn – after one or two incidents, have a conversation and summarize it in writing (“verbal warning issued on X date”).
 3. Written warning – if it happens again, issue a formal notice describing the problem, the expected correction, and the possible consequences of continued issues. Have the employee sign acknowledgment (not agreement).
 4. Final warning / performance plan – outline a short period to improve (usually 30 days) with measurable goals.
 5. Termination – if there’s no improvement after documented warnings, you can end employment. Keep all documentation and communicate the decision succinctly and respectfully.

Be sure you’re following:
 • State and federal labor laws (e.g., anti-discrimination and retaliation protections).
 • Your own written policies—consistency is key to legal defensibility.
 • HR or legal counsel advice if you have it, especially before final termination.

I have my  mobile based LLC and have a home health agency reach out to contract some of their patients to me, they want to pay $75 for follow up and $100 for eval. I feel like this is very low but wanted to see what you all think. Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Way too low. I would not go below 100 for tx and 150 for eval, and that is still low. One of our Therapists in our program on the east coast just negotiated 110 for tx and 165 for eval. No oasis.

> **Response 2:** This was and still is my business model. Sometimes I negotiate depending on if the HH patient is Medicare or Medicaid and trying to be respectful to the agency who is getting paid peanuts by the state for Medicaid patients. Also can negotiate if a PT vs PTA will be seeing them. Average is PT visit/eval $95 and then I add $30 for SOC/OASIS document. I occasionally lose $ on the PT visits but make it up on the margin of a PTA visit vs pay rate

Trying to find a different way to say that we are busy to patients and we are getting so many new patients that we can’t get them in soon. Having to schedule new patients 2-3 weeks out. 

Like “we won’t have an opening until mid-may but I can put you on our cancellation list for an earlier opening. We do apologize but our patient volume is high”

Or what’s a better/more professional way to say it?

I’m so grateful of how busy I am but I don’t want it to negatively impact my practice because patients can’t get in. I am also looking to hire asap so that will help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The best way to say it without saying it is to raise prices.

> **Response 2:** A lot of times this is only viewed negatively from our lens.

Think of all the times you’ve heard a patient say “dr. Xyz is so good I couldn’t get an appointment until July”. Popular restaurants sometimes require reso weeks in advance.

Being on a waitlist or scheduling out can create demand and a sense of scarcity in the eyes of consumers. Give yourself a break (and a pat on the back), hire when you can, and preserve your boundaries and time. Very rarely is PT an emergency scenario that can’t wait a few weeks.

**Community Responses:**

Curious… I have a private cash based OP “side gig” currently. I am considering going full time. A challenge I have currently though, is when I get calls from potential clients, I explain why we are cashed based, but that we do provide a superbill that they can send in to be reimbursed if preferred. It’s usually at this point that they are no longer interested. Today I had someone say “I just know I won’t send it in.”

I am thinking of taking this part on myself if I do go full time (until I can hire admin/billing). 

I would still collect cash day of service but then submit the superbill for them (which indicates that the patient should be reimbursed). Can I do this? And if so, is there a certain way I have to do it as the provider?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would love to know this to

So I have a few days where my space is underutilized in the evenings. I had a PTA come and ask if she could rent it to do this specialized stretching thing she does on the side of working for a corporate company to make more money. She charges her pts $100/hr and wants to give me 20% of each patient she sees. She will be there after hours or on days only when  I’m not in. Thoughts on that rate and ideas on how to regulate this so I’m not getting jipped but also HIPAA complaint? She seems like a really good respectful person with a good business sense and all that jazz but I still want to protect myself etc. 

Note she will be using her own table and equipment etc. 

TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like a good deal. Maybe could move to an where she leases once she get a good amount. I do the same in my practice I subleased out for $400 first 3 months and then raise to $700 if they want exclusive use of room. If they don’t want exclusive use. I charge them $20 for 1 hour use but don’t allow them to store things there.

> **Response 2:** Not sure you need to worry about HIPAA. Is she’s just doing stretching it’s wellness and would be like someone doing personal training not a medical treatment. Unless I am misunderstanding your question.

Hello! I got my LLC and liability insurance!! Whoo hoo! 
I am a mobile PT So what would be my next immediate step to be able to see patients? Do I need my NPI? Or can I just start! 

How do you handle the payment if you don’t have a system in place yet? 

What forms are must haves? (I took the Bootcamp so there are forms somewhere correct?) 
Do I have to have an Rx from a doctor if I see PTs in MO? 
Sorry for all the questions! Just excited and nervous!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congrats! 

Get your NPI and get an EIN (tax number). I take cash and checks currently, I’m too small to pay credit card fees right now. Need consent and intake forms. Consent form you need a HIPAA or privacy policy part, consent to treatment part, financial agreement part as basic info. I think those are the most important. Highly highly advise you read your state practice act, I’m in Texas so I can’t help you there! Technically you can see people as long as you have your license up to date as well! Figure out if you want an EMR and/or how you’re going to document, get a business checking/savings and credit card set up for the LLC. Read up on Medicare participating or non participating enrollments on the page here to see if you want to go through that process as well.

Hey crew! thoughts on reaching out to patients who are once a week or once every other week…I’m mobile cash based PT. Do you reach out to check in and see how patients are doing after a session or just wait til next session? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Personally I view it as a must.  It’s an additional thing that separates you from the insurance based clinic around the corner, shows that you actually care about their rehab journey and don’t view them just as another name, and is helpful regarding exercise changes/modifications that most PTs don’t get to make until the following week.

> **Response 2:** I am not cash base but if I were i think that level a follow up would be a great idea. I am working on a telehealth job which I have yet to start but I do know they have some kind of text message system as well. There is some question on hippa compliance so I would make sure they have signed a release stating they are aware that text messaging is not secure. Were there may be a different app system you could use that is considered secure. Something to think about.

Does anybody use a mifi or portable Wi-Fi for computer work when not able to connect to other Wi-Fi’s?

Any recommendations or devices or data plan carriers?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a wireless plan for my ipad.
I have t-mobile. I've been very happy with it but it's also very different in different areas as far as coverage.

You have to make sure you have an iPad that is cellular capable. Otherwise a mifi device will work. Each carrier has them

I did not find using my phone as a  hotspot to be very reliable the other thing is when you use your phone as a  hotspot at some point it slows your speed. So if you normally get 4G or 5G or hotspot is often 1G less it depends on your carrier and plan. Plus it uses your battery a lot faster

I also found that when I would walk with my patients outside and I had my phone with me it would disconnect from the hotspot and I had to redo it and it was super annoying and I didn't want to have to think about it.
Documentation is hard enough getting it done while you're with the patient so I didn't want anything to make it harder.

> **Response 2:** I just checked into this myself last week. I have an iPad I intend to use for my documentation, but it is a Wi-Fi only device. I checked with my carrier and can add unlimited hotspot to my personal cell plan for $20 per month. This is probably the route I’m going to take. ￼

Just for fun...let's talk about some of our favorite books written by PTs!  We know there are so many books out there written about exercise and various  medical conditions, so it's really nice to see more physical therapists getting into the book writing space! 

I would love to learn more about what's out there so we can support our fellow therapists... plus it gives me something else to read to keep me off my phone!🤪

In the meantime a few I've enjoyed:

-Floored - Sara Reardon
-The Science of Stretch - Leada Malek
-The Bathroom Key - Kathryn Kassai (a bit older but was very well written)

- I'm also in the process of reading Becoming a Supple Leopard... I didn't realize he was a PT also until I started reading it.

I loathe documentation.
This has been a theme throughout my childhood ….I have always loathed assignments and homework my whole life.  Documentation feels like an extension of this. I treat one on one so I'm always left with documentation at the end of the day. (I know one on one is a gift lol)

I have been using ChatGPT to do as much of the heavy lifting as possible, by making it write patient assessments for me with this GPT

https://[chat.openai.com/g/g-C1fuXSdT4-ai-assessment-](http://chat.openai.com/g/g-C1fuXSdT4-ai-assessment-)writer-pt

hopefully it helps some of you!
Generally curious why our notes are so
monotonous and repetitive but none of us
implement any tools to get them done?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This why I use Comprehend Health to help writes my notes for me in real time as I treat. Every section of my note is completed in real time so I can focus on treating each client 100% of the time. I just check it over at the end to make sure I verbalized everything needed for my note, hit finalize, and my note is complete in seconds. I treat one-on-one as well, so it’s great knowing that as my last patient leaves I am actually done for the day, evals, daily notes, and progress notes are all done in real time. 

Chat GPT is great, but it isn’t HIPAA compliant, so you can’t use it with any real patient info. Having to jump back and forth with chatGPT and manually writing in information so it can then spit something back out, which you have to edit multiple times then copy into your EMR is even more time consuming.

> **Response 2:** Can someone give me a concrete example of how exactly you use ChatGPT or any AI to assist with documentation, assessments, SOAP notes, etc?  I understand that I can type in the search box something like “give me examples of blog posts for a physical therapy clinic” but how do you literally do it for documentation? I just can’t wrap my head around this. I am VERY new to trying to use these platforms too. TIA!

**Original Post:**
Hypermobility + running expertise?  
Do you have advice on building tension/elasticity in floppy tissues?  Available for telehealth?

Goal:  Utilize running as part of my training plan for Grand Canyon Rim-Rim-Rim (4 days with daypack) in June 2024.

Background: 
I have mild EDS and continually hurt myself running.   
I ran track & cross country in high school, but haven’t been able to run as an adult.  I’m 41.
I’m great with vertical strength — Olympic weightlifting 4 days a week is my primary exercise. 
I can hike 5-8 miles with a backpack no problem. 15-22 miles with trekking poles.  
I do advanced level Pole dancing with minimal injury 1-2 days a week. 

BUT running is elusive.  

What I’m already doing:
— Soleus & Gastroc strengthening.  Some anterior tib. 
— Loading the forefoot/toes while strength training.  
* it was all going well until last week when I had a posterior Tib flare on the right & the talus jammed up on the left.  #feelingfrustrated 
— I use the Toe Pro and Mobo board inconsistently to work medial/lateral stability.  *Lateral and rotational stability likely needs more attention. 

Barriers:  Lack of a plan & knowledge of specific variables to optimize my training.  Feedback & problem-solving support.  Accountability.  ADHD + too many hobbies.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m hypermobile and I run! I have found success with isometrics, particularly hips/glutes. Running with a metronome can help with over-striding—when you’re floppy it’s easy to over-stride, and this can place more load on the distal musculature on impact. A metronome can help you maintain a cadence and keep some co-contraction of agonists/antagonists (particularly the hips) to keep a more stable proximal base. I use a cadence of somewhere between 160-180 bpm, there are playlists on Spotify that particularly cater to these bpm’s. Hope this helps!

> **Response 2:** I don’t have any advice about running, but I did a hiking R2R a few years ago in September when I was 45 (2 nights at Phantom Ranch so only carried a day pack.)  My 2 cents- the time I put in going up and down the stadium stairs at my local high school wearing my loaded pack that summer was the most beneficial training I did. If you haven’t joined them already, there are R2R and R2R2R fb groups that offer lots of great advice for first-timers. Good luck with your training and enjoy the canyon- there are definitely moments when you need to “embrace the suck” but it is an amazing experience 😊

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

When you hire an assistant as a mobile therapist are you doing 1099 or w2?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a PT & recently hired a PTA and I was advised (due to my mentor’s lawyer’s advice) that an assistant cannot be 1099 due to them needing supervision of a therapist.  So they cannot function independently as a 1099, only employee.

> **Response 2:** I would be extremely careful about hiring as a 1099. There are both IRS and state laws regarding this and many states are becoming much more vigilant about auditing small businesses for this. I have been through an audit it is very difficulty to prove that they fit the 1099 IC route in most situations for an assistant. Please get very good legal advice on this and be prepared to face an audit on it. The penalties can be significant.

I’m sitting here renumerating… if that’s the right word trying to respond to a response to an offer I made to a PT. It would be my first W2 employee PT. I’m kind of fearful. She asked a few questions that are easy to answer and of course more money. I just keep crunching numbers and get scared I can’t afford it or the what if’s. The unknown expenses I don’t know to factor in yet. What if…. I don’t really want to split hairs. I’ve worked soooo hard to get to where I am. This is an investment that I expect to pay out at first and get my return swiftly. 

I don’t know what’s holding me back. That little nagging voice? 
A few thousand dollars on the offer 
Counter the counter ? 
It’s not a marketplace purchase its a salary 

Can anyone give me somethin? I don’t know what I need ahhhh🙄

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First, you recognize that this is an investment 👍👌

Aside from that, what is the mission for the practice? What are your goals for your employees? 
Do you want your employees to feel empowered in their roles, to be able to have creativity, to feel a sense of time freedom, to feel as though they have a measure of control?
If you allow them to experience the good that you have experienced by escaping corporate healthcare, then you will have more dedicated employees who are happy.  They, in turn, pass that along to the clients.  
The results are raving fans who become your best marketers.
And that leads to a higher ROI.
That investment “cost” ends up being a small dollar amount to you, but a very good amount for (her).

> **Response 2:** I'm kinda in the same head space right now. Need to hire someone, but scared about the investment/cost up front. Don't want to pay them too much but also not too little. I'm going 1099 route, I think. But I like all the advice here 🙂

Anyone in a cash practice offers massage or MFR sessions in their clinical practice as an additional revenue stream? 

Who provides the service? Do you have a massage therapist on staff or does the PT provide this service if the schedule is not full? 

Any legal aspects to keep in mind? Do patients fill out the same intake forms and payment agreements?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am an OT & John F Barnes Myofascial Release (JFB MFR) is my specialty. This is quite different from other forms of MFR. Lots of people specifically seek this modality especially when traditional therapy has not been successful for them. The legality of having someone working on staff will depend on the state. I operate under my OT license in a direct access state. If you're looking for providers doing JFB MFR check out MFR Insight

> **Response 2:** I have a massage therapist in my clinic - I provide her the space - she maintains her license and insurance and pays me 20% per client.  She does her own scheduling and handles her clients payments - so it is a win/win for me.  I have referred several patients to her and vice versa!

Thinking about switching to putting our intake forms on the iPad, we have like 10 pages of intake forms for all of our treatment consent forms and cancellation policy and everything. It’s been such a waste of paper and the ink/paper is expensive.

Have any of you used an iPad for intake forms and have you found your elder patients to be able to do it on there? I was worried some of them would have difficulty using it via iPad?

If I were to put the intake forms on the iPad. What app or software could I use for that?

Thanks again!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Jane app and send my intake forms prior to the appointment. If the haven’t filled it out, then I bring my iPad for them to fill it out

> **Response 2:** LOVE intakeQ ($40ish/month no contract for forms only). I just switched over and it’s so user friendly for the provider and patient. I can send the link to complete forms to their phone or email and it’s all electronic. Plus creating the forms was simple or you can pay $10/form for the system to create it for you. I opted in to their practice management software instead which is forms and scheduling/billing ($75/month no contract) just due to how simple and user friendly it is so when I schedule an eval they automatically get the intake forms and/or a zoom link for virtual clients. Plus I set it up to automatically bill the patients since I do private pay but used to use insurance so it could bill their co-pays and integrated with office ally easily. My older clients do it with a breeze! Don’t underestimate them, esp when the systems are more simplified now. Try it for free. You don’t even need to put your billing info in during the two week trial so can get a real feel for it. Love this one, Hate clinic source

I am finally creating an LLC in order to treat 2-3 patients a week. Yay! But I have so many questions. I am in Chattanooga, TN and will be treating in a dance studio. Is this the correct order of operations?
1.Get EIN
2.Form LLC
3.Register business with state 
4.File for business license in county 
5.Get liabilty insurance
6.Treat patients

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are treating in a dance studio, it's unlikely they will be seeing Medicare, so that piece might be a moot point. A few things I would add to the list, create a business bank account and get a business only debit card to make taxes much easier,  determine EMR system, create/personalize paperwork for clients - consents, patient policies, intake forms, payment forms, etc. (and remember even if you are cash only, technically you will need a Good Faith Estimate form), and create a policy manual (even if it's just you!) I have 3 studio based clinics and now we have 15 therapists total, so we definitely have to have a policy and procedure manual, but even for my own personal clinic that is just me, I have a document that lists out all my policies -- like cancellation policy for patients, termination policy for patients that aren't a good fit, when I'll do my inventory, how I'll disburse my payments to myself etc. It's one page for my practice, but its helpful to keep me on track! Good luck!

Hi!
Just signed the lease on my first brick and mortar space! Yay!
Cash practice + in network with Medicare, so will need a EMR that will support me doing my own billing for MCR and creating superbills for cash people who want to submit on their own for reimbursement. 

So far I am between Jane and Prompt. Anyone have thoughts? I am looking to keep costs low since it’s just me.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Prompt! I never had to worry about billing. Very easy to use. Keep an open mind, especially with the price. But it sure is worth every penny. 

And hi! I’m in Queens, NY!

> **Response 2:** I’m in the same boat as you Danielle Danielle Weis.  If Prompt could just come down in price during the early phases I would go for that.  I do like Jane’s Part Time Plan to keep overhead down. I’m interested to see what the group has to say.

For my mobile providers: do you find yourself constantly messing with your schedule to try and keep drives close together as possible, then you DC someone and get someone new who now lived 20 mins the other way and you’re shuffling things all over (and also feel bad for switching current patient’s times)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely some schedule management. I have 2 different zones, one area M/W, then second area Tues/Thursday that are reasonably close to each other. I do my best to predict, but occasionally ask a patient to slide up or down to avoid zig zagging around town...but I always look a week ahead to prep for that. There are patients that have standing times too. Most are reasonable! I've found I'm able to route decently to be timely, but I do call if I'm more than 5 minutes off.

> **Response 2:** I group and schedule my patients by geographic location. I will even explain this to them during the scheduling process so they understand and none of them have complained at all about it. 

If you think about when you go to the doctor, you just have to take whatever is available. If a patient really wants the service it's not going to make or break you unless of course you only have  an 8:00 a.m. or a 5:00 p.m. or something like that. 

Even with the best laid intentions I have had patients who are 5 minutes away from each other and one has a last-minute doctor appointment and I can't group them together which is frustrating. But it definitely gets easier when you set your boundaries!   

And to make things easier I actually do my schedule only one week at a time. That way I don't waste time moving things around.  Pretty much at the end of their last visit of the week I then go over the schedule for the following week and I put them on. I try to keep their times pretty consistent, just to make scheduling easier.  And I don't allow them to schedule, since I need full control of the calendar based on the geography. 😁

I actually have two patients right now who live in a neighborhood 30-35 minutes away. That is very far for me but they are both cash pay patients. But I made it very clear to them that because of the distance I have to see both of them on the same day. And they both are fine with it!

This one says that it is only 24# but some reviews say that it isn’t much of a difference between other tables. 



**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a light lite, it’s a chiro table, so a bit narrower, but I put a hole in my massage table after doing a manip. It’s light weight and has a back pack carry case

> **Response 2:** I have an aluminum table and it broke when a patient jumped on the table😬

My aunt has some notably arched feet from her cerebral palsy. We have been trying so hard to find her "princess shoes" that might stay on her feet, but we keep striking out. Anyone have any suggestions?

Side note: she spends most of her time seated (wheelchair or otherwise), so we don't have to worry about her having to walk in them.

There are two ditches on both sides of the road to avoid when growing your business:

Left ditch - "I can figure it out on my own." That is fueled by pride/ego and can get us in trouble. It's always healthiest to stay open to learning at all times. 

Right ditch - Over-consuming all information that you can get your hands on. Many people read books and absorb information that isn't helpful in the stage of business they are in, and steers them away from implementation of the right things. 

The heart of this post comes from hearing many people tell me that they have pre-ordered Alex Hormozi's $100M Leads. Every book he puts out is fantastic, no doubt...BUT here is the question I ask each time: Is that what you NEED to be reading to get you to your next level of growth?

If not, be disciplined enough to pick up the RIGHT book.
So, why is this important?

Because I've literally seen practice owners who REALLY just need to hire another PT, pick up a book like that and get side tracked for MONTHS because they are trying to implement the wrong thing.

That book at the RIGHT time for the RIGHT business, Im sure will be exceptional, but really the PT in the example above just needs to focus on hiring, and learning how to do so properly.

Stay on the road at all costs! Don't get distracted and veer yourself off the road only to realize months later how far you have gone off the road. 

You can do this! This is just my reminder to stay focused and avoid the two ditches.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Comparison is how Satan works in business…especially for believers. He knows we naturally have desires to have more or do more. When we think we need more or something different comparison starts to run our business and gets us off track

Hi all, Looking for reviews of prompt emr specifically .. opening a mobile PT practice focusing on vestibular and neuro clients, cash and Medicare. If anyone has a similar practice and uses prompt your input would be so helpful!.. Did a demo but also looking to hear from actual people who use it too (is it worth the cost). Also, Does anyone also use it for wellness visits/ memberships? Any negatives?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started with HENO with my mobile practice. I looked at prompt and liked it, but the time and cost of moving the data held me back. Prompt is really nice if you are planning on scaling, but for me HENO does everything I need it to do and costs less. I’m happy to share my referral link if interested in HENO.

> **Response 2:** I participate with insurance; In a nutshell- I switched from WebPT to Prompt and switched back to WebPT.  Each system has their pros and cons.  For me, WebPT is very responsive and knows their system and has an IT department and staff that knows their system and can easily figure out things.

I own an in home personal training business for seniors in which I provide therapy inspired exercises (private pay). I’m ready to hire and need any help/advice I can get on hiring a 1099 employee. I’ve gathered that they need to fill out an agreement, a non compete, and a w9 form. Anything else? Also, should I write up the agreement or do I need a lawyer to do so? Any other other advice is welcome!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Before you move ahead, please understand that a '1099' is a form you issue to any contractor for whom you paid more than $600/year so they can report it on their taxes. (This law is if you're in the USA)

If you're looking for an employee, it's not the same as a '1099'.

By the sounds of what you're looking to do, you probably cannot have independent contractors because the workers will be an integral part of your business.

Here's a blog post that might help understand about the difference between ICs and employees. 

(Ask me how I know!)🤦‍♀️

https://www.irenediamond.com/are-you-an-really-ic-or-employee

> **Response 2:** As a current 1099 employee, I wouldn’t sign anything with a non compete. My feeling as an independent contractor is I should be able to work for whoever, whenever I want. If you want me to sign a non compete than make me a W2 employee so I don’t get killed in taxes and give me benefits.

It's time for my business to scale and grow....

Wanting to connect with other who have treaded these waters, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

I’ll stay PRN PTA because I still love that as well. My plan is to offer strength training as well as hands on manual work as needed. I’m hoping to add Yoga and Nutrition to my services in the future as well. I want to have a full wellness business that offers in-home services for people who have trouble leaving their homes or just want more convenience.

> **Response 2:** Yes, but curious why you want all working independently as a “collective”, and not hire these at employees all working for the same business?

For mobile cash-based practices using Google docs, how are you sending POC to docs and having the patient fill out paperwork prior to eval?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Google Forms for consent forms. 
If I need to set a plan of care to the physician, I use Google docs. I wish there was a way they could sign electronically but they have to print it out, sign and refax. 

If anyone has an easy workaround for this, I would love to know. I use 
Faxage, it's 3.49 a month and then I think you pay for extra pages

> **Response 2:** I email them the forms to print and fill out at home.   If they don't have a printer, I'll bring it on the first visit and have them fill it out before 2nd visit  

I have made templates for evals on Google sheets and fax those for POC.

**Original Post:**
My clinic uses JaneApp and has a 50% cancellation fee for no shows/ cancellations with less than 24 hours.  Patients sign twice agreeing to the policy on intake (once with a line that’s all by itself, and another among the long legal payment agreement).  They also get a cx policy reminder on each appointment reminder email… yet people are still shocked when it comes into play.

Generally if someone is actually sick/ emergency, we do not charge, just remind them of the policy but say this is an exception.  Also, if it’s less than 24 hours, but is the day before the appointment, the first time we also don’t charge, just remind them of the policy.

Is this a universal experience of clients being surprised/ upset by the fee? My Jane customer service person said that I have the cx policy on my documentation more than average… and I don’t want it to be too excessive to annoy the vast majority of clients who are very considerate of our small business.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wr are having this experience and it’s so frustrating. It’s in our intake forms at least 3 times (and very obvious) and we talk about it on the first appointment. Yet we have people call us and complain or argue when they see they were charged for their cancel or no shows. We are also 1:1 and it’s a whole hour of missed work for the business and therapist. It’s so challenging!

> **Response 2:** I have a “1 Freebee” rule where I waive it the first time and we have a very direct conversation along the lines of “sure I don’t mind cancelling but just be aware we do have a 24 hour cancellation policy. We will waive it this time but going forward there will be a charge of $xx”. I note it in their chart and honestly it either doesn’t happen again or there’s no argument.

I'm doing some research on potentially hiring my first PT here in California. It seems like according to CA law, PTs can't be classified as independent contractors. Is this correct? **Have any practice owners in CA hired therapists as independent contractors?** I wanted to hire independent contractors and have them function as PRNs, i.e. setting their own hours and choosing who they want to see. But I need to make sure it's legally sound to bring them on as 1099s instead of W2s.

(The law I'm referring to is AB5 and became effective in January 2020)

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cannot 1099 in CA under most circumstances.  

Can if it’s something you do not usually or customarily offer. 
But go W9 it’s essentially the same thing.  So bring on a PT that has incorporated themselves and you’re good.   They assume their own liability and risk and insurance etc.  but at that point you become a staffing agency so to speak.

> **Response 2:** I did a lot of research on this too before I hired my first PT in CA, and everything I found pointed to making them a W2 employee. Hope this helps!

Does anybody have any thoughts on using PTEverywhere vs. Jane?  I signed up for PTEverywhere but the system they use for billing is so much more expensive than what I use currently and the point of signing up with PTE was to save myself time and effort and be able to have more time for treating etc. But I can't switch billing systems and pay even more, so now I'm not saving time or effort.  So I'm curious of the comparison of the 2 in general and if Jane's billing system is reasonable with fees - I do all of my processing online and not in person with a card reader. 

Any thoughts on that and on the usability and friendliness of either system and on the costs of it in general would be super helpful!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We switched to PTE last year. Unless they change some things in the coming year or so we are out. We are self pay so the billing isn't an issue. Their reports and systems aren't all that flexible and don't do as much as I'd like

> **Response 2:** I only accept self pay, but I love Jane! Super easy to learn and their customer service is quick and really helpful when I have had questions.

Thoughts on asking a credit card to be kept on file (with a non cancelation policy) on a cash business? Trying to “nip” no shows and/or last minute cancelations.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A credit card on file is required at the PT practice my daughter goes to, my dermatologist and our dentist require one. It’s pretty standard these days of privately owned medical practices.

> **Response 2:** We collect the card and there is now a 1 page cancellation policy. Be prepared for people to be pissed. I honestly would rather weed those people out and get them off my schedule because they are the ones that are the habitual late cancels and no shows. To me it’s disrespectful of the therapist, business owner, and other patients time (which is what my cancel policy says). With that I do usually tell people they get a one time freebie and next time the policy will apply.

Discussion topic: 
Pros and cons of-
Owning your own business without benefits provided. 
Working full time for a company with benefits in a clinic.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻 what they said!  Never asking anyone for time off is better than any other benefit I could think of.  I could never go back!

> **Response 2:** Risk and Reward. 
Reward= No ceiling/unlimited earning potential, lifestyle freedom. 
Risk= not succeeding and making less $ than working for someone, never being truly “off” from work. 
Being on your own isn’t as glamorous as the masses may think. Comes with a lot of stress and liabilities, but in the end, it’s the only way for some.

What are your thoughts regarding EMR software Jane?

**Community Responses:**

Hello! I am just getting started with an all cash based mobile side hustle and have a couple of questions that I would love some help with.
1). Recommendations for best user friendly and low cost EMR service for record keeping
2). From a billing standpoint, what are typical rates for eval/follow ups. Planning on seeing clients for hour long sessions. And I am based in Florida. 

Any and all help is much appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love Jane, and my patients love it. Very nice that my patients can book online, and get appointment reminders. My online booking site looks very professional. I have several elderly patients who are able to use it 😊

> **Response 2:** I did a demo with a few different ones and picked Jane App. Halaxy is free but is bare bones but a step above G suite. Jane App is not set up well to automate any Medicare compliance which is a huge downside.

Hi! My clinic is skilled OT/PT and wellness. I will be offering yoga, meditation, massage, etc. I do not want to track any of that on my EMR. I am looking for an app or a site where clients can go in pay for their class/package and show up to class. If you offer wellness services, what do you use to track and sell visits/packages.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** One of the wellness studios wheee I work uses Mind Body. I like it, but I’m not sure how much it costs. It also allows clients to schedule themselves if you choose.

> **Response 2:** I use Jane and separate wellness services from PT services. So while Jane does serve as my EMR for PT, I can turn off note requirements for wellness services and track all packages etc independently

I offer personal training as well as physical therapy for my
business. Should I document my personal training sessions?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** While not legally required to, I document a visit happened, and 2-3 sentences of what happened. 

Usually any major data points I have invented for the client: 30 min walking distance, weight vest laps around living environment, time to do complete 50 sit to stands, etc 

Main reason I do this is to be a better trainer and remember benchmarks as well as tax purposes to deduct driven miles for each session.

> **Response 2:** When I did personal training, I had a simple chart with all the exercises down the side and dates across the top. In each column, I recorded weight, #reps, time under load. ￼ at the very bottom of the column, you could write any significant notes (like where you focused on technique, tolerance, etc.).  This way you have a record and are tracking progress easily. ￼

I was approached by a home health care company to treat Medicare pts for them as a a 3rd party contractor or they are looking into options at the very least. I have a cash pay practice and not really interested in doing OASIS SOC evals and what not. 

I'm leaning towards passing on the opportunity but was wondering would they even be able to pay me as a 3rd party? 

That seems to open a can of worms and possibly cause more issues for me, my staff, etc. Thanks for your input!

**Original Post:**
Hello all. 

Looking for PTs in Detroit Michigan. 

I saw this post on one of FB groups. This woman is in her 50s and started lifting not too long ago. She said she had not so great experience with the previous PT. Hopefully this one will be much better!

Here is her post: 
"Some background & specs: 52, 5’6”, 130lbs. (This is the genetic body type of both sides of my family).  Type 2 Diabetes. Very sensitive to carbs and trying to manage blood sugar & menopause without medication & through fitness as much as I can (not against other options). History of frozen shoulder (completely healed at this point) and chiropractic issues that are manageable and come less frequently now. 

I’ve been working with a fitness trainer (male) who seems to “get it” and is open.  I have a chiropractor (male) who I’ve seen on and off for over 20 years. Has helped a lot and I respect his knowledge.  The book “Next Level” has inspired almost all the lifestyle changes I’ve made.  I was not an “athlete” before this book.  Very stagnant life before. Very weak. 

Began weight training in March 2023 after a 2month recovery from a slip n fall & minor car accident.  As of last week, I squat 95lbs and about 15-20lbs for most arm bb. (Still learning all the gym language.) my focus is to maintain a healthy fat/muscle ratio to manage blood sugar & train to manage menopause.  I feel great! Blood sugar down from 10 A1C to 7 A1C (hoping to get it lower). Very few menopause symptoms.  Still really carb sensitive so I don’t get all my carbs in daily, increased fat but not doing Keto. Shared my current macros. They are going up gradually to accommodate my blood sugar.  

(Feel free to offer any suggestions) 

My issue: last week I was doing pushups and pulled something in my neck.  Was having some same side lower back/hip pain during hinge exercises, too.  Saw the chiropractor who fixed the issue and said the following “With your posture and frame you should lift lighter with more reps(🙄). Don’t lift over head.  Do exercises that keep your chest open. Women over 50 are at higher risk for shoulder injury during weight training.” (Admittedly, was hoping for, you look great, posture is stronger…kudos, kudos, kudos)

I’m finding myself comparing all I’ve learned and experienced since picking up “Next Level.” Wanting to consider all the respected perspectives.  I know I have a long way to go. I’m still deciphering Dr. Stacy Sims recommendations and applying. 

I respect everyone’s experience and perspective here.  Hoping for information, perspective and inspiration that will keep me motivated and moving forward.  (Don’t worry, Ill take everything offered in context of it being FB) Thanks."

Any takers?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Melanie Eplin is in Detroit, I believe

> **Response 2:** Can't think of anyone offhand, but I really hope someone helps her cement better narratives into her brain than what that chiro had to offer her!!

Someone help this go-getter continue to get after it.

Does anybody use an app or anything to keep track of the random tasks that come up? Right now we use just paper and highlight when things get done. But obviously my co-owner and I both can't see what is done unless we meet. Just want to make our lives easier in the long run. 

Also. Thanks for everyone's input on my last post about a month ago. Was losing my mind. Busy! Which is great! But so stressed out with all the random day to day, month and long term tasks that I was losing my mind.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ohhhh I see you stole my patented method 🤣🤣🤣🤪🤪

Happy Tuesday everyone! 

Just doing a little updating on procedures around the office and making check lists/how to lists in preparation for hiring an office manager! 

When it comes to creating a paper chart for patients to keep on record what all do you put in yours?

What are some other things that would be good to make ”how to” cheat sheets for them to refer back to?

Chart audit check list?
Submitting claims ?

Let me know! TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Basic contact info, signed policies and procedures, HIPAA, consent signatures. Copy of DL & insurance cards. I can send you my original paper intake paperwork that I made from David with uncaged and my revised versions from my billing team! 🥰

WebPT makes a patient onboarding checklist that is handy for gathering all needed info! 

I would also recommend typing out example verbiage for them to follow when answering phone calls, scheduling, new patient onboarding so they sound professional and hit all the major things while on the phone!

Happy to send you copies of any of my papers ❤️

> **Response 2:** Nope. No paper. Scan. Shred.  Cloud.

Has anyone created an app? There are so many options out there; any insight to what you used would be helpful! Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What all do you want the app to do? I used PT Wired and have really loved the results.

> **Response 2:** Completely depends on what job you want the app to solve. We built our own EMR application, Embark EMR , using a system called caspio. Caspio provides a HIPAA compliant database and security infrastructure, connected with a (fairly) simple development environment. However, for the HIPAA compliant database and security system, it does cost about $10,000 per year.

If so, what ￼￼do you like or not like about it? It looks and sounds like a great platform from others I’ve spoken to who use it.

I’m seriously ￼￼considering switching over to them since I’m having major issues with current EMR. 

Happy Friday!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love it and my patients all rave about using it. I don’t do insurance so can’t speak to that piece. But I specifically got because it does so much for me that I don’t have time for/adhd wise it’s too overwhelming so I absolutely love it. I link the payments, i click click click and Superbills are sent. Can upload files in hippa compliant manner. Only downside is you can’t fax - which I rarely need but it would be nice and easy

> **Response 2:** I use it and love it. I agree with everything above. I also really love how customizable notes are - you can make your templates exactly like you want them, and add anything extra you need on the fly during the visit - but without being clunky. I’ve used WebPT at a previous job and you could always add areas to type, but it was so clunky and ugly. On that note - that is one of my favorite things about janeapp - it’s pretty. I probably shouldn’t care about that, but I do, and I appreciate that they care about it too.

Hi again - the patient I posted about the other day saw the surgeon today. TKA July 21st. Lacking 10-12 degrees extension and has ~100 degrees flexion. 

Surgeon said he is doing good and no manipulation needed 😳

Should he get a second opinion?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is he able to take NSAIDs? I’ve had issues with patients with cardiac histories who aren’t able to take NSAIDs making it tough to manage swelling and pain

How do you guys hire/find new PT's? I live in a smaller town, close to a huge city, about an hour away. But If I could, I could hire 4-5 more PT's based on how busy we are. But It is so hard to find anyone right now. I've done job fairs but that's more long term Investing In hiring someone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you take students?  That might be a nice way to train and recruit future therapists get awareness for your practice.

> **Response 2:** When recruiting therapists, no matter where, active recruiting is a must. 

So not just posting a job and hoping/waiting for applicants. Getting a licensure list from your state which usually will include emails (and hopefully phone numbers), emailing, texting, calling to those is the zip codes close to you. 

Posting on social media/linkedIn. 

Get in touch with the local PT schools in your area and try and connect with those last year PT students. 

Differentiating your job when you post it. Highlight the reasons someone would want to work for you. Also don’t list every duty/the entire job description in the post. It’s not necessary and no one reads it. 

It’s so important to get back to applicants the same day and set up an interview asap. Then make a decision quickly.

I have a brick and mortar business. About 1/2 cash and 1/2 Medicare. 14 sessions pay my basic bills. 20, my “booked” number pays taxes, vacation time, emergency fund, continued education fund… 
I’ve been working home health 3 days a week (18 units, which I share between 4 days), and been averaging 11-13 sessions a week for the last couple weeks. And then I suddenly got 5 initial evaluations next week. 3 Medicare, 2 cash. 2 are posture/scoliosis based (which I usually do 2 to 3 times a week at first to obtain best results)… All word of mouth. Zero marketing. At most a social media post a week. People just like my results.
in addition, 1 former patient is returning for new problems. I expect to be booked at 20 for next at least 4-5 weeks… with likely waitlist. 
I am ok keeping 20 + 18 units of HH for a month or 2, but not much longer. I also need to give 4 weeks notice at HH to cash my PTO.
So question is, at what point it is “safe” to call it quit on the HH side?
I am scared of calling it on HH and then suddenly go back to 12 sessions a week in a few months

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you're really worried stay on with home health but as a PRN employee or an independent contractor. You don't want to sacrifice your business for home health and it sounds like you have some really good opportunities. Plus word of mouth is huge! It's how I get a lot of my returning patients

> **Response 2:** Great job! You are clearly doing an amazing job! I would go atleast another 90 days with your HH and Brick and mortar and then resign with the 4 week notice from HH. Worse case scenario you switch to prn with HH and or sign up with another prn company in the event you’re unable to fill your brick and mortar caseload.

I’m really starting to get frustrated with my current EMR. I’ve tried to stick with it and be patient, but lately the issues we’re running into are taking months to resolve. I’m nervous about switching, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s time.

For those of you who’ve made the leap, what ultimately made you decide to switch? Any advice or things you wish you knew before changing systems?

What system did you change from and too and was it worth it? 

Costs are big thing as I am a soleproneur but saving time is also key.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use hello note. Very inexpensive and customer service is on top of it with any issues. Not a lot of problems and very user friendly. Also has a billing platform built in.

> **Response 2:** We switched from WebPT to Prompt. WebPT became too glitchy with lost documentation in the middle of a note, at one point frequent outages which may now be fixed. 
We are with Prompt now, I wish I would have looked at more but the ease of documentation was unmatched. It is more expensive, with hidden “add on” purchases including an automatic fax button at the end of notes. But at the end of the day, the transition was smooth. Very user friendly. And therapists are happy with the features. The billing system is very user friendly. 
May consider switching to something cheaper in the future.

Anybody have EMR recommendations that can be used offline for mobile outpatient practice? A good 15-25% of my target demographic has little to no cell service (rural CO). I serve this area now for home health and ability to document offline is literally a make or break feature.

**Community Responses:**

I’d love to hear any ideas for Christmas gifts for PTs on your team! (I have one PT who works a few hours a week, and would like to spend around $100).   Because of other time commitments, a nice dinner or company outing/ experience isn’t in the cards for them, otherwise that would be my first choice. 
Thank you!!

(I give a check for other occasions through the year, so loooing for gift ideas rather than money)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A nice hand written letter and cash is what I always give my team! I put the thought into my words, not as much the gift. Lol They are able to put the money to whatever they want / need. I put this into my budget to essentially give a really nice Christmas bonus. It’s personally what I would want! 😊

How do business owners take vacations?
I own a home health therapy staffing company and work 6 days per week. I haven't taken a vacation in 5 years and can't wrap my head around how I could actually make it happen without paying someone to do cover the admin, which would also require paid training. That's a very expensive vacation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s also very expensive if you burn out and have health issues and can’t run your company. I encourage you to find a way to take care of yourself. I know this doesn’t answer your question but as someone with chronic health issues I know the importance of this.

> **Response 2:** I will take thurs night-sun night ones…its long enough for me n minimally impacts patient care

Luna PT question as I know there’s a lot of you who do Luna part time and I’m waiting on approval of my post on the LinkedIn group:

Hi! PT near Boston here. I live on the edge of the city so all of my patients so far have been in the suburbs with easy parking. I just got assigned a patient where it appears there’s no parking within at least half a mile. I am trying to figure out the logistics of this. I could also easily take the train and walk a half mile or so but that’s not feasible with the table. Would love to connect with other PTs practicing in urban areas to understand what you do in these situations. Do you:

1. Park the half mile (or however far) away and do the walk with your table 
2. Set the expectation with the patient that due to their unique circumstances (keeping it vague to protect privacy), you cannot bring the table
3. Factor in walking time from the car with the table and let the Luna team know if this total commute time is out of range 
4. Other 

I already tried to contact the Luna team to get more info on parking so please don’t suggest this! I plan to call the patient to discuss further but curious as to what I should say if my research and knowledge of the area is correct that there isn’t parking within at least half a mile.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely factor in your time and I wouldn’t bring the table. I actually hardly bring my table around at all because I find that the patients do better if I just show them how to do exercises at home using what they have.

> **Response 2:** Thanks for the suggestions, all! I spoke with the patient and they are totally fine not having the table.

Been seeing a lot of folks talking about Prompt lately. Anyone know if it’s actually worth switching to? And how’s the pricing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I personally hated it and ALL of my coworkers did too. I am not sure if it was the implementation from my old company but it felt choppy, had too many screens and made it difficult for me to follow my thoughts on the patient. When i covered other clinics I couldn't even tell what was actually going on with the patient. Again, the implementation could have been poor in my old job but we had PTs quit over it.

> **Response 2:** Prompt is good but when you start their add ons. It is expensive check out SelfDocAIMR much cheaper and a does more.

Finally made the plunge and begin the process! I am so excited to see where this year takes me, but feel so lost as to what I really need to do in the process besides just get a tax ID #, make a name, begin marketing and really getting my name out there, in addition to finding a space to get started. 
How did you all begin? is there a checklist you followed, podcasts you listened too? I'm ready to make and learn from my mistakes but would love to make it as smooth of a process as possible so please share with me what you all have learned along the way!
Super EXCITED:) CAN'T BELEIVE I AM FINALLY DOING THIS.

Just some PSAs for y'all.

- Stay active in your local groups. Especially ones where people are frequently connecting with each other ("who do you use for hair/nails/doctor/dentist/PT/gym/personal training").

- Connect with people who are doing things like what you do. They will advocate for you! AND now you know people to refer out to when you're not the right fit.

- Plan WAYYYYY in advance for who to hire and how to hire. I just got 6 new evals because of one connection, and it's going to swamp my schedule. And I am not prepared to hire -- learn from my mistake. 🫠

Keep on truckin', y'all.

Second post, sorry y’all! 
Do you offer any paternity leave? We haven’t had to deal with any maternity and paternity yet, but as our clinicians are starting to grow their families this question has come up a few times. I know ultimately it’s our decision on what we do, but just seeing what other companies are doing/offering. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve never (17 yrs as a PT) worked for a company that offered paid parental leave, just STD + PTO or unpaid leave. I’ve always resented that. My husband isn’t in healthcare and gets 3wk 100% paid leave.. his company breaks it down that both parents get 3wk for “family bonding” and this can be used for any situation - adoption, birth, etc. The birthing person gets an additional 9wk paid leave for “physical recovery”, so 12 wk total for them. 

Paid leave is the right thing to do for both parents, and (sadly) offering this would set you apart from the rest of the healthcare field. I know you’re probably a small company, and it really should be the big orgs that are doing this, but if you can, please offer it!

> **Response 2:** I think it’s hard for any employer to do this, but my personal opinion is that at least partially covering paid parental leave is the right thing to do and you’ll have a more loyal staff because of it. Family first.

Hi Everyone! Just wanted to see if anyone was familiar with good sites/platforms to build and support online courses/programs. Building out some online content/courses that would include videos and pdfs. I've heard of Podia and Kajabi and Squarespace courses (my website platform). User friendly is ideal (this stuff is not my forte), affordable, and bonus if there is a supporting phone app. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Squarespace for mine and it’s worked out really well and was much more cost-effective than the other platforms

> **Response 2:** I use Kartra but if I had to do it again I’d choose Kajabi since it has an app.

I have an LLC and I’m a SLP looking into Payment methods for clients I am private pay only 
Do you all use Venmo ? I was told the biz acct is not hippa compliant however I offer classes to organizations and centers in my area 
Would this be an instance where I could use Venmo ? As I’m not exchanging sensitive info 
For private therapy and Eval’s obviously a no due to hippa 
Any info would be appreciated thanks 
Also what other forms of payments do the private pay clinicians take with low fees ?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why does a payment need to be HIPAA compliant ?
I use business venmo and Business paypal for my private people it goes through my EMR. You sign a business agreement

> **Response 2:** I use theraplatform (I’m an SLP, PLLC). It’s li led to stripe. . I love this platform for scheduling, invoicing, and payments. And help/support is awesome.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** I use the scheduling software Acuity, and there’s a text and email reminder option. My clients LOVE it. I gets comments about it all the time.

Anyone have success or experience using Hello Note for their EMR system? I am looking into the "Pay as you go" per note concept as I am doing a small side hustle. They wouldn't go over pricing for that program unless I talked with a sales representative.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been using Hellonote for over five years. I would definitely not do the paper method for multiple reasons. Or Google forms. There’s lots of different pricing options pending on your business set up and what you want to do. I know the lack of clear pricing is a frustration for many, but it does depend on your set up and they will help you figure out what’s best for your practice. There’s also various discounts that you can get as well.￼ they also have different tiers depending on what type of business you have, and what kind of assistance he would like to have.

> **Response 2:** I know Mike Chua loves Hello Note

Good iPhone apps for HEP???? I normally use HEP2go but it’s not mobile friendly. I need something I can do on my phone and send to patients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not necessarily a physical therapy app but true coach works well. the coach/clinician uses a desktop version and the patient/athlete sees it through a mobile version with demo videos

> **Response 2:** Haven’t found one that’s optimal for phone. 

Physiapp is clunky and search on the iPhone seems to output different results than on the computer. 

MedBridge app doesn’t allow building programs. Have to use web app. 

Switchback works but it’s all your own videos that you load.  There is not a default library. 

I use prehab guys exercise library right now. Hoping they create an app at some point for it but the exercises are on par with what I do. 

Haven’t tried the others mentioned here yet

My office is running smoothly, we have all the systems in place, we love our jobs.  But want to make sure my employees feel seen, supported, encouraged to continue to develop, etc.  Would love all your ideas and what you have implemented. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In the past when I was a manager, we would also anonymously write down on a little piece of paper when an employee goes above and beyond.  Employees would write about other employees.  And after several months, we would give those comments to the employees who were written about.  People loved that. ￼

> **Response 2:** Celebrating employee birthdays and work anniversaries seems like a no brainer but many places don’t do anything.  I think it makes a difference

Can I create an LLC and sign a contract with a Home Health agency with said LLC? 

I want to start a Mobile PT side hustle and eventually quit my 9-5 BUT I an opportunity to do PRN HH has opened up and I figured I’d be good experience outside of my typical director position. Would love to create an LLC and show some income coming in ASAP just not sure how this works! 

Thanks guys!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Some home health companies will hire your LLC as a staffing company. So if you have PTAs who you can hire under your LLC as 1099s you can offer the agency PT staffing from eval to DC by your staffing company.  Then you can make a little bit off each visit done by your PTAs. In Florida all you need is to get a Health Care Services Pool license. $600 every two years.

I’m trying to choose an EMR and loved my demo with hellonote but see that people were having trouble recently with the updates to the system.  Any feedback on that? Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been using it for over 5 years and we have several therapists in our therapy business builder program who use it.  What type of business?

> **Response 2:** I overall really like hellonote but yes very slow. Every time I needed to knock out a handful of notes it would be so slow and take for ever. But other times I can knock out a whole day's worth of notes in like 5 mins. And. I was real hopeful that I could use it on a tablet during sessions but it did not work well at all. Maybe my tablet was too old...anyone able to use it on their tablet? If so what tab do you have?

How many of you offer 401(k) with 100% company matching?

My business only has three employees including myself. I’m just not sure if it’s something reasonable to offer or am I putting myself over my head?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Simple IRA with 3% match. Comes with Roth or traditional contribution option. Cheaper than 401k, but does have lower contribution limits in comparison.

> **Response 2:** I never knew of a Company matching 100%. That can amount to tens of thousands of dollars.....

So I am doing some per diem this week at an out patient facility near me for coverage. Finally got access to emr to check case load and I like to look at notes ahead of time. Every patient gets a HP and stim. And we wonder what’s wrong with our profession still.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I legit got kicked out of a clinic as a travel PT bc I wasn't doing heat AND ice stim combo on EVERYONE (beginning and end of session). The owner pulled me aside and told me to do it but I told him that I will 100% use it if it's indicated AND if patient requests . 90% of my patients said they didn't really feel like they needed it so I didn't use it. I mean, this was also the clinic that told me to just clock out so the aid can take care of a patient while I was on lunch break. So I didn't really care much about that job. It was horrible

> **Response 2:** Are the patients happy?

> **Response 1:** I do a lot of tactile and manual cueing for biofeedback as well s the use of mirrors. Kgoal is also another device I've used that allows the patient to see thru the app how their breathing for downtraining/relaxation and also strength training. It connects to the IPAD so its awesome:)

> **Response 2:** MR 30 but I don’t use the software, just the device

My understanding is when starting my own cash based PT practice, I will need an NPI type 2. Correct me if I’m wrong ☺️ When applying for a type 2 NPI (I already have a type 1), do I select an employee of the organization? Or a surrogate working on behalf of the organization? Just want to make sure I get this right. ￼￼

Which EMR system is similar to Square Appointments?! 

I am strictly cash rate based and don't bill. I keep hand written notes. Google docs for Superbills. I love that square sends reminders and i can do the App for easy access. 

I have contractors working out of space that I would want them to have access to my schedule + notes when I'm not available+ vice versa. 

I know people really like Jane App, are there any salon/spa liek software that is HIPAA compliant

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m pretty sure if you’re not billing you’re not required to be hippa compliant.  Though I’m sure you’ll still take client privacy safely. 

I use square for payments, Setmore for appt scheduling, mailer lite for email marketing, google docs for intake, and the notes app for client notes.  I save notes to my google drive

> **Response 2:** Massage book is linked to square and can do everything your talking about. Also check with your liability insurance, they may offer something free as well. 
I’m also looking for something different. So far I haven’t needed anything more but I know I will soon.

Hello! We are hiring our first employee for admin work (answering calls, scheduling, verifying insurnace, etc). 

Looking if anyone has any tips and tricks for making it a smooth process or anything you used to help as this will be a remote position. 

I will still be taking over some of the admin duties part of the day and then our employee we are hiring will be working the later half of each day.

Not exactly sure what I’m looking for, but just want to see how others handle this as I’m putting together some training resources and envisioning how everything will work between sharing duties split between the hours of the day. 

TIA! ☺️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi! I manage our admin Team. If this will be remote position, you'll need to set the tone for productivity and priorities from day 1. I also recommend them coming in a day or couple of shifts during the week if possible.

The greatest impact that one can have is keeping your schedule full.. time is of the essence. I call it the window of opportunity. If a patient no shows, cancels, or says they'll have to call back to schedule. They go on a call list.. calls need to be made the next day, then the very next day. If we wait until a week after their missed appointment, then the likelihood of them getting back on the schedule drops by 70%.

Referrals called same day, then the next day. Same window of opportunity applies.

These call back and referral lists should be on a spreadsheet shared via secured server so that you can see real time updates. Calls should be made at the best times. Before 9AM and after 5PM. Why? That is when people answer because that is when they are off from work.

Authorizations should be kept on a log as well with approval/denial status and visits/date range approved.

Schedule a weeks worth of appointments at a time.

Send eval/progress note updates to referring providers weekly to keep them informed and your business front and center (out of sight out of mind).

Give little bonuses/incentives for clinic growth. "If we increase by __% of visits, or if we average ___ visits for the month, then we'll give___" or "If you schedule __% of referrals that came in you get___"

Lastly, invest in remote work tools:

Ring Central so they can send and recieve faxes via email.

VOIP phone service to make and take calls from a number linked to your business. Look for an option that will provide call logs and volume so you can see how much or how little they have on their plate.

I always look for people with previous Medical office experience, sales is a plus. Must have excel, outlook, MS office experience.

Congratulations on your growth! 🙌

> **Response 2:** Hey Amanda congrats on the growth. We employ a ton of admins for practices across the country. 

Big keys. Make sure you define success. What metrics/KPIs drive this position and how will you measure success. 

Make sure you have all of your log ins and scripts/SOPs in one location so that it is very easy for the admin to access. 

I find that measuring hours can be very difficult for a virtual admin so often times paying then a flat rate for a set of hours or tasks often work at the best.

I've always offered complimentary discovery calls, but I'm going to hire an admin soon so I'll be shifting that responsibility to them. For other people who have made that transition, do you still call them discovery calls? I don't want to misrepresent anything and make patients think that they'll be speaking to the PT if they'll be on the phone with an admin, but I do want to keep the calls. I like to use them as a screening call to make sure they're appropriate for my practice and use them to review logistics ahead of time. Thanks for your thoughts!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How are you currently wording it on your site? Could you possibly switch to a booking link that blocks out when you’re treating but allows for scheduled calls when you’re free?

If you’re wording it as “schedule free consult” or something similar I think you’d want it to be a therapist for at least the first part and then possibly transfer over to admin for the logistics piece.

> **Response 2:** Just a thought, that discovery phone call is a two way street. Clients are likely using it to determine if your personality, approaches, and expertise are a good match for them before they invest further. Personally, if I were going to seek out concierge style care (assuming you’re cash pay), I would want that person to spend a little time on the phone with me.  Just something to consider!

I recently hired 3 PTAs, which was very exciting. Two have been great. 1 is showing concerning behavior. She is lying her head down and napping in the clinic when she does not have patients while other therapists are treating. She will sit for 2-3 hours and not pitch in to clean the clinic if she does not have patients scheduled. We have a policy of no overtime unless approved yet she is the only therapists that goes into overtime. I was just told by another therapist that she fell alsleep while treating a patient. And the one day I left before her this week she stayed clocked in to get paid additional time when her patient left the clinic 25 minutes prior and the front desk said she "disappeared" for that time and waited to clock out late. How do you handle this? We just had a meeting last week on what therapists should do during down time, making sure therapist are clocking out on time, etc?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Document incidents, talk to the PT and set up clear objections to correct the behavior (if you want her to stick around 🤔) and check that she’s doing it. If she is in the probationary period and you don’t want her to stick around, fire her.

If you have employees, how many hours per week are you treating? I have 1 full time, 2 part times and 1 PRN who covers for vacation

Anyone else feeling guilty that they’re not treating as much? Im treating about 8 hours per week. I feel like I spend a lot of time doing admin/marketing/big picture vision things. I’m not always busy but my days are somehow full regardless. My goal has always been to gradually moving to working on the business, but still feel pretty guilty for not treating at least part time.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do not feel guilty!  You have to step out if you are going to do what's best for your employees and patients.  To build better things for them it is you duty to treat less.  If you do not you're doing you patients and team a disservice 💯

> **Response 2:** Do you feel guilty or do you miss it? If you like the admin and are profitable, do what you want. Your job is to run the business and pay your employees. If you miss it, can you delegate some of the predictable tasks to someone else so you can treat more?

Looking for some sound tax advice regarding a nanny. I run a mobile pelvic floor physical therapy practice. I have a nanny 15 hours a week. She helps clean and organize my PT equipment, and does laundry used in my PT visits. My son is still at 2 naps a day so she has no issue doing this while he’s napping. My question is-can I W2 her as a household employee AND 1099 her as a contractor for mt business? Technically,  she DOES both. I’ve had 2 different accountants tell me I CAN do both, and some paychecks would be W2/withholding, and some would be the contracted one (not withholding). Has anyone done this before? I’m still learning the ins and outs of business and finances, and do not want to overcomplicate anything if there are no benefits to both parties.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would keep them under W2 since you dictate what they do.

> **Response 2:** I wouldn’t over complicate it. Pick one. Go with it. 

Personally, I would make her an employee of the business and expense it all out.

I really don't want to go back to being a full time clinician but I'd really love to be getting a regular paycheck, PTO, regular business hours. The stress of being a business owner is getting to me. Going back to school is out if the question.  I'm not really sure what to do with myself.

Did some searching but couldn't find what I was looking for. Buckle up, this is a lot of lists. 😅

I want to start getting more serious about my wellness offerings, and I'm looking for a good system without nickel-and-diming myself into a corner later on. Ideally, this system would be able to meet me where I'm at in terms of offerings and price, and be able to grow with me down the line.

HIPPA compliance is fine but not required - it will not be for physical therapy services.

Ideally, this system would allow the option for clients to:
- self-schedule for 1-on-1 offerings
- self-schedule for classes
- purchase packages
- apply their package purchases to any eligible service
- cancel or reschedule their appointments
- add themselves as clients and store their payment information for easier checkouts

And it would give **ME** the option for:
- automated cancellation fee applied for cancellations within a certain time window
- automated email/text confirmations and reminders sent to clients
- automated notifications sent to ME when someone books
- auto-sync with Google calendar
- create unlimited service options
- payments through Square 
- booking calendar and "book now" buttons that I can embed in my website

***Things that would be nice to have as future optional add-ons***
- Ability to host a library of video courses
- Membership access to special digital collections
- Ability to have multiple provider calendars

- Ability for clients to choose their provider for eligible services

**Community Responses:**

Hoping that someone else has encountered this situation... I’m a PT and am considering renting an office space at a wellness center. They have LMTs, chiropractors, naturopaths, and acupuncturists. It’s a co-op so everyone working there is technically independent. 

There are front desk staff who answer calls and schedule massages for the LMTs. Less often, they schedule clients for the DCs, NDs, and acupuncturists.  

My issue is that they use the Mind Body program for scheduling. From what I understand, all clinicians and front desk staff can see everyone else’s schedule and client demographic info.

What questions should I be asking about patient privacy? About the front desk staff? Is there a work around with this program? 

Thanks in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You have an interesting question. You are speaking of a Wellness center instead of a Medical clinic. But there is likely confidential information that could be exposed, which us Therapists see as a HIPPA breach. Really how far do the HIPPA regulations extend? I would think that anything beyond their phone number and address is HIPPA bound. Are you seeing specific Medical information? 

The person who owns the Center and chose such a program is possibly not of the Allied Health/Medical profession.

> **Response 2:** I’m in a similar situation where I do PT out of a Pilates studio (where I also teach Pilates). We use Mind Body.  My schedule in Mind Body has my availability and my Pilates clients and when a PT patient is scheduled it simply says “PT”.  Then I use a separate EMR that no one has access to but me and the studio manager (who is HIPPA) trained.  In that schedule I have the name of the patient on the schedule.  It’s a pain to maintain two schedules and make sure they are both updated correctly but I haven’t found a better solution.

If you hire a physical therapist and guarantee them 32 hours a week(per their requested hours they want to work), how long do you expect it takes to get their caseload to build to a full caseload? What if their cancellation rate is awful(averages 40%) 90 days in? What would you do?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** are appointments being confirmed? are late fees and late cancels/no shows being collected? is there a reason why their patients are not being retained?

> **Response 2:** Who is taking the cancellation calls from patients?  Is it the therapist or an office manager?  

I would look at how those conversations are conducted.  For example, If a patient is calling to say they are running late, have to bring their kid with them, on their period (thinking pelvic health)  are they encouraged to still come on in or are they just immediately cancelled?  Make sure the person taking those calls is trying to recapture the visit that day or that week whenever possible.

In the past, documenting for wellness has been discussed in this group, and it seems to be split down the middle as far as what you should document (nothing vs a simple soap note to CYA). If PT is not being performed, but stretching and general strengthening exercises are (kindof like personal training), is it a bad idea to document very basically what was done (even just body part and basic exercise notes) to jog my memory for the next time? Or should it really just be documented arrival and payment and that’s it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I document a basic SOAP note for wellness. Most of the time no objective though and the assessment is "No adverse reaction noted". If I didn't have a section for "Services Rendered" then I would put it in the objective.

> **Response 2:** I used an excel type sheet to just list exercises and reps, much like a trainer would.

I would love to hear advice from anyone who has hired an independent contractor (1099) PT. Especially if for a mobile practice. 

I plan to get in touch with a small business lawyer to help with a contract, but I’m trying to brainstorm what things I need to think about that will come along with having this type of employee. 

Of course pay rate will be on the contract, but do you have any expectations for the contractor’s availability? I want them to have flexibility with their schedule but don’t want them to completely blow it off. Especially if I pour my own time and resources into helping them develop professionally. 

If you have a lawyer to recommend, I would also be interested (I’m located in Colorado).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have been 1099 for the past 4 years- as the person hiring 1099, you can not provide anything perceived as a benefit. The company I contract with does organize CEU courses under another consulting company umbrella for us, but we must pay a reasonable amount for it. Ie 16 hours cost us 175 dollars this year. 1099 laws vary in different states but they largely all say that you cannot dictate a minimum number of hours nor directly supervise how they provide the work. If you want control I suggest a PRN employee.

> **Response 2:** Discuss cancellation, no shows and rescheduled appts

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1. Turn the clock back and start looking a month ago
2.  Ask around. What PT’s, PTA’s do you know who you can make them an offer. Can you cherry-pick the best?  You may find that someone is ready to make a change, but they are remaining quiet.  I was “cherry-picked” for my last 3 corporate jobs
3. Look for someone who is bought into your mission and how you operate.  Don’t go for the first warm body. 
4. Be selective.  Seek a rock star personality.  Skills can be learned.  Attitude is important

> **Response 2:** Any PT or PTA schools nearby you can inquire with? Our local schools usually send out emails to their alums and potential grads

We are a new mobile PT company and growing pretty fast. We currently use WebPT, but not super thrilled with it. We are looking for an EMR system that is quicker with documentation, as well as giving us the option to have the patient sign in on a phone/ipad when the therapist gets to them. We would also like the option to take pictures of insurance cards etc directly into the patients profile instead of having to upload them manually. We also want something that has very straightforward billing integration that we can bring it in house in the near future, and won’t take up too much time for us to complete.

Anyone got any recommendations?

Thank you kindly!

Looking for the easiest way to accept payment and the processing fees. What is your favorite platform and why?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Jane app for my EMR and it has integrated payment system that is super easy. It creates super bills, and emails, the receipts directly to the patient.￼

> **Response 2:** I use square, venmo business.  They are both easy but i don’t like the processing fees

Posting this anonymously due to personal reasons on a simple question.

For those covering a clinic due to an urgent unforseen emergency, and are documenting on paper, do you truly document on paper or a word document?

As a background, I am helping a friend/colleague out who is out due to an unfortunate event. I've worked in the clinic before so it's not a new atmosphere but it's been a while.  Since I'm not in their EMR system and just "covering" to help keep patients going, we thought doing paper notes would be okay. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What have you done, you know too CYA 😂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would think you would document on something be it paper or a word document and put it in their EMR as a "late entry" and have them keep the originals with the original license/signature for their records to CYA and theirs.

> **Response 2:** Or ask the owner to contact the EMR company to give you temporary access - I'm sure this comes up for others as well. You'll need to be able to review charts of patients your are picking up as well.

Evaluating Prompt and Pteverywhere - does anyone have recent experience with these and can speak to pros/cons of each?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We just had a demo with prompt and the system looks absolutely amazing. ￼ If you currently use prompt, what type of practice do you have that you’re able to justify the significant price? We are a mobile pediatric therapy practice with a large percentage of Medicaid clients. ￼This comment is nothing against prompt at all, like I said, I think their platform is incredible and I would love to be able to afford it…..but the quote was 4.5x what I am paying for ClinicSource. 

Just trying to figure out how clinic owners make this work……

I'm looking for an exercise program app. I'm really like coach Now bc of the analysis feature. Everfit was one that I was checking out too. But now I'm also thinking an emr system combined with an exercise program would be the best right now. Are there good ones for insurance/cash businesses? 

Specifically looking for client/therapist interaction via the app (like coach now and everfit has). And something that I can easily add custom exercises too bc I have this horrible habit of making up variations of exercises that I can never find pictures/instructions to match up

Hi everyone! What insurance company do you use for workman’s compensation and why? We have HPSO and it’s very expensive.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For your employees?? ￼ currently I have only myself the owner as an employee, so I don’t have any, but I have State Farm waiting in the wings with a quote in case any of my contractors turn into employees. Seemed pretty reasonable to me.

> **Response 2:** We use Wave for payroll, and use Next for work comp. The charge is dependent on how many hours your employees work and as the owner I’m not covered.

Newb question….I’m a pilates studio owner with hopes to one day earn a DPT. I have an extra room in my studio and I’d like to add PT for our clients until I finish my DPT. ￼Is the best way to facilitate that through sub leasing the space to a current Uncaged PT? Would hiring them directly be a huge hassle? I’m sure this is a loaded question and I would really rather support a PT and our clients if I can but, I realize that it may not be a possibility. Thank you everyone! Keep crushing it out there! Be brave and GO!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am a PT and Pilates instructor also. I just opened a clinic that combines the two but previously I worked part time at various Pilates studios. At two of them I was an independent contractor working for the Pilates studio then later on I started my business and subleased space in a studio. Both worked well! Just very different depending on if you want to run the business side or have the PT be independent.

> **Response 2:** So Anthony Maritato was a trainer I think before he became a PT and hired a PT to work for him. He might be able to answer this.

Hello all,  I have recently launched my concierge physical therapy practice and secured Medicare credentials. My first Medicare patient inquiry was received today with the patient awaiting a physician's order. To date, I have seen a few self-pay patients, documenting their care using traditional paper-based methods. Is it necessary for me to adopt an EMR software solution to facilitate efficient documentation and billing for Medicare patients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Google docs and sheets. It works fine for me and solo practice. I put 10 daily note blanks in a folder

> **Response 2:** Hi, anonymous. Congrats on launching!!! 
NO, you do not NEEEEED an EMR to facilitate MC efficiency

I need a talk on being brave and quiting my job!

I already did last year, went down to PRN. It was all good until holidays. I was not enforcing healthy boundaries, patients were no showing, some insurances were not paying, and caseload went slightly low. I was feeling burnt out, did a few PRN sessions that were super easy and decided to go back 3 days a week. 

Now my private clinic is on fire. I am turning people away… I need to resign AGAIN. I am overworking to meet HH patients on top of my regular clinic… no lunch, dinner at 8 😞 I can’t keep this rhythm.

But I   I feel guilty because when I “needed” them they took me back, and now another PT (this one full time) just resigned.

I am not getting brave enough for another in person sit down with the director. Maybe an email, but I just am embarrassed of sitting down with her again and say… so you know how 9mo ago you took me back… well… can we go back to PRN? 😬😬😬😬

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The way I see it, if they are a great company that “took you back” and genuinely look out for their employees, then they’ll be happy for you that your business is booming and should be willing to work with you. If they “took you back” because it was in their best interests and can’t be happy for you that you’re doing well, then why should you stress about it? Do what you need to do and take care of yourself.

> **Response 2:** They didn't take you back cuz they where nice, they needed you. Prolly in an area where there is a shortage of rehab. You call the shots for now

**Original Post:**
Hello everyone! Happy new year.

I wanted to get advice on how to manage being busy. I have gotten very very busy, to the point where I have patients on a waitlist. I hate this because I hate patients not being able to get in. Subconsciously I just feel bad and that people will talk bad about how they can’t get in.

But what I really need advice for is:

1. how I can have my secretary/front office person manage better with so much going on and with scheduling. And how to properly explain to patients that we will get them in as soon as we can. Are there any iMac applications or softwares we can buy where we can create a daily checklist to follow so we don’t miss anything?

2. As far as when talking to the patients, because we have some patients who can’t get the times that they want or have to come very early or very late, any advice on how to manage this?

3. We get a lot of referrals via primary cares and word of mouth, how do we handle it now that we are so busy? I cannot fathom the idea of telling physicians to stop sending patients as I don’t want to hurt the relationships we have with them.

4. I know the big obvious answer is to hire someone, and I’ve been looking (definitely not hard enough) but any advice on this too? I don’t live in a super popular big city so it’s definitely not going to be a first choice for a lot of people. But I looked hard last summer to hire someone and had no luck at all.

Thanks everyone and look forward to hearing your advice. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hire and work on the systems up front and with the hire.  So they keep the level that you patients have come to expect.  Checklist, for what. What is the goal of making sure nothing is missed.  What might your frond office miss.  Automate that process where you can

> **Response 2:** Always easy to say hire, not as easily done, but get the process started. What a phenomenal  problem to have!! Congratulations!! Be proud! One way to handle this is to consider your perfect/ideal patient  and start prioritizing  that way. As therapist we always want to help everyone, however, that's not possible. This is a great time for you to streamline and determine what you really want your business to become. You have options now without a doubt. If there is a population that lights your fire as a practitioner go that direction or, even if it is challenging for therapist to change their perspective this way, go towards an area of practice which increases your profitability. Is that insurance, or a population who would prefer to pay per service instead of insurance, or pay for additional alternative/ non-insurance reimbursed treatments? You are in high demand and you shouldn't feel bad about that, not for one second! Make sure your front desk handles it with Grace and with empathy but also not with shame. If you give the perspective that you are doing something wrong by not getting everyone in the door right away, the takeaway will be a negative. Flip it so that the wait list is a positive and one that creates further desire for the patient to want to wait

Asking for myself and my company. 

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First of all, I am grateful daily for every single person that works WITH me (I don't say FOR me). I once heard, "it is a virtual miracle that your employees show up to work. They don't have to". So I make sure to say "thanks" a LOT.
#2 I ASK them if they can take patients. I don't do their scheduling. I treat them like the intelligent, competent, adults they are. No one likes to be micromanaged.
#3 I don't believe in productivity. In this field, it is absolutely unwarranted and ruining healthcare. 
#4 I ask how I can be of service to them. It is my belief that as admin, my job is supporting the staff in the field. (I own a home health staffing company). It's not easy to drive from patient to patient, call doctors, communicate with the care team. If I can make their day easier by doing a menial task, I do it!
(I should add that everyone who works with me is an independent contractor and has complete choice over their schedule. As a 1099, I'm able to offer them more freedom)

> **Response 2:** Ooooh this is such a great question 👏🏼 
I’m a solopreneur, but I’m excited to hear everyone’s answers! 

I take hikes, work outside, say no to businesses that don’t align, and strive to eventually be “a job maker, not a job taker”

I currently use WebPT and I love how for a new patient you can click on the body region for the initial examination and it loads all the tests and measures for that specific type of patient. Which EMR systems out there already has set up templates for initial evaluations depending on diagnosis and body region that you can click on an load and then perform your examination by choosing which tests and measures you want to use? It’s my understanding Jane App does not provide this.  Are there others that do similar to WebPT ?  Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use stride EMR.  Moved over from WebPT.  I built out my templates by body part.  I love how stride also let me build out goals.  It's a bit of work on the front end but once it's all built out it's click and go.  Evals are about 20 min of paperwork time start to finish.  I love how the digital I take that the patient fills out imports directly to your evaluation so really it's just reviewing what the patient put in, filling in my objective findings then using AI to generate assessment and justification for therapy and scrubbing goals for specific patient.

> **Response 2:** Echo the above

I like the system overall, but the notes aren’t aesthetically pleasing to my eye especially when trying to carry objective measures and goals forward. Looking to switch documentation systems but everyone seems to really like Jane. What am I missing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have you gone through any of the templates on their template library?

Hi! Does any in this group have a recommendation for a hi-lo table they have purchased and love? I switched from mobile PT to fully in-clinic a little over a year ago, and am still using my fold-able treatment table, but would like to get something more sturdy long-term. I'm on the fence about springing for the hi-lo table if I am purchasing a new one. For context, I don't spend huge amounts of time doing manual therapy, so it hasn't been a huge issue for my own comfort/body mechanics, but there are occasions where more adjustability would be nice.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hello, Katie. I also find a bar activated table from Armedica and Chattanooga user-friendly.

> **Response 2:** I have an armedica table with footbar switch accessible from anywhere around the table which I like

Can someone post what your evaluation/daily notes look like if you’re using Google docs?  I’m tired of paying my EMR company every month for their services, especially since they are not a good fit for my mobile PT business. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Check out Unsubscribed Healthcare. It’s a PT who has created an EMR using Google Docs through Google Workspace (you can pay for HIPPA compliance through Workspace). Max Shippen sells his templates for EMR and billing

> **Response 2:** also know you have to have encryption for hipaa compliance for your notes so saving w/in a normal google doc in the cloud may not meet that requirement

Mobile therapists, do you send the patients paperwork to complete prior to first visit, or do you bring your IPAD to their home and they fill it out there ?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I send my paperwork to the patient if possible before the first visit so I have info before I see them

> **Response 2:** My EMR JaneApp sends it automatically when I schedule an eval. Most people fill it out with the exception of some of my 90 year olds. At that point I go over with them on the first visit.

When did you know you were able to switch from offering a 1099 position to an hourly W-2 or salaried position? I’m scheduling an appt with my accountant but wanted to hear from people in practices. I have a 1099 clinician that is at about 20 direct contact hours. SLP practice. Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Agreeing with what everyone said about misclassification.  1099 = you do not dictate their schedule, you do not provide them with any tools or equipment, you do not mandate a dress code, etc.  In other words, they provide you a service.  Think of it as hiring the repairman.  You hire him to do "x" job but he comes when he can, brings his own tools and wears what he wants.  Anything else is a W2.  W2= if you dictate their work hours or schedule, you provide them with equipment and you tell them to wear scrubs.  *hope that helps

> **Response 2:** From talking to a lawyer here in CO many people are misclassified as “1099” that really are W2 employees. Have you looked at the requirements for classification for both categories? Or consulted with an attorney?

What are typical PRN rates in a hospital and a nursing home setting as a PT? Asking so that I can offer better when hiring.  I’m in South Carolina if that matters

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 45-55$ depending on which option you chose. I am 43ish, but only 100 hour minimum for the year. For more money, you could offer weekends and holidays. Hospital setting

> **Response 2:** montana is anywhere from 30-45 consistently. Not a joke either. They don’t seem to compensate differently for prn it’s very odd. I get paid more in OP than I would if I was PRN at the hospital

Hey everyone! Any feedback on Embodia vs Jane App for a solopreneur? I’m looking for something that is very user friendly. I am not tech savvy at all. I watched the demos for both. Leaning towards Jane App right now.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cant speak to embodia but ive been on Jane for 3 weeks.  It just checked the boxes for me: scheduler, reminders to patients, charting, payments.  I think theres room for improvement from Jane but I’m running my practice from my phone which is nice.

> **Response 2:** Embodia! I switched from Jane to Embodia. It has a built in HEP system that I love, is cheaper, has secure email/fax, and really does all the same things as Jane

What do you all have for brick and mortar building security system and entrance door? I am by myself and I don’t have any front desk staff, I am by appointment only and sometimes the next person comes few minutes early and they use the waiting area, however I am in the treatment room hands on so can’t always go out to unlocks the doors. However I also don’t want someone strange walking in to the building? It is an ok neighborhood but there are crimes everywhere? What do you all do? 
Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a similar set up.  I have a security camera in the waiting room that records when there’s movement and I can review recorded videos and live streaming on an app on my phone. 

I have chimes that sounds when the front door opens. 

I can lock the door between the waiting room and the rest of my office.

A few years ago I had some problems with some really creepy guy patients so I have a few other safety measures too:

Apple Watch because of the press and hold security feature  

Waistband toggle that makes an ear piercing sound if removed from the waistband

And hornet spray (one of my patients that’s a police officer recommended this). It shoots a stream 20-30 feet and doesn’t create a cloud that could also affect you.  He said to aim for the eyes.  I have one in my rollie computer desk and a few others in various places around the office.

> **Response 2:** I wonder if you could use something like Level, depending on the type of door? You could have a standard key lock for full opening and closing and then use a temporary pass for your patients if they show up a few minutes early and want to use the secondary Level lock.

Those that transitioned from mobile to clinic: what are some unexpected fixed expenses that you had besides from rent/utilities/tax/renter insurance 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What Jaimie Gant said.  

Also, I definitely prefer to have admin in the office so they can scan, print, check in, schedule, remind of appts, sometimes open the door for people (our door can be heavy for some), mine also cleans between sessions, keeps a running list of supplies needed, and keeps the whole place clean

water cooler station (mine is inserted in the bottom which is nice but it can provide hot, cool, cold;

equipment that may not want to be or able to be with you for mobile equipment including racks for them, mirrors on wall, railings

signage (windows, outside if you get a space, parking if needed, decals for walls

furniture: decor, tables, chairs (waiting room, treatment spaces), treatment table(s)

LOVED moving from mobile to B&M.  I can see more people, not as much wear and tear on my car, and have more ability to help people further with the equipment needs, not take time with set up/take down with mobile, etc

(hopefully that helps!)

> **Response 2:** Depending on what’s included in your lease/how the space is set up: internet, things for the bathroom (TP, hand soap, paper towels), cleaning supplies, office supplies (again, depending on what you need - printer, paper, pens/pencils, etc)

Hi! My practice is new. I want to get enrolled with Medicare right away! How long did the process take for you guys? Who could you recommend to help me with the process?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We recommend therapists do it themselves so you can go in and update as needed. Process is not that difficult. ;)

> **Response 2:** They are a little slower now but still report it will be approved in 1-2 months. I submitted my app on line with a call in to Medicare line to help on the 4th and got an email this week to add two new documents for them so it took about 3 weeks for them to look at my app

Hi Everyone,

I'm in need of a pep talk or any advice. 
We've just surpassed 1 year of business and have been on track with our goals. 
However, recently, we've had SO MANY cancellations. It's starting to wear me down. Both myself and my other therapist on staff are dealing with this and it's making me feel like I'm doing something wrong or people don't think we are worth It. Since August we've had at least a few a week (minimum) or shuffling around the schedule. I know I shouldn't focus on that because we've also had so many great wins but sometimes it's hard and I want to minimize this going forward. As a side we are all cash pay. 
Thanks for your help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First off, that can be completely normal this time of the year. You are doing great! If you are on track with your goals, then just focus on the wins and less on the losses. 

If the cancellations become a consistent problem, then go back and focus on communication and how the plan of care is communicated during the evaluation and during each treatment to the clients. That can usually clear up cancellation problems.

> **Response 2:** So the question is what are you doing about it?
...
Once you acknowledge the problem the next step is developing a system to resolve it and prevent it. 
...
There are lots of ways to fix this problem. 
...
Some therapists will impose strict cancel fees, others will secure payment in advance. 
...
Personally I find that this is a signal that my marketing is targeting the wrong patients. When I stopped treating low back pain referrals and focused on post op TKR referrals my cancel/no show rate dropped to near zero. 
...
It is normal to feel frustrated, but that is when you put on your business owner hat and realize you can control the situation and make a change.

Who has used webPT for outpatient or mobile practice PT  visits?  What did you like about it for PT evals and tx notes? What didnt you like about it?  How much time did u spend charting to complete the eval doc AFTER done with patient ???

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We don’t use it, but I was just at a conference with a group of therapy professionals and they were telling me that they would like to switch because the prices keep getting higher and they were not satisfied with it. However, I have not personally used it and it’s been over five years since I did check them out personally￼

> **Response 2:** I have used 8 different EMR systems in 6.5 years. I rank WebPT as 7 out of the 8. I still have to use WebPT for my “caged” job and despise it. Only one worse than that I have used is Meditech.

Hey everyone. I am getting ready to open a mobile practice later this year. I'm wondering if anyone is aware of any free bookkeeping software? Im not planning on starting until June -August of this year, but would like to get accustomed to the software before hand. I would rather not be paying a monthly fee when I'm not making money yet.  
I've signed up for Google workspace so I am paying for that. Is there a bookkeeping app available in Google workspace?
Thanks!

Question: how does one hire someone?  Legal stuff, contracts, payroll, benefits, etc.  Explain this to me like I’m a 5 year old.  😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That depends greatly if you want a 1099 or W2 :)

> **Response 2:** 1. Hire employment attorney 
2. Determine contract type

1099 no extra bells and whistles but the attorney is necessary to make sure you are compliant with the law. Most contractors should actually be W2 employees….you can, and likely will, get audits from the IRS with 1099 contractors.

The following is for W2
3. Benefits are through a benefits broker. You can find them online or at networking events
4. Contact CPA and bookkeeper to determine best payroll system. 
5. Create onboarding strategy, policies and procedures, handbook.
6. File for state unemployment insurance and update LLC 
7. Purchase business liability and umbrella policy.
8. Get quotes for adding therapist to malpractice.
9. Get someone to agree to salary 
10. Sign contract
11. Add them to policies
12. Add them to any insurance contracts
13. W4 and I9 process
14. Get ready to pay taxes

Hey all. Up until now, I have used Google Workspace / google voice with a BAA for all my charting and communication with clients. I am a cash-based provider who is now doing roughly 30-40 visits a month, so the manual reminders for appts are adding up, and I am considering switching to a different platform for EMR. I am looking for a way to streamline appt reminders, documentation, and automate sending of superbills.

 Is there a particular EMR system that anyone with a similar type of practice that would be easiest to transfer my stuff from Google Workspace to? Is this even a possibility? I am also open to keeping Google workspace and making it more user-friendly for myself. Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Perfect.  Thank you all!

I recently rented a space in a holistic cash based practice. I am the only PT amongst NPS, chiros, massage therapist , sound therapist, yoga etc. I have been asked to participate in their marketing event and do short paid sessions of cupping or MFR

Can I do hands on sessions without a proper eval, should I have the clients fill out consent forms?

If not what other services/ consults can I offer?

I don't want to miss the opportunity to introduce myself to prospective clients. I am in NC..

Any ideas?

TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How is it set up? Open house type deal, or are participants flowing from one section to another on a schedule of sorts? Free flowing open house events, I do better with postural screenings and being able to interact in small groups because splitting off one person to set up cupping can get awkward. If it is a round robin- groups come and spend 15 minutes with each provider, or individuals sign up for 10 minute “taster” sessions, then I would prepare short presentations for groups or do the hands on (consent forms always!) if they are coming over individually. Truly, being able to ask questions and respond to the person/group in front of you is pretty impactful without a hands on demo- I usually gain clients from doing this in a social atmosphere. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** I’m no lawyer, but I’d def get a signed consent form and have them fill out a health questionnaire to CYA and screen them w a quick eval - whatever that looks like for you. Document as well, even if you have some forms on hand printed out for them and a quick way for you to document what you assessed and what you did. 

Make sure your liability insurance covers you out of the office if this is offsite. 

Im assuming NC is a direct access state?

I’m afraid to switch EMRs as it sounds complex and some complicated and require that the provider set up all the templates for evals for every body region and daily notes etc.  Too much to do to get started.  I prefer an EMR with templates included  so I’m on the fence to switch. Please comment on your EMR experience as to what you use and if it has already built in compliant templates for exams and daily notes etc.  Thanks

**Community Responses:**

For those of you that do not work with insurances and provide cash based services such as dry needling, taping, manipulation techniques, and other holistic health and wellness/pain management services, what do you typically label your invoices for and what type of documentation are you using for both liability protection and reference points (whether that’s for your patients personal information or for a repeat customer to track modalities and treatments utilized)? This is a bit of a run on question, so I apologize for that! Just wanting to make sure everything is covered before I start marketing this part of my business. Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Healthie. I document in a free text daily note for most visits. It has forms you can make templates of you want.

> **Response 2:** I use Google docs (for business with BAA in place) and write a SOAP note for each session documenting what I did. I also record what CPT codes cover what I did, what ICD-10 I'm treating for, length of visit, and fee charged.

What do you guys do when say you are treating a patient with low back and then they have shoulder pain few weeks later. Low back is manageable.

Get new referral for shoulder to treat and DC low back and start a new case with Eval for shoulder?
Get the patient to sign new consent forms?

Or continue within the same case by adding a re Eval?

This is for Medicare in CA just FYI.

Mobile Neuro Business. I am also wanting to add on OT and SLP later this year or next year. Medicare/Cash. Which EMR system would you recommend and why? Preferrably something with billing unless you think that with Medicare only its not too terrible to do it myself. 

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t want to vote in the poll as I don’t know about any of the systems except Jane, and I don’t use it for billing since I’m cash-based. But I’ll just throw in my opinion that Jane is easy to use for me (I’m just one person who is not particularly tech-savvy, and I got it all set up and ready to go by myself, with assistance from a responsive customer service and set-up guides). Ask me in two weeks when I actually start seeing patients with it lol. (I’ve made a demo patient and done just about everything I can think of that I would need to in a patient’s chart, including accepting payment, and it was so easy. On a side note, my sister houses HelloNote and likes it too. She also does Medicare billing with it.)

> **Response 2:** I've used WebPT with TheraBill, HelloNote and Prompt.  Prompt hands down has been the best.  It is super user friendly, keeps me very organized, easy to find things, alerts if the patient POC is under or over however many visits for any weeks, I like their documentation as it flows easier than HelloNote.  HelloNote was excellent for more of a minimalistic approach, but they are adding more features and I know a lot of therapists who use it!  Prompt also integrates with srfax, PTWired, and I just liked the features.  The features save me an immense amount of time to find admin or billing items and I can quickly address.  The support with HelloNote was great and very timely.  I also really love Prompt's support them.  Plus, they have a Chick-fil-a feel with their desire and happiness to help.  Their support is a team of clinicians and billers so they can answer a lot more questions since they understand what the question is.  I'm unsure of others that do that.  Hope that helps!

In the end, do what works best for your practice!  I wear a lot of hats in my business because I want to, so I wanted more robust, save time, efficiency, etc.

Oh...VERY important to add, make sure to do a demo with the ones you want to look at, and make sure they are confident in their answers about dealing with insurance or Medicare.  (Example: how does the EMR keep up with the threshold, POC ending, fax status or log if ever audited, etc)  I've heard wonderful things with Jane, and I'm not sure if they've added much on the insurance side yet that can help alert you with those.  Maybe someone else can have input!

**Original Post:**
Wondering if this is fair as an employee at an outpatient clinic? 

1. You are expected to “manage your caseload on your own time”, meaning you have to go over all of your patient’s insurance and scheduling eligibilities outside of work hours, which is audited. This can take up to 2 hours, you aren’t allowed to do this during work hours where you don’t have patients scheduled, but there aren’t any rules against doing this while treating pts, so that is what PTs might do to avoid taking work home. It’s stressful because every pt is given a survey periodically to rate each PT, and multitasking while treating pts risks lower ratings, and management only seems to care about negative feedback. Is it fair to have the PTs do this or should clinics typically hire enough administrative staff to address these duties? 

2. There is a “productivity %” that determines your work performance where any week there is a certain % of gaps in a PT’s schedule, management will put the blame on the PT. At times there are gaps because there is no patient available to come at that time, and for patients who don’t show up we often treat patients shared across different PTs so many times they aren’t even pts you usually see, or initial evaluations you’ve never spoken to, or pts who simply don’t prioritize PT or their health. Management seems to stress more how much you can fill your schedule and interacting with pts in ways that will keep them as customers, and less on getting existing patients as best as they can faster. Is this fair to frame the work performance on how filled the schedule is, which isn’t completely within the PT’s control?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you’re doing all this on your own time instead of admin you might as well go solo!

> **Response 2:** Also, sounds illegal to be told to work on your own time. If you’re working for the company, then they should be paying you for the tasks. Never work off the clock, ￼unless you own your own business.

Has anyone transitioned into a Clinical Liaison position? I am a PT interviewing for one tomorrow for an inpatient rehab hospital and  looking to learn more about people’s experience. It strikes me as a role where you could be asked to do way too much for what you’re paid and cause higher burn out or turn over, but not sure. 

This job offers a base salary of 80-95k based on salary plus commission but I’m not sure how the commissions would work??

Would love to hear from others if they like the role, what they make, and how commissions work? Any red flags to look for or questions to ask in the interview tomorrow? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is my experience , the Commission is  for the admission # you have over your monthly target #.  This role was a good learning experience for me but ultimately ended up being very poor work life balance. It depends on your company and the working structure and supports that are in place (eg : how are weekend/holiday referrals and admissions handled, how late in the evening do they accept admissions, how are team members vacations covered) and how often are they changing your monthly/yearly targets

> **Response 2:** I work as a clinical liaison. It’s very fast paced and your therapy knowledge will be a very small part of the role. Need to have a strong understanding of medical management, case management, insurance etc. Every facility is different as far as expectations. 

I would make sure to ask what your target would be for admissions, what referral sources you will cover, if you are allowed to work from home vs hybrid (as this will greatly affect your work life balance)

I'm hiring my first contract employee. I'm a single member LLc but for tax purposes, and S corp.  What things do I need to consider in doing this? I have an employee contract, way to do payroll.  Do I need to add her to my liability insurance??  But I assume she carries her own too?  She will get a percentage of the visit plus the surcharge for the travel will be hers.  Is she responsible for her own equipment?  She will use my EMR... What else am I missing?  Thank you!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congratulations on hiring your first contractor! Here’s a rundown of essential considerations:

1. Independent Contractor Classification: Make sure she meets the requirements for a 1099 contractor, not a W-2 employee. This means she should have flexibility in how and when she works, supply some of her own equipment, and take on some business risks (like travel expenses).

2. Insurance: Yes, you’ll want her to carry her own liability insurance. It’s still a good idea to confirm this with your own insurer, as they might require you to list contractors for full coverage. Having clear documentation of her liability coverage can help protect both of you.

3. Contract Specifics: Make sure your contract covers:

Payment Terms: Outline the percentage per visit, any reimbursement for travel, and payment timelines.

Confidentiality and HIPAA Compliance: Since she’s using your EMR, include specific language about HIPAA compliance and patient data security.

Non-compete or Non-solicitation Clauses: Decide if you want any limitations around her working with your clients independently.

4. EMR Access and Compliance: Ensure she’s trained on your EMR and understands your documentation standards. Since she’s using your system, emphasize that she adheres to the same security measures you do.

5. Equipment: If she’s responsible for her own equipment, be clear about what is needed to fulfill the job (e.g., laptop, mobile device, therapy tools) and ensure this is in writing. Anything you provide would technically be taxable, so it’s easier for her to provide her own if she can.

6. Payroll and Taxes: If she's a 1099 contractor, you won’t withhold taxes for her, but make sure to issue her a 1099-NEC at the end of the year for tax purposes. Keep detailed payment records to help her accurately report her income.

7. Worker’s Compensation: While 1099 contractors typically aren’t covered by worker’s comp, it’s worth checking your state’s requirements, as some have specific regulations for certain industries.

8. Clear Communication: Especially with your first hire, be proactive in setting up regular check-ins to make sure everything is running smoothly. A strong onboarding process will help set clear expectations and keep the working relationship positive.

Starting with these steps will help lay a solid foundation for both of you!

> **Response 2:** I hired two people this year, one W2 and one independent. Their rolls for employment are very different. For W2, I have a number of associated costs (disability, liability, payroll taxes, mileage stipend, health insurance, etc). My independent contractor has none of those associated costs/benefits. She is paid a flat fee for service/per session rate vs my w2 who is hourly. Independent carries her own insurance and pays her own taxes on what she receives. States and fed is VERY specific about differentiating between the two. Carefully do your research and decide what role you want your new hire to have. And be specific.  The contract you have this person sign should state what type of hire they are.

Good morning, my fiancé and I are travel physical therapists and are considering starting to run a mobile practice while we are on the go. The one thing that has us stumped right now is health insurance as we would no longer be getting benefits through our travel companies. Any recommendations or resources on the best and most affordable marketplace insurance plans? Thank you in advance and I hope you all have a wonderful day striving towards financial freedom!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Marketplace is based on your state of residence because states can do whatever they want with those plans they can sell them at cost or they can jack the price up and pocket the change. Every state has different laws regarding short term plans some don’t offer them at all and some states like Iowa allows. You to have them up to three years and they are pretty good deals. You can always consider a health Cost sharing plan and supplement it with a policy like Aflac hospitalization,accident and injury. All state dependent. I am an agent and a PT.

> **Response 2:** I always wonder if they are cataustrophic only and if they cover what we do when we are the patient.  

My first OT director made changes happen for the entire hospital employees’ insurance because there was no OT coverage  (circa 1993) yet they staffed OT!?!?

Can you imagine being a PT/OT/ST and not having coverage that we fight for every day?

I have a Med B mobile practice and employ 2 other W2 PTs. I am looking to add another PT and have an interested candidate. However, they have started a mobile practice of their own. Her schedule has started slow, so she is looking at the possibility of contracting with me. Has anyone else had this situation, and if so, how do you set boundaries with patients that you provide them to ensure they stay within your practice even when they want to return after being discharged? Or is this just not a good option?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wouldn't want to invest the time, money, and energy into training someone to work for me who is essentially planning to leave (and then become a competitor) once they had the opportunity. Then you'll just have to spend more time, money, energy into finding and training her replacement.

> **Response 2:** I would be honest with the employee and ask them to not solicit patients and basically make it a condition of their employment. Yes, you are working on the “honor system”, but it’s the best you are going to get.

Hi friends! I'm looking for advice on whether I should be hiring contractors or employees for a mobile pediatric PT practice in California. Moreso, am I allowed to hire contractors? 

In CA, there is this ABC test that helps classify workers and it doesn't seem like any PT for a PT practice could be a contractor then? https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_independentcontractor.htm

"Under the ABC test, a worker is considered an employee and not an independent contractor, unless the hiring entity satisfies all three of the following conditions:
1. The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact;
2.The worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business; and
3. The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed."

Help please :(

Thank you in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think the C part puts a dent in that plan. I have several friends who had to deal with pretty expensive lawsuits for this. If you can make the numbers work, just make them employees and move on. ￼

> **Response 2:** what I will say is if there is ever any disagreement about classifying, the state will ALWAYS side with making them w2 vs 1099.

Question in regards to documenting levels of assistance with Medicare . Examples as follows: 1) if a therapist needs to bring w/c behind someone for rest breaks (patient is steady)  when walking with FWW what level of assistance is this labeled as (Min A, CGA/SBA) 2) If a therapist needs to navigate the O2 tank while someone is walking steadily with a FWW, what level of assistance is documented? 3) If a therapist has to navigate a catheter during an activity (stairs, walking, picking up objects) and patient is steady , what level of assistance is given ? There is a debate at my clinic on what should be documented with therapist helping with ‘external’ things vs what the patient is actually needing help during the activity. Hopefully this makes sense. Thanks everyone  for your feedback.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can also document SBA walking with maxA for managing O2/catheter etc. 
The wheelchair example, I agree with the above example of how far they can go independently. What happens if you don't have the chair? Can they independently find somewhere to rest? Do they fall? Or is it out of convenience/meeting rehab goals so you can push to their limits and have the chair ready?

> **Response 2:** It would depend on necessity and my goal for the treatment. 

In the second case I would document that as CGA/SBA and note I assisted with O2 tank. Realistically this patient needs to have a discussion with their pulmonologist to get a portable concentrator since it’s nearly impossible for a person to to use a FWW and O2 tank safely unless it’s hooked or adhered to the FWW. 

In a similar case, if I had to carry a FWW up stairs for my patient during stair training with CGA otherwise, then I would document as Min A and note it was for equipment due to a specific deficit limiting them from performing independently.

**Original Post:**
Hi. I met some women who are writing an e-book for post-partum Moms.  More regarding depression, lactation, tongue tied infants, etc and their personal experience.  The goal would be for them to eventually monetize on this e-book.  They asked me to contribute to a chapter on pelvic health, in which it would be co written and reviewed by me, Pelvic Health Physical Therapist.  They would link my practice, my name and their IG posts to my practice.  They also plan to do webinars, with me, that would promote my clinic and some local in person sessions in the community.  

Now, how should I get compensated?  

They have expressed that they are limited in funds when I asked regarding payment and the marketing would be exposure/benefit.  Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.  Thank You

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm not sure chapter authors are paid very much...my cardiopulm PT professor told me once he was paid $300 to contribute a chapter to a text book...not sure if that is typical or not.

> **Response 2:** You usually don’t get paid to add a chapter in a book. You get to call yourself an author after this and promote it as YOUR book too. You get to give it away, sale it or whatever else you want to do with it. Many times with these kinds of books you are asked to pay to contribute. If they’re not asking for money and they have a decent following, I would do it!! It is going to open doors for you. “Hey, I’m Monica! Im a PT and local author who wrote this chapter on women’s health. I would love to leave a couple copies here for your clients to help educate them. Would that be ok?” 

Yep!!!! 

Sometimes you can even work out between all the authors to have a separate cover for each author to promote them. 

There are so many possibilities with this kind of collaboration. Just do it. You can write a chapter in a week. 

Here’s how. 

1) mind map your chapter 
What’s it going to be about?
What are the 5-10 things everyone needs to know about it?
What questions do people have?
What problems are you solving?
What is the solution? 

2) write or dictate it
3) edit it
4) send it to the other author

BOOM YOURE AN AUTHOR! 

And now you’re the AUTHORITY!

Favorite EMR system? Everyone has didferent needs  
I am looking mainly for 💯% cash practice. I like my paper documentation so I would like to use the EMR system for scheduling, reminder text messages, confirmations text messages, and a brief note on each patient from each visits that is going to be easy for me to pull it out from the schedule. A way to send a mass email would be great for newsletters as well  

which one is going to be the most affordable for just one practitioner

For anyone using Jane App or Simple Practice, how are you faxing/receiving POC's or other patient information? I have an outside fax line and use simple practice but trying to make it more streamlined with how I receive, store and integrate these documents. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Jane and SRFax. I have to download documents from Jane into SRFax to send out. When I receive one, it shows up in email. I then have to upload it into Jane. I have a separate spreadsheet where I track what's been sent and when it comes back. I admit it's a bit of a hassle. I wish Jane had a fax system integrated.

> **Response 2:** I use Srfax with SimplePractice. Make a chart note when I fax POC for signature and also have a spread sheet of 1st/2nd attempts, when receive signed POC, when cert expires, when D/C and color code. I upload pdf of signed POC (naming document with end date of certification of POC) to patient chart and if needed make “other appt” on the day cert POC is up as another reminder.

Hi everyone! 👋
As my practice continues to grow, I’m looking into upgrading to a more comprehensive software system—something that can handle scheduling, text reminders, documentation, and ideally serve as one central hub. A fellow clinician recommended Jane, and I’m curious if anyone here uses it.

If you do:

 • How do you like it?

 • What features do you use most?

 • Has it been worth the cost/ROI?

And if you use a different platform, I’d love to hear what you’re using and how it’s working for your practice as well.

Thanks so much—hope you’re all having a great week!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jane is dope! And their customer service is top notch. I made lots of calls and zooms setting things up and when questions came up as I was tinkering with it. They were and continue to answer each question with tons of patience and expertise.

> **Response 2:** At Uncaged Clinician, we recommend Jane!  You will also receive an initial discount for mentioning us.

What do you do when a client has outstanding balances and completely stop responding to invoice reminders?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Our companies policy is to take payment up front but in the rare case we have to send an invoice and they don’t pay after reminders, we don’t send them to collections but they will not be able to book any more services until they get current. It is more of a compassionate approach because I never know what everyone is going through but they won’t get any further services until they pay for their past services.

> **Response 2:** Take it as a lesson to get credit card for all clients and bill lrior to service from now on. Provide a terms of service as part of the intake process.

I started my cash-based mobile vestibular practice in April and thinking about offering a telehealth option. I don’t have an EMR, I use Google Workspace and just signed up with doxy.me. What do I need to do to set this up? Telehealth patient consent form? Anything else? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Telehealth and mobile vestibular PT here!  You have to document that you used audio and visual format using doxy.me for telehealth appointments, and you have to document the individual's address at the time of service (okay to say "refer to address in intake paperwork").  You also have to be licensed in the state where the patient is located at the time of the service.

> **Response 2:** 1) You can use Google Workspace as an EMR. Check out Unsubscribed Healthcare on YouTube. 

2) Our state practice act (KY) had information on what they needed us to have on file. Or maybe it was Medicare... Pretty sure it was our practice act though. It was pretty straightforward, just a couple forms and some things to verbally verify at the front of each telehealth session.

Do you give your intake forms to patients via email prior to their appointment?

I'd rather just have them fill It out in person rather than me sending it to them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, I email them before so I have time to review them before the eval and do any additional research I might want to do. It's less stressful for me to have the information written down and then I ask the patient clarifying questions as needed.

> **Response 2:** I don’t waste the time with paperwork. 
…
I get the required signatures, but that is all. 
…
The health related questionnaires seem like a waste of time. They usually answer wrong anyway and I am going to ask them all those questions during our first session.

Credentialing!
What is the best way to start a credentialing process? Is it worth it to do it on your own or just outsource it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Frankly in our therapy business builder programs we feel it is better to learn and understand the process. But if you don't there are several people who will do it for you (myself included). The key is you need to have some control overall of the process and understand what they are doing.

> **Response 2:** Do it yourself. 

It’s literally just filling out forms of information and waiting to hear back.

Hello! Wondering if I can get a little insight from those that are mobile cash PTs with W2 employees. 

I have been in practice for just over a year and a half in Wisconsin as a mobile PT and am going to hire in January. I'm hiring someone with 9 years of experience and am looking for recommendations for good packages?

Debating between hourly and salary? Certain dollar amount that is fair/competitive? Benefits? (Thinking SEP IRA with matching contributions at certain time points with retention and certain dollar amount for CEUs annually). She does not need health benefits. Thinking maybe bonuses for surpassing or meeting productivity standards or incentivizing referrals she generates with a great dollar value. Too many ideas and not sure where to start.

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don't hesitate to ask her what she is looking for.  Your ideas above are great ideas with regards to benefits.  Whichever pay structure you choose (hourly vs salary) - and there isn't necessarily a "right one or a "wrong one" because this could change as she grows; the more important thing is you identify the expectations you have of her.

> **Response 2:** #WI #Employees - Suggest contacting State of WI and understand requirements for employees...... I came across my written notes (from several phone calls) 13 years ago.... and reminisced about how much time (and errors) it saved when setting up WI LLC, and understanding obligations for WC, retirement requirements, employees, ( 1 employee v. 1+ and different req.) etc.

Hey everyone! 

When hiring a contract PTA (W2/1099 contractor), what have you been responsive for as the employer and what have you had the independent contractor be responsible regarding:

Lliability insurance
NPI (secondary needed if they work at another facility?)
Workers comp insurance? 
Reimbursing for Mileage (if mobile)

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was under the impression that a PTA could not be an independent contractor as they have to work under your license, so they must be a W2 employee...

> **Response 2:** A contractor must be either/or W2 or 1099. I do not provide anything for the 1099 other than a higher rate. A 1099 is able to write off the cost of liability insurance, equipment, and mileage. A W2 cannot.
I do have workers comp for them only because some of our contracted home health agencies require it for their certifications (CHAPS or JACHO)

To clinicians who've had to be out of office for 4 weeks and work solo: how did you go about referring patients who needed seen while you were away, did you lose patients, what was it like to rebuild your caseload? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Most of my clients have preferred to wait until I return, so rebuilding a caseload isn’t a problem.  

If needed, I referred my clients to other local practitioners if needed — a mix of other cash PTs, insurance-based PT, and chiro.

I found that being out really isn’t a problem.  Most folks have been to other providers they can return to or already see multiple people. 

Initially I tried to hire another PT, but that didn’t workout.  I’ve learned that I’m best working independently.

> **Response 2:** I had to get an independent contractor with the same credentials cover for me while I underwent emergency appendectomy. I think its always prudent to have a good relationship with a contractor who has same credentials as you.

2023 Appropriations bill text released. Congress proposing to only offset 4.47% conversion factor decrease by 2.5% in 2023. This means we will have a 1.97% decrease in 2023.   

In addition, Congress is proposing to extend outpatient therapy delivered via telehealth through December 31, 2024.   

Congress did not insert any language regarding changes in supervision requirements of an assistant in the private practice setting.   

Congress proposing to cover lymphedema compression garments beginning January 1, 2024.

Cancellation policy for mobile practice...
I have an outpatient mobile PT practice that is growing. I haven't needed to worry too much about cancellations because if someone cancelled I have been able to move someone up. With my practice growing and having other PTs, I'm wondering what others are charging for a cancellation. Specifically if a therapist shows up and the patient declines for whatever reason. I understand emergencies happen, a patient may wake up sick for their 9am appointment, etc. It's more for the patient that decided to go to lunch at 1 when they knew their appointment was at 1 and the therapist showed up, even called the patient the day before to confirm.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Full session charge for less than 24 hours cancellation. I generally don’t charge for the first late cancel and give them the benefit of the doubt.

> **Response 2:** I charge the full rate if they dont cancel within 24 hours. Its in the paperwork

Has using AI scrib for documentation saved time? Is it worth it and one once you learn how to use it? Is there one that you love that integrates with an EMR? If so which one?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Prediction health is what our clinic uses. 
Daily notes now take 2 min
Initial eval- AI records session with pt consent, then summarizes information, you then review and edit the content, recording is then deleted, it also generates potential goals for you to approve. 
So you can use as much or as little information that has been generated. 
Has saved a significant amount of time. 
I no longer have to do any doc time in the evening after work.

> **Response 2:** There’s been other posts about this.  But Jane has their own ai.  I’m still getting used to it.  Hasn’t saved me time yet but others swear by it!

How do you set up your scheduling software if you are mobile? It can’t be on the hour…🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I schedule myself so I can have control over when I see them. Based on exactly where they live. I try to keep patients closer together so there's no backtracking and it's more efficient. I use Google Calendar and love it.

For my own sanity I schedule one week at a time. When I'm approaching their final visit of the week, I ask if there are any upcoming appointments that I need to know about. Then I go ahead and schedule them for the next week. 

I do this because at least one patient has some conflicting appointment that causes me to have to change their time slightly. And their appointments tend to change or get canceled. 

Generally allow 30 minutes in between visits for any documentation time, if I run late, traffic etc.

> **Response 2:** 1 hour slot, 30 min travel and/or doc time.

Hi everyone! I have a question in regards to virtual sessions. I have an individual reaching out for virtual sessions, but I technically wouldn’t be offering skilled PT services. How should I go about getting consent for wellness signed virtually? And then what apps/system would you use to send exercises and activities to them?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use everfit for HEP and my wellness programs. It has forms you can send to the client for them to fill out

> **Response 2:** Your EMR or everything in Googlesuite  ( Docs) etc . Or DocuSign 

Have you set up your business with all of this yet ? Have your terms and conditions, disclaimers? Consent to treat ?

I’m sponsoring a local running event in a few weeks and I‘ll be able to set up a booth to market my services (my business is specifically marketed toward runners). 

For those who have done this before, what were your most effective strategies to convert on the leads you got? 
I’ve seen some posts mentioning that freebie items like pens, magnets end up being a waste of money, so I’d like to avoid any rookie mistakes if I can. 

Any ideas appreciated, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a runner I agree to not a bunch of freebies. The local PT practice in my area sets up a mini recovery tent with a table for some stretching then a chair with compression boots and some self use foam rollers and thera guns and yoga mats on the ground. Attracting people with therapy gadgets that are reusable and require people to stick around 5-10 minutes creating conversation and not just passing by grabbing something free off a table.

> **Response 2:** Agree with above. What would you want after a race that’s not offered? 5 min stretches, theraguns, rollers, etc. things runners might use but don’t bring with them to a race. Collect emails definitely, but also ensure their contact info won’t be shared. Maybe offer a handout (given after engagement) with simple recovery tidbits. You want to make sure you understand their needs so they come to you for answers

I spoke with a lady today about doing some admin work and calling leads for me.  She would be working remotely.  She only wants part-time work and that is all I have anyway, but my concern is that she is overqualified.  Before she had children she was a real estate agent.  

I really liked her but I'm afraid my offer $/hour will not be enough.  How much do you all pay for admin that includes calling leads, using GoHighLevel, Active Campaign, checking insurance benefits?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don't be afraid to offer and negotiate. This is where your business and leadership skills comes into place. Start low and go up higher versus high and then you can't afford to pay here. If that made sense. Good luck and you got this!!!!

> **Response 2:** Keep in mind, not to toot my own horn, but I've taken jobs that I'm over qualified for. Flexibility and remote is the most important benefit for me. I'd take lower pay for the Flexibility to care for my family.

Do you pay for documentation time? Why or why not? Does that change if all your treatments are 1 on 1? Does it change based on patient population? Or what EMR you use? I need guidance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Nope. Documentation shouldn’t take long. 1 on 1 pelvic health clinic

> **Response 2:** It’s just me so far but I plan to. How many industries get away with requiring work to be done but not paying the employee to do that work? 
It also really punishes neurodivergent clinicians who physically can’t just knock out documentation quickly. 
I think there are way to balance it when you pay for that time, allowing a certain percentage of paid time for admin tasks including documentation, communication with referral sources, etc. 
the practices I’ve seen who schedule paid documentation time also seem to have happy employees who aren’t burning out like crazy.

What else would be necessary to treat that I can attain in the next 2 days along with the HIPAA and normal medical hx form? Also, treating in TN if that matters!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are cash-based, then HIPPA forms are not required.  You can certainly have people fill them out, but not required.

> **Response 2:** Tyler, it is always good practice to have a 24 hr Cancellation/No-Show Policy for them to sign.   This way you can reinforce as needed.   CONGRATS & GOOD LUCK with your first client!!☺️

I am a PT and have a mobile, cash based wellness business as a side hustle. I'm planning on going full time in my business soon. In order to boost business I plan on switching my model from wellness to PT. I want to remain cash only (no insurance, no Medicare). I'll accept payment upfront and provide patient's a superbill. My question is: what else do I need to have in place that I'm not thinking of? I already have: LLC, liability insurance, consent form, superbill template (although not currently used). Anything else? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Either documentation that you create or an emr system that you purchase.  

Other intake such as medical history form.

> **Response 2:** It’s going back a bit since I worked without an emr but I believe a plan of care and daily notes are separate from a superbill.  

If direct access, follow your state guidelines on signage, dated signatures and limitations (for example California only allows 13 visits or 45 calendar days)

I need some guidance. We have a patient (workers comp case) that just started. He has had an eval and one treatment. He has already made us extremely uncomfortable and we are fearful of being caught in litigation because of him. He continues to cancel his appointments but accuses us of not wanting to see him. He is also very accusatory of his surgeon. What steps do we need to take to protect ourselves? Can we choose to no longer accept him as a patient? What constitutes patient abondonment? We are documenting conversations so that we have it in file.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you have a policy on cancellations? I've dc'd patients for multiple late cancels before.

> **Response 2:** Also, keep in mind Workmen’s Comp patients are not automatically “priority cases”. It sounds like …maybe I’m just reading between the lines… but if you don’t have their ideal appointment spot for them, then they are accusing you of not wanting to see them but remember that these patients are not priority patients. meaning they don’t take priority over other patients that are already on your schedule, so you have no obligation to see them at their “on demand” or requested time and the best you can do is work with what you have available. Then potentially DC if the schedules are not lining up.

Hey everyone! I know similar questions have been asked, but I just started my cash based practice with my first week of clients last week. I had a woman reach out to me from social media who wants to work with me for coaching purposes. She's based in the UK. Legally, this is okay to do as long as consent and intake forms are completed addressing that I am NOT her physical therapist nor treating under my DPT license?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** AI answered this.

Yes, you can provide coaching services to clients located in the UK as long as you have the appropriate consent and intake forms in place. You should also make sure that you are aware of any local laws and regulations that may apply to your practice. Additionally, it is important to make sure that you clearly communicate to your client that you are not providing physical therapy services and that you are not licensed to do so.

Need to decide on an EMR for private PT practice (just me). Jane vs Intake Q??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s just me and Jane is perfect. I pay extra for the insurance one so I can generate superbills very quickly . There is so much Jane does that eliminates the need for an admin role and really helps me with my adhd. My only downside is the fact they don’t have fax integration or messaging but they are working on that. Since I’m mobile I have to make the schedule too but it would be cool for patients to be able to schedule themselves

> **Response 2:** I've only had Jane but their customer service is really amazing.  I pay for more than I need as a cash based service but I wouldn't consider anything else given how they will answer any question or have a solution, and they are ALL so incredibly friendly and professional.  It's quite remarkable in this day and age!

Hi 👋🏼 I’m currently a solo practitioner in rural Colorado. Business is going really well and I think I need to hire someone to prevent a really long waitlist. Any suggestions of how to go about hiring someone? 
I’m in Strasburg, CO for reference

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don't forget to look at the numbers so you can determine your ROI. How many patients will you be able to provide for your new hire? How many would you need them to bring in? 

It is a good idea to build out the habit of knowing your numbers, especially before you wake up 5 years from now and have so many more moving parts!

> **Response 2:** That is awesome! Congratulations on business going well! I'm just south of you in Elizabeth!

Looking for advice from those that have scaled a solo practice:  I currently have a solo cash based practice in one room   Average 25ish visits a week.  I have the opportunity to rent a larger space with 3 treatment rooms, better visibility and in the same strip mall Im currently in.  I enjoy the freedom I have not dealing with any co-workers.  But  I have concerns over long term viability if I don't expand and would like to build an asset.  I am considering hiring a part time PT (if I can find one) at 15-20 hours/week.  What are the pros and cons and other considerations I need to consider? TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In my opinion you have to at bare minimum grow to where you have at least 1 person underneath you solely for the reason of being able to take vacation and god forbid you get hurt or sick. The business has to cash flow while you’re out otherwise you just have risk. 

Starting part time is a great idea. I would make sure you have 3-6 months of payroll in the bank and an emergency fund prob 3 months of operating costs. I would also start building credit by establishing LOCs at various banks (do this while times are good because when you need it it’s hard to get). 

Once you have that established a part time hire is a great way to go. Just don’t bite off more than you can chew.

> **Response 2:** Have you thought about hiring a PTA instead? You can do evals and PNs and they do the treatments. See if you can legally bring them on as a contractor.

The biggest benefit to building a team is that you can take off time (sickness, kids soccer game etc.) while the company continues to run and patients still get seen. You can 
 make a lot more money. You can build a company that has value if you ever want or need to sell it.

Cons: a lot of new work, new learning, your no longer just a PT, you have to learn how to hire, train, lead,oversee etc. operations have to be decent, learn a lot of laws, learn payroll, HR etc etc etc.

It’s not for everyone, and while it is definitely the “glamorous” position to be in, I wouldn’t recommend it if you are not fully in it. Sometimes you don’t know if you are built for it until you try it though. For me, I enjoy it but I don’t think I can do it forever.

There is no correct answer, you need to look at what you want to build and decide if you want to take on a new job that you have no experience in. What is the goal? How much do you want to grow? What do you want your life to look like? If you have a family, what are their thoughts with you taking on a new position filled with more frustration and challenges.

If you have any specific questions, I’d be more than happy to help out.

Ps. I purposely don’t proofread these kind of messages so that it comes out honest and raw, and not sugarcoated in any way.

Business can be simple.

We have been talking a lot at Uncaged about what it looks like to have a “boring” business.

A business that:
- 1) has a way to manage your money properly
- 2) brings in leads efficiently
- 3) Has a sales process that works
- 4) Delivers an exceptional service and is able to measure how effective the delivery is

We should be focusing on building simple, effective, and “boring” businesses.

Nothing flashy, which isn’t always sexy to business owners, but rather something that is truly sustainable for your business and your life. 

Which area above (1-4) do you need to work on becoming more simple, effective, and “boring”?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ....all of these. 😅

> **Response 2:** 1. Part of the problem is getting reimbursed in a timely manner (HH therapy staffing. I bill the HH agency). As of right now I have $17,000 outstanding.

Edit: I work with children so their parents are millennials and younger.  

For mobile providers- what does your intake process look like?  Do you have a “discovery call” first?  How do you schedule your patients?  I’m wondering if clients are turned off by the phone call and would rather communicate via email.  I’m a little old school and like to have that call first.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm a mom of a child with disabilities. I can tell you most parents would appreciate this. I don't want to waste my time if it's not a good fit. So it makes me feel like the therapist is doing the same. Again, appreciated

> **Response 2:** Definitely a phone call & my patients want that as well. Both ends to feel it is a fit & addressing their needs. I also feel they want to be comfortable with someone coming in their home also.

Hi everyone!

I've been accepting cash only for PT services but have been getting more people asking if I take HSA/FSA funds so I am considering starting to do that. Is there any additional paperwork I need in order to accept these forms of payment? If accepting HSA/FSA comes with additional rules, does anyone have any good resources outlining them? I am located in NH if the state matters.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm also in VA. I've used Square and currently use intakeq. For both systems as long as I'm registered with them as a healthcare provider the client can just process the HSA/FSA as they would a normal credit card. 

There's no additional documentation requirements. Sometimes they may need to submit a superbill for proof the funds were used foe medical/health services, but this hasn't been necessary for any of my clients as my business is registered as healthcare with my payment systems.

> **Response 2:** I’m cash based in VA. I use a payment app (HIPPA compliant) called IvyPay

The family puts CC directly into there for payment. It actually also allows the family to put in HSA or FSA accounts if they prefer to pay from those

Question for those using square for scheduling and payment. I just got my first client scheduled and it looks to me like with the free version of square my options are 1. It won’t keep a card on file or 2. It charges at time of me accepting the booking. I was wanting to keep a card on file and charge at the time of appointment (versus at time of acceptance). Is this right? And if so, Any suggestions?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I can keep a card on file for the free version. Go into customers and then add card, don’t do it right from their appointment slot.

> **Response 2:** I’m doing this now. I have prepaid appointments so charged when accepted by me works well. 

The client has the option of clicking a box that will OK keeping the card on file or removing it. I need to look into this further though. There might be a way in your settings to require the card held on file. I’ll let you know what I find out.

**AW RITE! AW RITE! AW RITE!**

It's the First Friday of 2025!

Let's *KICK IT UP A NOTCH!!* 🥳

First, I want to acknowledge that I've been a little absent the past two weeks.  

Lesson: It's OK to not GO-GO-GO allllll the tiiiiime.  

That being said, today's list might be a little shorter than usual. 

But let's give ourselves some grace.  It was the Holidays!!

I hope you all enjoyed them!

Here we go....

Someone posted a couple of days ago if it really was viable to start a cash based practice.  Let's roll the tape on UNCAGED PATHWAY student, Matt Davis.  He is 7 months into the program and he just hired his SECOND person (one is a trainer, the new hire is a PT)! WAY TO KICK IT UP, MATT!! LET'S GOOOOO!!

Perseverance and trusting the process.  That's what Jessica Kerr did in 2024.  The result? In 2023 her practice, Allied Therapy Partners saw 138 patients.  That number jumped in 2024 to 914 patients served!! KICKING IT UP A NOTCH!!!

Also growing her practice, **NeuroAxis Rehabilitation Services**, is Kelsey Harris!  This Beast of Western PA is hiring both PT and OT to add to her already amazing team!!

Matt Bonander grew his Famousity AND his practice!  He appeared in the local *The Cross Timbers Gazette* about his practice, **Focused Care PT**, opening a new location! CONGRATS!

Also growing a big dose of Famousity was Jeremy Sutton! He appeared on a KSLA News 12 (Shreveport - Bossier City, LA) segment talking about the second edition of his book, *Neck Pain Solutions*! But, WAIT! THERE's MORE!  Jeremy appeared on the show a week or so earlier talking about ***Senior Day*** - a day that he founded where he treats senior citizens in the area to gifts, etc.! This physical therapy owner of **Healthy SBC** is going places!!

This MAY have been announced a while back, but Ashley Tunquist is going to be expecting her 1st baby in about 2-4 weeks!! 

Lots of people are growing, and I love it!! Eric Otero is growing his team at **Pinnacle Movement and Performance **in Delray, FL, and his looking to hire a PT!! LET'S GOOO!

In the Austin, TX area? My man, Stephen Dunn, is looking for a unique therapist to work in his manual therapy, Pilates, and Gyrotonic clinic!  

Shana Yap Townsend is a proud momma.  Her son, Jack, earned his Communications degree from San Jose State University!

Jackie Raymond DeLuca is riding high going into 2025. She got married!! CONGRATS!!!

Speaking of babies.... CONGRATS to Michelina Richardson Baker who welcomed her little man, Archer Michael, into the world!

Remember, unless you change something - a habit, a behavior, etc., then this New Year will be just another year! LET'S GROW in 2025!!

Make it a *fantawesome* weekend, everyone!

I'm excited to get back in the saddle!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks boss!

> **Response 2:** Hahahaha! I wanna see you in a saddle! 😂😂😂

I have set up a decent mobile cash pay business in my area. I don’t necessarily need to hire employees, but I have had a couple of therapists express interest in learning more or working for me under my business.

Would love to chat with anyone who has set up this type of model to weigh my options. I would definitely be interested in expanding to have therapists working under my business on their own, but need some insight on costs/benefits to decide if it’s worth it. 

Open to any advice or conversations! Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following.. seeing EMR cost differences with >1 clinician and anticipate some (minimal) training time. I was planning to have others as 1099 employees and handling their own caseload. Still looking into it bc not ready just yet

> **Response 2:** Feel free to DM me, I’m in Arkansas and recently (within the past 6 months) switched from 1099’s to W2 employees.

Hiring vs finding a minority partner… I’m at the stage where I am thinking about hiring but at the same time I feel like if someone has part ownership they will likely to work harder for it. Plus, after being uncaged, I would like to encourage others to do the same. Anyone want to share what they have done or would do differently?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would recommend never ever taking on a partner. I've seen too many nightmare breakups. 

There are many other options including  simply co-marketing or partnering with her business to share clients/virtual assistants/etc. 

Or, just hire another therapist.

> **Response 2:** Hire someone for minimum wage plus a phantom equity deal, good compromise between an employee and a partner.

Hello everyone, I am still posting anonymously because I am still working full time in my PT mill but as soon as I am out, I will start posting normally. 

Question for those who use Jane. 
I am going to provide OON services for physical therapy

Wellness/physical therapy

Group exercise classes

Is jane good for all of those, how to the 3 tier plan compare based on my needs?
Also, invoicing and receiving payments. Is using jane a good way to do this or would I be bleeding money?

Thank you :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jane is great for this— use integrated payment software, Jane payments, for ease. I did all of these things in my practice (switched from PTE to Jane and was very happy with the switch).

I have a free month code (I don’t receive money in return to give you the free month code). Lex1mo is the code, you can test it out using that!

> **Response 2:** If you want to go the least expensive way… use google workspace for $6/month.  
I don’t need a sophisticated EMR since I’m not in network with insurance.  I have all my charts organized in good workspace.  I do square and business Venmo to receive payments

Hi there, I have a patient with two separate prescriptions given on the same date for left shoulder and right ankle for physical therapy. Can we see him on for eval for both body parts on same day or must they be done on separate days?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I recommend separate evals.  Not only for billing purposes as mentioned above, but also for demonstrating progress.  Progress notes get complicated if progress is made with one body region and not the other.

> **Response 2:** If it’s the same payer can’t you just do them in the same eval?

It comes with an app for you and clients that is HIPAA secure that includes scheduling, charting, payment, HEP, secure messaging and reports. The app for patients gives prompts for HEP and appts. It includes online scheduling, facing through the platform and e fax from your email. I’m happy to answer any questions! Feel free to ask here or DM me. If you do end up going with PTeverywhere, I think I have a referral code somewhere :)

Documentation/Billing system advice, please… I have a small mobile neuro PT practice that is currently cash-based.  I document using good ol’ fashioned SOAP notes using pen/paper.  But, I’m in the process of credentialing with Traditional Medicare, and I’m looking to acquire a  VERY SIMPLE, yet EFFECTIVE documentation/billing system to use moving forward.

What system do you find to be the most effective for a small practice?

**Community Responses:**

Those of you who are insurance based-how do you handle Initial Evaluations who no show? We have a cancellation policy for current patients and honestly we do really well with compliance once we eval people. But we're in a slump where our initial evaluations are not showing up which is just killing us. Any ideas?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Often times this comes back to the first phone call. 

Are these leads referrals? From advertising ? 

You want the client to excited and ready to come in for a visit. 

Maybe they weren’t a fit or weren’t ready to schedule or they have fear doubt and uncertainty about whether this is the next right step for them. 

Has anything changed about your front desk process

Other question would be how far out were they booked? Sometimes more than a week out people will start to no show etc

> **Response 2:** We call everybody on Fridays for the upcoming week and make sure everything is good to go

Not completely a business question- but I am looking to buy a new laptop to use for documentation and other business things. I am looking into purchasing an IPad Pro. However, have an android phone as I have not completely transitioned over to Apple. I like an all in one system so regardless of what provider I use (google or apple) things are accessible from everywhere.

Having said that, many CEUs I am now taking provide their slides or notes via PDF. How do you guys take notes on your devices? Do you have an app you use and love? Looking to see what’s there as this impacts my decision to buy the Pro. It is quite expensive but if it does the job, it maybe worth it!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No apps. But I utilized a virtual assistant to start my notes. I use a regular Lenovo laptop and it works great. Thanks!

I am a mobile PT who sees several private clients at their homes. On Friday, I arrived to my client's home (~25 min away) that I have been seeing regularly, 2-3x/week since June, with minimal to no scheduling/cancellation issues. As I pulled into their complex, they texted me (at 11:22 for an 11:30 appt) to cancel as apparently the client was ill. I believe that to actually be the case, but wasn't given any more details besides that. I decided to enforce a small fee (less than the cancellation policy fee/session cost, because it was illness related) to cover my childcare fees as I had set up a babysitter to allow me to get to the session (which was my only session of the day) and I had already arrived. I called and explained this to the patient/spouse, and they paid, but I feel maybe were not happy about this. 

 I am mom, and also a human and totally understand things happen! I have had clients cancel same day, several hours before due to legitimate reasons and not enforced my cancellation policy. I am curious what people do about a cancellation that occurs if you've already arrived to the client's home for a session? Do you just enforce your regular cancellation policy as if it were a no-show?  My clients are very committed and respectful, so I think this is a one-off, but just wanted to gain some perspective from everyone. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Did this client know about your cancellation fee? Do you go over this when you do your initial paperwork?

> **Response 2:** Since you said that the cancellation fee/policy is in your paperwork and reviewed with the client, then I would 100% charge this. I am also mobile and if someone was to cancel with 8 minutes to go to their appt, I would charge them my full cancellation fee. The only way I wouldn't do this if it was a super extenuating circumstance, i.e. they got into a car accident on the way home from errands. From your example, this client very likely knew they were ill before 11:22am - if they woke up at 9am and felt ill, they should have notified you as early as possible. I get it that some circumstances are different, but they need to respect your time.

Looking for advice on publishing a special populations wellness book. I have the bulk of the content done but am stuck on a few aspects:

-how much time/money to invest on formatting and graphics until I figure out if it will be self publishing vs sending manuscripts to publishers (who I assume would give input and have their own team to assist with that). 
-Is Amazon KDP what others of you used or are there better self publishing options if that’s the recommended route? 
-Do I need to set up an LLC now (or ever) just for publishing? I worry since the book is exercise/wellness despite multiple disclaimers it could be a liability. 

Thanks for any guidance. I feel stuck and really am hoping to get this out.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We did a session on this at a summit in June.. where are you at in the process. KDP is definitely a great route to start with.

> **Response 2:** I just published my first book last week, went through KDP since I was a newbie at this. Didn't check out other self-publishing options; needed to get it out. I can answer a couple of your questions: 
--I wanted a good quality book, so I invested $$ in editing and cover design/graphics and illustrations. With self-publishing, your deadlines are your own, not dictated by a publisher (pros and cons for that). Find a graphics person who understands and follows copyright laws! Found out that the formatting had to be done by me or my husband as I couldn't give account access to my cover artist. THAT took a long time and energy. On the flip side, I don't have to pay any publishing, printing, or distribution costs with KDP. 
--I published in KDP as an individual author and not through my business. Thought that doing this would allow me to use it as an educator and advocate and not just my PT clinic's product. Hope that makes sense!
--I get it, it is easy to get stuck at this phase. Trust me that this Uncaged group is great at helping you get unstuck! Right Sharon Gaffney-Wisnewski Josh Payne?? 🙂

I reached out to a healthcare law firm about a month ago, to which they quickly scheduled me a consult call and I was happy to book with them. I paid the retainer fee on September 12, along with two inquiries in my email to get the ball rolling. I have not gotten any help since, now at almost a month after paying. I emailed them to let them know I was still waiting, to which they politely apologized stating that they’ve been busy with hearings, and they would get back once they had a clearer picture of their timeline. That email response was over a week ago now and it’s holding my business back from growing to hire on more clinicians. 

All this to ask— is this normal??? While I respect their current clientele and trials to attend to, I am also a paid client and am losing out on money while I wait on them. I’ve expressed this to them that my business has to be on hold until I can receive the contracts I’m asking of them. TIA!

We are close to possibly hiring a PRN OT. I say PRN because this lady is not looking for full time or part time Hours, but still wants to see clients after she retires. I really think it's a perfect opportunity but am nervous! How is the transition for hiring a 1099 employee?! Any pros or cons to think about?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't understand the legalities, but my previous employer had PT/OT/SLP, but only one of our locations had more than just PT. Something about having been zoned or coded for billing for another discipline. And the other locations weren't set up like that, so only OT at the one site

Hi everyone. For anyone that went uncaged and has employees. How do you handle benefits? Specifically in NY. We’re a small agency and I’m trying to build a team of like minded therapists. I know this is going to sound crazy, but it’s not about getting rich. I honestlytly working on creating an agency thats morw like a family- where we value work/life balance. Happy therapists make for happy clients.
I do have a W2 (SLP) and a few 1099s (billing person and therapists who have full time jobs and are looking for a few extra sessions a week). I’d like to add more w2s but can’t compete with big agency benefits. Things like maternity leave and health insurance are hard to cover when you’re just a tiny rural agency. I do offer money towards insurance every week, paid billing/notes, and mileage, as well as Fridays off.  But if I paid maternity, I would essentially be using my own pay (I have a full caseload) to pay for the 6 week paid maternity for my employee. I can’t afford to do that and it’s been a deal breaker for some potential employees. Any advice on this would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I honestly think a lot of companies mislead their employees. A PT I interviewed said her company gives 8 weeks full paid maternity. I’ve never heard of any company doing this. It would be great if they did, but I don’t think anyone could/does.

> **Response 2:** Short term disability can cover maternity leave. Check out Sun life

Help!  I am a new mobile provider and have been open a few months.  I recently hired a PTA as a contractor from another company I had worked for.  I know they did a background check on him but I did not do one myself and do not have a copy of that one.  I just got a call from an ALF where he has seen a few people for me and they report that he has made inappropriate sexual comments to several people there including residents and a staff member.  None so far that I know of were our patients.  I am just not sure how to handle this.  Of course I won't be using him anymore and he will not be allowed back in that building.  What is my liability here?  I am not sure how to handle this and how much info I can or should give out to the building administrator.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Glad you are firing him. I’m not sure about liability but if you wanted to make a difference there. I would show up myself and treat those patients until you find another therapist.

> **Response 2:** I learned a lesson from a situation similar to this is you should have a background check even on your contract therapists as well as they should have their own liability insurance that you have a copy of their certificate. So that way if anything come up you can provide your insurance with that information.

Debating on hiring my first PT/potentially OT 

1099 vs W2 (in FL) 
I’m a bit torn about this. I understand the main difference and the tax liability and offering benefits with W2. 
However, it makes me a little bit nervous to hire a 1099 because I want some control over what they do. I feel like I’ve worked very hard to build my company and my reputation in the way I treat patients/family and don’t want to have no control over my contractor.

Any thoughts on W2 part time or PRN without benefits? 

For biz with multiple disciplines, how did you learn about documentation and billing for other disciplines as well as rules and regulations? I’m considering bringing on an OT in August.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Something to keep in mind is that ANY hire is an investment.  You hire for these reasons:
👉 The hire gives YOU time back
👉 The hire fills a need 
👉 The hire allows you to make more money

True, you have extremely limited “control” over a 1099; however, consider the possibility of bringing on someone as a 1099 with the goal / incentive of them moving into a W2 position.

> **Response 2:** Han Nguyen you'll have absolute control over your contractor. Not happy with what they do? Stop giving them patients. They will sign a contract with you and should understand expectations. You can require a 30 day and a 90 day (or whatever time frame) employee assessment.

Other industries have AI handling complex tasks, but my EMR still makes me manually enter the same patient info in five different places. Why am I paying for a system that can’t even automate the basics?

**Community Responses:**

Just had my online consult with Jane and loved the setup! Planning to be cash based, solo practitioner. Others in my shoes who currently use Jane, what have you liked or disliked about it? 

If so
- does Jane integrate well with whatever website hosting service I choose? 
- what do you use for your practice’s email? I see a lot of people on here recommend Google Workspace. (HIPAA compliant with BAA)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Google workspace + Jane + Squarespace website. I have seriously never encountered better customer service than Jane. They are constantly working on new features and I’m beta testing their AI voice to chart feature right now and it’s fantastic.

> **Response 2:** I’m a solo practice owner and I use Jane I love it. As far as integrating it into your website it’s super easy to just link it to a button on your website to schedule with a scheduling link. For email I use my hosting platform which is Wordpress

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What’s your goals? Really depends on where you want to go. If you just want to side hustle forever then just use a hippa compliant version of google workspace. 

If you have intentions to make this the main thing then I’d bite the bullet and get an emr. 

Jane app and PTEverywhere are likely the 2 main ones you will see recommended. 

I’ve seen both used. In a lot of the practices we work with. Let me know if you had more specific questions

> **Response 2:** I like PTEverywhere, but we do hybrid of cash and insurance.

For those using Jane, how are you handling the No Surprises / Good Faith Estimate? Do you incorporate it into intake paperwork? Separate form? Something else? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have two separate ones, one for the initial eval and another for ongoing treatment sessions (basically exactly same form but different numbers). I have the eval one as part of the intake forms and the ongoing session one I do as a note in their chart at the initial eval so they sign it and it’s more accurate regarding my recommendations.

> **Response 2:** I believe the rules say it has to be sent separately from other forms. Stupid, but…

I would like to offer a post prostatectomy program, fully online.  Like a module based program.  Since there is no eval and no individualized treatment plan, I'm thinking I can market it as a self paced educational program available to people outside the state I'm licensed in.  I've seen books like this so I think with the proper disclaimer it should be fine.  Anyone doing anything like this?  Any thoughts?

What is a nice way to send an email about cancellations? How should I nicely introduce a cancellation policy? Do I have to have current patients sign it or just let them know? Any ideas?! I keep getting ditched these last two weeks, I know people are busy right now, but still. My time needs to be respected.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following because I have a similar issue. My plan was to institute a new policy effective Jan 1 - cancellation/no show policy and a fee for nonpayment of invoices after a certain time period, as I’m also having an issue with that, albeit a much smaller problem than the cancelations.

> **Response 2:** I give out a form that the clients sign with initial paperwork stating that my cancelation policy is a $100 fee for less that 24 hours notice. The first time a client cancels without rescheduling I remind them that they sign this form in the initial paperwork and tell them that this time I will not charge them but any future cancellations will be charged. I also make them understand that by them canceling last
Minute they are preventing another client from receiving care. People usually think that is reasonable and will respect your time going forward. If you have a repeat offender that never keeps appointments I would just tell them that you can not keep them on your schedule but we happy to try to accommodate same day visit if they call and you have availability. For what it’s worth I’m cash pay except for Medicare

Question for all mobile therapists:
Does anybody have an electronic/e-signature/docusign type of system that they use to have patients sign before/after each visit? I am trying to transition away from using pen and paper treatment signature logs towards an electronic type of signature recording. Ideally, I want a system that will allow me to request an in-person signature by handing them my tablet or smart phone, have them sign it, and have the system store it in each patient’s individually created folder, that way all of each patient’s signatures are stored and organized in one place and easily accessible rather than having random signatures over all patients all over the place in a master folder. All insight and advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In Jane you can collect signatures for each visit and each signature would be tied that specific treatment note.

> **Response 2:** I do exactly that. I have them sign my tablet by hand. I use Adobe. Once they sign then I save their forms to their personal folder.

Hey everyone! Pretty excited - I just got an opportunity to have a booth up at a 5k race to offer free injury screens and short post-race stretching sessions. All I had to do was look up local races and ask! This will be my first event - any suggestions or ideas for me to bring or do? I will obviously have my table, sign-in/consent and business cards with me. Anything other ideas? Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** People love show and tell. So any of your ‘gadgets’ that you can let them touch/ explore, they will be enticed to that. Freebies if they fit in your budget. You’ll be surprised to see how many stop by just for a free pen! But make them earn it. Let them do a few stretches to earn a certain freebie! I did a booth a while ago and the person next to me literally had people play the ‘operation’ game and then have them ‘spin the wheel’ to get a free hand lotion that they purchased from dollar store! People were lining up to their booth 😂

**Original Post:**
For those who  work in NJ and have hired contractors (1099) how? I just heard of the abc rule from my part time gig, in which my employer is okay paying me as a 1099. However he states if the state came to audit and penalized him,  he'd like for us to have an agreement that the fines would be passed on to me to pay. He'd obviously would like for us to come to an agreement and wanted to educate me on the rule before we decide which way to go as payment.

I know some people are probably going to say than it's time to quit and go uncaged. While in all honesty  I'm on that path, I still need this gig since I'm not at full capacity to run. The other part is I am just having a hard time understanding the law. Is there a loop hole I'm missing, because I have worked as an 1099, independent contractor before and never heard of this and am glad it was brought to my attention.

Personally and professionally id like to understand this  rule- hoping when I am fully uncaged I can  hire employees down the road! But how, since I know kany of us have hired or have been hired as an independent contractor/1099.

Thanks!

Preface; Currently working with a patient with primary lateral sclerosis. The patient is currently dependent on power WC for community mobility with family support for all transfers and maintains Fair(-) dynamic standing balance; currently using 4WW for in home mobility with significant proximal hip strength limitations. The UE coordination and fine motor strength is becoming more and more limited causing considerable difficulty with cooking with frequent forearm burns while cooking with pans.  I advised she use thin heat resistant cooking gloves but she is worried it will affect her sensation and proprioception. 

Do yall have any specific adaptive equipment recommendations so that we can keep her safe and independent from family with cooking? I may get her a pair of thin/longer cooking gloves to try out. Maybe a heat resistant lining on the outer edge of the pan?

Jane users, do you manually input cc numbers, or do you have a payment terminal?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve made it mandatory for them to enter their own cc info when filling out the intake forms

> **Response 2:** We have patients manually enter on their intake forms. 

It’s so easy. The efficiency is better than the price discount. 

Also. Patients that don’t have to whip out their wallet every visit won’t associate your treatment with an expense every visit. 

Lastly. Check the Jane fb group. People are ALWAYS selling their terminal.  You can get a good deal. But I see that people are selling way too frequently. Tells me it’s not worth it

Hello!

So we have a new PT starting in august. Really just waiting for her license to come in and she can start instantly. So I’m just guessing it hopefully comes in mid august. So maybe august 14 or august 21.

So the week of the 14th I have 7 new eval’s scheduled. I’m really hoping to be able to give these new evals to our new PT. So I wanted to re schedule them to the following week where the new PT will have her license in and she can start with them.

But i dont know how to call the patients who are already scheduled, who will have been waiting for almost 3-4 weeks to be seen that I want to move them back another week?

Because if they stay on my schedule it will be very hard to get them scheduled for follow up appointments.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** personally, if these patients waited that long, they want to see you!  To schedule them with someone isn't fair; but you may also lose patients- because why wait longer if they can't see you to begin with?
 Maybe what you can do, especially if the new clinican is a new grad is have them come "shadow" the day you're loaded with evals. 
This way patients can also see who else is in the clinic.

We had similar situations happen at a few clinics where I worked. Some patients only wanted to see one clinician because of past word of mouth and that's okay. 
However, you can use this time to let patients know, we have someone new coming in, to help with my caseload...talk that therapist up! It may work to your advantage vs rescheduling patients to a later week.

> **Response 2:** You do the evals then hand off.  Have the new therapist observe and type up the eval if you are overwhelmed.   It’s much more important to get those patients in the door to start.   If patients have to wait 4-5 weeks for PT they are much more likely to go elsewhere or no show.   🤷‍♀️

**Original Post:**
We have a new PT starting in august. 2nd week of august.

We have new referrals scheduled out till august. And I have a cancellation list of about 10-12 patients a week right now. Getting a little overwhelmed as I don’t know what to say to patients when I’m not able to give many even 2 visits a week.

For some new eval’s I have coming up. Would it be okay to transition them to our new PT’s schedule? Maybe saying something how they will be able to get in more for visits with the new PT. But then again, I don’t want them to think “why does the new PT not have a full schedule?” Maybe I’m overthinking. 

Also, was wondering when the front desk assistant calls the new referrals to schedule for august. What’s the best way to say that they will be with our new PT? A lot of people know me/my name in town. But I don’t want them to think that only I’m the “go-to person to see”

I pretty much plan on giving most/all new referrals to our new PT.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If u say we have a great PT starting with us in August, I think it should be self explanatory why they don’t have a full schedule. I wouldn’t say she is “new” because people automatically think that they are new grads.
You can also say we work very closely together and always communicate about what is going on with our patients so I will be aware of anything that needs to be addressed. -something along those lines if needed.

> **Response 2:** I would just say, we are scheduling you with XYZ therapist and leave it at that. If you make a big deal out of it, patients are more likely to question it

I've scanned through previous posts but need some clarification. A PTA reached out to us about a position. We do mobile physical therapy and bill Medicare, BCBS and cash pay. 

In ILLINOIS. PTAs require general supervision. Can this PTA treat clients that have BCBS or cash pay? I gathered that they could not see Medicare clients. What all does general supervision entail? I've never had to worry about this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes

> **Response 2:** My daughter is taking her Fl PTA law exam and as long as a PT is available by phone/video for direction that falls under general supervision

Happy Thursday y’all! 

Quick question!

Have any of my fellow uncaged mamas or expecting mamas taken out a short term disability policy? How are you handling maternity leave if taking it? will you try to hire a PRN or full time clinician to help?

TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would hire someone at least PRN, if you think you may want to stay a little longer with a new little I’d try to hire someone that would be willing/want full time hours!! I’d suggest looking/asking around for a PT and/or PTA. That’s what I’ve been doing, so far hired 2 PRN PTAs and working on a PT PRN. To help with a heavy caseload, cover when I’m on vacation/sick, to allow admin hours outside of patient care, etc. Best decision I’ve made so far this year 😉

Aflac quoted me some decent supplement policies including short term disability but most need at least 2 participating employees.

> **Response 2:** I did not take maternity leave or short-term disability.  Thankfully my business partner took over my patients and I discharged a lot of patients that were ready. There are short-term disability policies out there that are relatively inexpensive, like we just got quoted $68 per month.

Hi! I am hiring my first PT employee soon. I’m a small little niche practice (dancers) and all of my clients just use my cell phone number for questions/some scheduling. (I direct most people to book online). Do I get my employee a phone?! Do I get a business line and switch all my patients over?  HELP!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look into google voice. Still use cell phone/voicemail but will be a separate number in case the employee is more comfortable not having patients have their cell number.

> **Response 2:** Google voice number, they use their phone but get a new number and those go through the app.

Also - what are must haves for vendor booths? Business cards, swag, opt in of some kind? I’m in pelvic health. And this event ia geared towards pregnancy/postpartum.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Order a dtf transfer from jiffy transfers and iron it on a table cloth. Or go to whomever does your local rec ball uniforms, I'm sure they do this also

> **Response 2:** Haven’t done one as a vendor for myself, but observations from the customer side: services have a hard time getting people to the table vs. products that are available for purchase. I’ve seen food giveaways (candy usually) or some kind of activity (spin the wheel to get various branded swag) do well. Or offering mini services, like a hand massage for a massage therapist. Having something of your service people can actually see or experience.

For those of you that use Google Workspace for forms... How do you have patients complete these? Bring your laptop and have them do it online or send forms ahead of time? Print and upload later?  Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have Google forms that I send out to patients. The data they enter is stored in a spreadsheet, populates a template I can save as a PDF, and fills out half the history section of my eval note.

> **Response 2:** I send the forms ahead of time and have them fill it all out online. If they have trouble filling it out online, I show up early and fill it out for them on my own device.

I found that Google Forms were not very print friendly, but were great if I just let Google Workspace do its thing lol.

Hey everyone! Looking to get feedback on your follow up protocols when someone has expressed interest in booking but then doesn't get back to you. Also, how and how often you follow up after the initial visit when they don't want to book another appointment right then and there, but say they will go on the website to book. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always follow the initial evaluation with a detailed email telling them what we discussed and their exercises. At the end of the email, I remind them I typically see patients less often than a traditional therapist and ask them to reach out with their needs. After a week (regardless if they scheduled another appointment) I do a quick follow up email to make sure exercises are going well. After that, I tend to let them go as they probably wouldn’t be a good fit for me. They tend to schedule another appointment between those 2 emails though😊 Hope this helps!

> **Response 2:** Bumping because I need help, please!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Patrick Walker. So you know, nobody is looking at notes when you bill Medicare. It’s only if audited that they look at your charting. 

Short answer to your question is you need: time in and time out, SOAP format, time spent in each CPT, and response to treatment in your assessment statement. Are you asking about daily treatment note or about the 10th visit progress note?

I was wondering if anyone sells/creates EMRs based in Google Workspace. 

I was speaking with someone who runs a pro bono clinic with multiple disciplines and she is looking to use google products for scheduling, notes, and intake forms that is a bit more streamlined.

I am not sure what they currently use for scheduling, but I do know that all notes are done in google docs and forms are created in google docs, printed, and kept in a file. The main thing they are looking for is is being HIPAA compliant, cost-effective and having multiple clinicians access necessary files (which they do on google workspace currently) 

If anyone provides this or has recommendations for services or another EMR, please let me know and I can pass along your information :) TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use TherapyBOSS and really find it to be great!

> **Response 2:** in our probono clinic we have a deal with Athena for minimal cost for the EMR. It works pretty well among multiple disciplines and clinic times. Also for the MDs it connects for scripts as well as PMH.

1099 vs W2

I have a solo OT mobile practice and am wanting to bring on a COTA for some extra help. Currently it would be between 2-5 visits per week. They would have complete autonomy with scheduling and interventions completed during the visits. I’m wondering if I could pay someone higher rates and 1099 them or if W2 would be better for them? Thank you for any input - still trying to figure out the business side of all of this 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The very nature of a OTA position requires W-2 given you are in a supervisory capacity as the OT and they cannot function autonomously.

> **Response 2:** W2 is the correct, legal way to go with this. There is a podcast that Nicole Cozean and her husband did on the difference between 1099 versus W2 but ultimately if they provider has a set schedule, they are W2.

If I hire a PTA for prn work, and they make their own schedule, etc, can they ever be considered a 1099? Or would they have to be a W2 as they require supervision from a PT?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have PTAs as 1099. They make their own schedule and have the ability to decline patients. The supervision from a PT portion is a licensure requirement but doesn't mean you are telling the PTA exactly what to do and when.

> **Response 2:** I think it will really depend on how you set it up and possibly your state. I have a couple friends who were audited here and Utah and got fines. Could be an Utah thing. Could be how they set it up. I have all my PTAs as W2 just to avoid that problem.

Ive never had anyone ask to share their pt info with anyone else, so i dont have a form yet for this- but someone called asking about pt for her son, i assumed under 18- no- in his 20s. I said he has to call to schedule himself and bring his forms in person etc. i assume i need a form in case he wants to consent to her receiving any info (if he asks, but sounds like she will be paying)- anyone have one they can share for this scenario? Thanks

**Community Responses:**

Because of HIPAA the young adult must give consent for the parent to have access to their medical records if they choose to do so. I've also had adult children schedule and pay for their parents. Same rules apply. They pay and understand that unless the patient gives written consent for them to have access to any of their medical history them I cannot release it. The financial agreement indicates that the party paying is aware that their card will be charged, but ultimately the responsibility falls in the patient.

> **Response 2:** So i do with dd ddis a i just have form they full out.

Superbill question
I have someone who comes weekly cash based pt, started off for knee and foot but then randomly will have back pain- i re eval for free, work on what hurts that day, etc- for superbill do you change the icd10 codes each time or leave what they mostly come for consistently? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Leave them. Treating a different body part is related to treating the original. Everything is connected. Just document it as such.

Recently started researching about shockwave, as a OTR and as a patient myself. 

I found a local chiropractor that offers it, filled out 5 pages of paperwork prior to my appt, initial visit was with chiropractor, subsequent visits with the front desk (a receptionist that booked my appointments and charged my credit card) 

Each visit is like 180 but they offered 8 visits for 1200. 

Can I do this as a mobile clinic? Just go around and offer pain relieve treatment? 

I have the PAM cert in GA. 
Thank you for your advise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey, so I'm in GA too and I looked into this. According to the rep, yes, there is actually no requirement to administer it.  It can technically be used for mobile practice according to the rep, but it is very expensive to purchase!  I think I would only consider it if I could do it in a brick and mortar clinic and schedule clients closer together for treatments.

> **Response 2:** I believe in GA that OTs need the modalities on their license. You may have to check with the board to see if that modality is included with the modality certifications you have.

For those who use GoHighLevel and Jane App for EMR, how do you integrate all your contact info? I’m thinking about finally using an EMR (thoughts on systems you think are better than Jane?), currently use Google Workspace but want to streamline my systems to be more efficient. For context, I’m a solo mobile vestibular practice that started in January, but officially left my hospital-based inpatient and outpatient job in April. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use simple practice. That’s my only experience as solo provider currently. Works well. Patients, yoga classes etc, take payment through the EMR.

> **Response 2:** I use Jane and high level you can mass export pt info from Jane you can also sync your Jane calendar to your google calendar. My online scheduling and medical forms are all in my EHR which I think is safer for compliance etc.

Is anyone using Jotform or another app to make this easier? Would like to have a very simple form for treatment and another for dry needling consent, but an easier way to keep track instead of scanning all the paper forms in each time. I am seeing roughly 15 patients/week. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Google form

> **Response 2:** You will pay $700 a year or so for jotform. They kicked me out and won’t let me access my account  for consent forms bc I do t have the HIPPA compliant membership. I just started my business and don’t have $700 just sitting around and I am paying for basic membership on a monthly basis. Do you have an EMR? They usually have consent forms available through EMR service

Does anyone have thoughts on a scheduling system that would allow multiple individual entities (not emplyees of the same company) to schedule on the same calendar?  I currently run a wellness studio, and in June will be adding yoga and pilates contractors to the space.  We will all need access to the same scheduling calendar to ensure that clients and classes aren't overlapping in time slots and physical spaces.  We will have certain days that are ONLY yoga or ONLY pilates, but on the days where both can happen we need to see what's available.  I currently use Acuity and it's fine for just me, but I wonder if there's something better.  It does not need to be EMR... just scheduling.  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** GoHighLevel will do this. 👍

> **Response 2:** We created an email address like intake@ and tie sessions to that. Then we can overlap them in the intake calendar but not in our EMR/real life.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** I do! I use Jane and allow open booking. 70% of my clients book themselves. I can pretty much get anywhere in my radius within a half hour, so I have 30 minutes blocked between each client.

Looking into a few things for starting a cash PT practice:
* For anyone using Jane app, is it worth the extra $30/month for automatic superbills, or is it easy enough manually? I'd be looking at working up to 15-20 patients per week and providing superbills for those interested.
* Anyone renting space in a gym, how do you structure rent? I'm currently looking to work in a smaller gym space out of a martial arts (Jiu Jitsu) gym where I currently assist with teaching as well. Hourly, monthly, percentage of earnings, etc?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Jane and see a max of 15 pts/week. I do my superbills manually for those interested. Honestly only a handful of people even want a superbill. I wouldn't pay the extra money to save the few minutes it takes me.

> **Response 2:** It is fully equipped with weight training and cardio equipment so that's a benefit

Hi all. Does anyone know a way to use an IPAD for having pt sign intake forms etc that is Hippa compliant?

In theory I'd like to have the forms in something like good .notes which syncs to my google drive. But it does not look like good notes is hippa compliant.

Looking for any suggestions in becoming paper free

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Google forms?

> **Response 2:** I’m always curious about the reason for the concern in situations like this. Understanding the reason helps me. 
Is it that the iPad could be stollen & documents exposed? 
I have a tablet I’d like to use in the same way. 
If the documents are available within the EMR, then it’s a matter of confirming HIPAA compliance with the EMR, correct?

Anyone else deal with this? 

We do many thousands of visits every year but nearly all are for home health. Recently began accepting cash pay patients. 

At first I was super stoked to just accept a VenMo payment outside of our business. 

But these patients are medically fragile and not without risk. The more I think about it, the more it feels like we need to run them through our business, including documenting every thing in our EMR. 

Am I correct in thinking we should be protecting the rest of our business by using our existing infrastructure for these cases?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am all cash pay and do full documentation on all my clients. I am still responsible to them to fully assess their condition and provide intervention so I’m going to document it. 
I’m not doing the unnecessary check boxes that insurance co ask for but that’s is not the same as not documenting. 
I think we do our profession a disservice calling/treating wellness sessions as less/unskilled.

> **Response 2:** I always make a simple SOAP note in my EMR. Like someone said above, they're much shorter. But it still let's me track what's happening with my patient and I've gone back to check details of something done or said multiple times

Hi everyone. I have a question regarding PTA supervision.  I just started a job that is super busy. I work with 2 PTA’s . Each of them see at least 20 patients a day on a 11-12 hour day, while I see at least 10-12 patients mostly evals and re- exams ( yes I know this is crazy!!). My question is : is there a maximum number of patients as a supervising PT to co sign?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In Nebraska the limit is 2 PTAs per PT but no limit on visits seen.

> **Response 2:** I think this varies by state. Your practice act may have more clear guidance. In Texas, a PT can supervise as many PTAs as they feel they can adequately supervise (no patient limits)

Hello, For those who are also doing some adjunct teaching, would you be able to answer a tax question for me? I'm wondering if my W9 should be filled out as me representing my business using my EIN, or as an individual with my SSN.  Does anyone have guidance here?  I am going to email my accountant as well.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It depends on your business structure, among other things. 

First, whether you’re a 1099 or W2 at the school may depends on their policies and/or state regulations. Our university only hires as W2 now, because of changes in policy a couple years back. 

As far as what identifiers to use: my accountant said that because I’m a s-corp, I really shouldn’t also be hired as a 1099 using my SSN. He suggested I only complete them with my EIN. But it’s ok that I’m hired as a W2 through the university that I work. I don’t understand all of the ins and outs, but this is what he told me almost immediately when I switch from my old CPA.

> **Response 2:** I’m an adjunct W2

Why do you think that is?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Kevin DeGroot You’re right. Personal dev books are mostly for procrastination or to delay taking action/making decisions.

I'm inching my way towards being completely "uncaged"...my side hustle is growing so I'm going PRN with my full-time job. I'm wondering if I should ask to become a contract/1099 PT or just stick with their low rates as a W2 PRN employee? I know there's more paperwork to put in as a contractor, but I feel like I could set my own (considerably better) rates. Any thoughts from others who may have had similar experiences?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'd personally be a 1099. It has worked out well and your expenses are tax deductible under your business. I don't believe the government let's W2s deduct expenses. I'd talk to an accountant about it to help decide. I don't bill through my business. They pay me per visit. I tell them who I saw and what kind of visit, since I'm paid more for supervisory visits/evals, and that's it.

Just realized our EMR doesn’t flag expired authorizations. Keeping up with them in a spreadsheet is getting overwhelming. There’s gotta be a better way...how are you all handling this in your clinics?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Upgrade to a better EMR system. That seems like a pretty basic need all EMR systems should be able to flag for you. Give spry a demo. It’s a great system. It lets you know when you are a couple visits out from an auth expiring and flags things when the auth has expired. Never miss getting an auth and the. Fighting to get it retro or having to write off the visit. Highly recommend spry

> **Response 2:** I still have a spreadsheet, but I save the auths as actual scripts and that helps a bit. I save the updated script as “other” to make sure I have it and know when I need to get an updated one.

Help needed ASAP:)

First of all, this wouldn’t have been possible without this group for motivation and guidance. 

Finally after a long wait and hesitance on my end, scheduled my first client directly for my business. This client has Medicare and wants DN which is not covered so will be cash pay service with ABN. I will be taking DN consent form with me the state. 

What all do I need to add in my checklist before I meet the client on Friday .

Please guide me on the checklist: 

I have NPI2 for business. 

I have already enrolled in PECOS. ( I know not relevenat here).

I know I need intake forms. (If anyone can share a template , I would really appreciate it. This is for Florida state in case it helps)

I have Scheduled demo for EMR but should I use paper SOAP note until registered? 

Is there anything other than PECOS application I need from my end to bill Medicare for future clients for covered services? 

What else am I missing here? 

Any input is highly appreciated .

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can do a digital SOAP note so you can cooy and paste when you get your EMR running.

> **Response 2:** Do you have your payment methods ready?

Hi guys! For those of you with a mobile practice, how do you schedule and manage drive times between appts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I serve a relatively small area with no more than 10-12 miles between patients. Schedule each patient to allow for 15 min travel time and that it’s. Pretty easy.

Biggest improvement in my efficiency was as I got busier I just gave patients scheduling options that are ideal for me instead of saying  all my availability and letting them pick.

“I can put you on for Tuesday at 10:30” vs “Im available Tuesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, what works best for you”

> **Response 2:** Still new so just let the patients know my days in their particular area. I’m a mix of small town and rural country so I have my city days and my rural days.

I try really hard to keep rural days to 2 per week. Days in city allow for more visits per day and make up some of the lost visits on rural days.

Current rate for a 2ish year experienced PT in an outpatient setting in Central Florida, just outside of Tampa. Any feedback? Want to be competitive but not able to compete with a POP likely. 
Also, recommendations for health insurance programs or companies? It’s a small practice and over the last 13years no other employees have  needed health insurance as they were connected to a spouse. However it’s time to make the compensation package attractive.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Which area in florida? It varies from south fl to the panhandle

> **Response 2:** Since there isn’t a huge difference money wise between those who have worked 2 years and 10 years, I would recommend looking at other areas of the offer to be competitive! 4 day work weeks, time off, etc… a lot of new grads these days are looking for that type of stuff since the money is all about the same

It's FRIDAY! HECK YEAH!

Time to **KICK IT UP A NOTCH!** 🕺

*First and foremost, on behalf of the UNCAGED CLINICIAN team, I want to extend prayers out to all of those who are being or have been impacted by the hurricane.* 🙏

How about Lindsay Rush going out and crrrrushing her first RAGNAR race! YOU GO GIRL!! 

My dude, Howie Barrett, keeps growing his practice, *Get Set*.  He just added his second PT to the team! LET'S GOOO!

A couple of weeks ago we announced that Bill Johnson had added his first PT to his team at *Advantage Results Physical Therapy* (Harrisonburg, VA). Believe it or not, my man has kicked it up again by adding *another* PT to the team! BOOM SHAKALAKA!

Also growing her most amazing team at NeuroAxis Rehabilitation Services has been Kelsey Harris! She's added new peeps! DESTROYING IT!!!

First, Ashley Tunquist kicked up the relationship game by getting married a couple of weekends ago.  BUT THAT AIN'T ALL!! She has gone NEXT LEVEL by announcing that she and hubby Brandon are EXPECTING!! CONGRATS!!!

As parents, we should be the heroes and influencers in our kids' lives.  That is exactly what Kyle Womack and his wife are.  As the owners of *TheMuvCo* on Kauai, HI, they love movement and and training.  Their daughter, Linley just completed her first kids "showcase", doing what mom and dad love to do! FABULOUS!

One of the most important and valuable ways we can grow is through Education. Giving a big 'ol hand slap to Jocelyn Besa White!! Her application has been accepted for admission into the AAMT Fellowship for Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy! HUGE!!! CONGRATS!!

Last week we were stoked to announce that Christina Marie Ramirez and biz partner Camaron Chide Burney won BEST Physical Therapy in Galveston County (TX) in just their first year of operations.  Well, the honors didn't stop there. They earned the BEST award for League City, TX also!! BAMTASTIC for these recent UNCAGED CLINICIAN PATHWAY students!! (plug for the program? what plug?)

We pray for those in the path of Helene 🙏

Talk to me about your business phones. I just hired an independent contractor and am wondering what to do for the phones. Our business has a physical location and we do mobile visits as well. Should I offer two phonelines or have just the one and have it go to either one of us which can answer on our cell phone? Is this actually a service that is offered somewhere?￼ ￼￼￼I’m currently using Google Voice.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I like simple and we don’t use a business phone. We have two independent contractors with us and my husbands phone is pretty much the business line since he does most of it. And then each independent contractor will share their phone numbers to for patients to schedule directly with them

> **Response 2:** Following

I’ve heard iplum but I don’t use it (yet?).  I use sideline which has some nice features (auto text reply!)  but I’m open to other options.

Trina: I highly recommend getting a business number!  Had some weird patients in the past that I’m glad didn’t have my personal contact info.  As a former IC I refused to use my personal number with patients, so just be prepared in case others like me aren’t on board with using their personal phone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just switched EMR systems this year and had it narrowed down to prompt and spry. Both excellent systems and similar but I went with spry because it was so much less expensive including start up and onboarding (zero charge for spry) and monthly is cheaper. I am so happy with my decision. It’s been a great system with great support and a fraction of the cost of spry

**Original Post:**
I have a question regarding releasing documentation to patients with evident mental health issues... I understand that it's within their rights to request that, but how should I do it?

One of my patients decided to discharge herself because she claimed that she "felt worse and less self-worthy" every time she came to our clinic. She made a lot of false accusations and her reasoning was inconsistent, invalid and irrelevant. (She claimed that my boss was attacking her personally while my boss made comments on past employees and events that were completely unrelated to her. My boss never even worked with her once. And I got accused for not defending her and lack of compassion when I tried to clarify what my boss's words to resolve the misunderstanding.)

I'm not trying to diagnose her, but this appeared to be like persecutory delusion to me. She was a long-term patient, and over time I also learned about her several past traumas (with suicidal ideations at some point before seeing me) and attempts to seek counseling.

She told me not to document any part of the conversations. But I did and stated that "psychosocial disorders are suspected, and mental health interventions should be prioritized."

Now as she is requesting her notes, I'm not sure if we should just give her directly. I am really worried that her mental condition would deteriorate from reading my notes. To abide by my ethics, if I foresee an action that would do harm to my patient, I should avoid it, right? But can I "not" give her the notes?

How would psychologists and psychiatrists handle this? (I don't think they would be so direct in revealing that their patients have bipolar disorders, borderline personality disorders, delusion, or other conditions like that, right?)

As of now, we have already responded to her saying that we will directly fax the documentation to her provider per her request, and we will not email her the notes because it is not HIPAA compliant. So I have bought some time to ask for guidance. Thanks in advance for your response! 🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks for the input. 
My boss and I feel like this was very likely a manipulative behavior of seeking attention in a negative way, as I actually cut her off per her expression even though she didn’t truly want to be cut off. But just wanted to be prepared for any development. 

I’m aware of the patients rights to request documentation. And normally I would just give them. Like some of you said, this one was tricky. 
If she still wants the notes for herself, we’ll ask her to pay for printing, processing and shipping, while offering faxing to her provider by request for free. 

I did my best to fill up the details and even had to make some addendums. I would never even imagine that a random conversation of our past employee’s mistake locking us out of the United Healthcare portal (as an example) would be related to her ankle pain, not to mention to document accordingly.

> **Response 2:** Hi Andy! It sounds like you're being VERY thoughtful in this situation, which is good. It is tricky. Tracy is correct, you cannot deny her medical records. I would look through any mention of mental health in your notes and make sure that everything is professional and objective and non-diagnostic and you can always make addendums to justify why mental health was relevant if necessary. If you know she is currently in therapy, you can try and get a release to give her therapist/psychiatrist the medical records so they can be looped in. If you're concerned about how she will handle the notes, you can follow up with her after they are released and you can always call in a wellness check with local police if you are genuinely concerned that this could trigger SI for her. I would document all conversations with supervisors and such about the precautions you're taking, but as long as any mention of her mental health was clinically relevant to your notes as a therapist, then you have nothing to worry about legally.

Streamline Work Comp has reached out to me, and I am seeking feedback on their credibility as a company. Furthermore, they provide compensation for FCE; can anyone inform me if specific training is necessary for FCE? What steps can I take to begin the DCE process, and where should I start?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** FCE’s when done correctly are very specific and I would recommend getting training - not sure if you’re able to perform them without it in some states. 
I don’t currently perform them with my own company, but I’m thinking about it once I have the space and the equipment. 
You can do FCE’s for a WC company without having to see regular WC patients. 
When I performed them we were reimbursed ~$650 a few years ago in NC. Blocked 4 hrs to perform it.

> **Response 2:** I contracted with streamline and took a couple of patients. Honestly was not worth the amount of paperwork they required to get paid. I believe they want a progress note every 6 visits if I remember correctly. It was a lot of admin time for less than Medicare contracted rates.

Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The hospital system I just left did have intake forms in the other languages, but standardized outcome measures we did not. We just used a translation service to fill them out. Which, in the US, is required by law to provide free of charge. And family members are not allowed to translate, however, they can sign a form to waive these rights and allow their family to translate.

For those of you who use Spry EMR, what has your experience been? What do you like/dislike about it?

Considering switching to it.

Thank you all!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have been with them for a year and half now, switching from WebPT and its been great. The transition process was excellent. The front office/desk portion is great (scheduling, billing, etc.). We've noticed an increase in revenue since switching as well as higher amounts of patients paying their balances, since they receive a text message and email statement. The ability to save a card on file, like a credit card or HSA card has been great as well. We can just bill the copay to that card at the end of each visit. There are so many great features, that as office manager has made my job so much easier. You can check eligibility and benefits from the EMR directly, reducing the need to use other websites and allowing for increased productivity. Spry has been great, I believe you will be very pleased with them. Customer service is friendly and fast, we typically get a response within minutes.

> **Response 2:** You'll love it. Affordable and yet has all the features we need. We love them. switched from webpt more than a year back and i thank my stars everyday i see those webpt down posts.

Which phone/text/fax system do you use that you love?  We currently have Vonage and pay $53/month.
Pros:  phones can be answered on any phone or computer with the Vonage app.
faxes go through quickly and reliably
Cons:  phone connection is often bad
text is unreliable
technical support is impossible to reach

We must be able to keep our phone and fax numbers. We are also located in a rural area, so we don't have city infrastructure to support our communications.
Thanks in advance!

I never knew this was a thing until recently. One big reason many people must use conceirge doctors and pay cash for services. Your info will not make it here. Just think about this …one… step… deeper ☠️☠️ that means anything we do with seniors DOES make it here so health, life and LTC ins co have this info 👀

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. Been a victim of misinformation being placed in this system. Administrators read things they don't understand and then you get penalized for a diagnosis you don't have.. But if your concierge doctor uses Epic it still gets passed on...depends on the what EMR system they are using is my understanding.

For mobile practice owners. 
If you charge a cancellation fee (only for repeat offenders), how much of that goes to your Ic that lost the visit? 
My cancellation fee is almost the same as what I pay my contractors. Just give it all to them?
I need to create a policy around this but wondering what others are doing.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance #CancellationFee 
Cindy - A cancellation/no show policy should be the same for all patients;  and equally applied across the entire practice.  

How a practice determines compensation for IC (or employees) for "lost revenue" (missed visit) should be separate and distinct from a patient Cancellation/No Show policy.

> **Response 2:** I give ICs 50% of billed no show and cancellation fees, and my ICs have been fine with that so far!

**Be honest…**
If someone asked your family what kind of leader you are at home—what would they say?

It’s easy to pour our best into our business:
✅ Casting vision
✅ Motivating a team
✅ Hitting the goals

But what about the leadership that happens behind closed doors?
* Being fully present with your spouse
* Guiding your kids with consistency and love
* Living your values when no one else is watching

Your family is your first team. Your legacy begins there.

We just published a blog on **why family leadership matters just as much as business success**—and how to excel at both.

*If you have any advice or personal experience please private message me*

If my W2 employer is willing to hire me as a 1099 contractor (through my LLC) - is that a slam dunk or would there be a reason not to? 

I’ve asked this before on here and half immediately said heck yes and half responded with “well actually they can’t just do that”….. 

They can. They’ve hired another PT though their LLC/SCorp and they’re reaping the benefits (New work truck, writing off vacations, deducting portions of the mortgage/utilities/etc). 

SO… My question is do any of you have any first hand experience with this? Could any of you recommend a financial advisor/CPA that could help me? 

I’d love to work with someone that could lay out everything for me, weighing the Pros and Cons (PTO/benefits/savings/etc) vs (higher income, deductions, etc). Like if I were to go 1099, I know you’re supposed to ask for much more money hourly bc they’re no longer having to cover your benefits… I need to find someone that knows how to tread that line. TIA! 

TLDR: I have an important decision to make regarding my current job - and I’m not sure if I should just ask for more money (salary) or even consider 1099 for the tax benefits.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Bumping hoping that someone with a referral sees this

> **Response 2:** Someone would need to know your current benefits package.  i.e. PTO, con- ed, holidays, retirement, your projected health insurance costs if u cover it yourself vs what u pay now. Etc.  It's not that easy to get u the answer.  But knowing all of these answers, it shouldn't be too difficult to come up with a price point to leave.

**Original Post:**
For those whose staff are paid per treatment (rather than part time/ full time), how many gaps per day/ week/ etc do your staff get paid for.  Do you use a flat number for the day/ week or is it based on total treatments? Just looking for different ways different clinics handle this. 
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've worked as a 1099 contractor as an employee straight commission (50%+). 

I've never been paid for gaps, except when a client late cancels and the employer collects payment anyway. 

However, an employer who desires to retain employees would make every effort to eliminate long gaps and to keep the schedule full. 

I also appreciate not being required to be in the office when I have no clients on the books.

There are some employers who pay an hourly rate for admin/cleaning/etc when  therr are no appointments scheduled.

> **Response 2:** I worked as a contractor and was paid per patient an hourly rate. For the wellness patient there was a 60/40 split. I only got paid if I was seeing a patient.

Obviously I will call them, but just so I know what I'm talking about when I do... Do I need all of these for a mobile outpatient practice with me and 1 independent contractor?
(My state does require workers comp)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HPSO tends to be more expensive, but to their credit the policy they provided me includes cyber, professional, and general all in one policy. It also has a business owners extension, which I think is the equivalent of your business owners policy (BOP) as well. I don't have any employees so don't have the WC or EPI. So for me just the HPSO policy + umbrella.

> **Response 2:** You do not need work comp unless you have employees and some states only if 2-3 or more employees.

Anyone offer a type of “hybrid” position for their therapists ? Like a treating therapist / sales position? Or a treating therapist / some type of freelance writer. So like part time work from home; part time mobile therapist . Or part time mobile therapist / part time sales… etc 
Anyone do anything like this? looking to brainstorm

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To be honest. That would be a challenge. Not all therapist are like us business owners. If you find one. That's amazing. I do however have a PTA who is kinda my rehab liaison. She doesn't get paid extra to be a liaison. But definitely helps me get find new patients. And speaking of liaisons, I am actually hiring one soon. She actually hired me to speak in their senior citizen group and I offered her a part time position and bam. Win. Win. Win. For your social media needs. A remote virtual assistant will be perfect for that. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** I would love to find someone like that too since I'm not strong in sales. I know a newer home health company hired a colleague of mine for something similar and she loved it.

So I'm not necessarily uncaged,  but I just started teaching continuing education classes with 1 group and I'm on the medical advisory board for another group. Both are paid positions.  Is there any value in creating an llc or company for tax purposes.  This idea is so new to me,  I really don't know the right questions to ask or search.  Any input helpful.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What Clay Watson said 👌

> **Response 2:** 1) Talk to your accountant, if you have one. Get a referral to one of you don’t. 

2) Do the math because the answer might depend on how much the side gig pays you. 

3) If those positions had you fill out a W2, they are already paying you as an employee. That makes this a moot point because you are basically already classified as an employee.

Systems and admin can be overwhelming....

but imagine that by the end of this year you could have 
1. phone system that allows you to build out lead profiles and track how people come into your pactice 
2. scheduling systems that communicate with your EMR that allow for automations in compliance, client tracking, follow ups, reactivation campaigns, medicare tracking, etc. 
3. lead system that follows up with leads on autopilot for the next 6+ months without any extra work on your end 

and that's just the start of it. 

We're offering 6 week system building for practice owners right now where we'll help you build a custom system that fits the needs of your practice. This will save you thousands on admin and hours of time.  If you're interested in more details comment DETAILS below and we'll send you more info

**OTs: You didn’t become a therapist to feel trapped.**

💥 You became one to EMPOWER.
💥 To HEAL.
💥 To make a REAL difference.

So why does it feel like the system is working *against* you?

⛔ Productivity quotas
⛔ Rushed care
⛔ Constant burnout

**You are NOT the problem.**
The system is broken — but you don’t have to stay stuck in it.

🚀 There’s a better way forward, and it starts with reclaiming your autonomy as an OT.

This was requested from a former client?

“Could we ask for a “super bills” coded with the accident as the reason for your us needing your specialty?”

Is this actually a thing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are icd 10 codes that look at causes. My favorite is attacked by a duck W61.61.  That being said your treatment notes should have the history that shows this.  If the note is already done personally I would not go back and change my documentation.

> **Response 2:** If I'm understanding this correctly, it sounds like they want you to out on the superbill that services are related to an accident?

Superbill only has the icd-10 and cpt codes. Superbills don't justify medical necessity or cause. That's what the treatment note is for.if it is related to an accident then your documentation should indicate that.

I’m looking for a system for posting on social media.   Anyone willing to share their system from taking the videos, editing, writing copy to scheduling and posting.  What platform are you using to schedule.  Do you have anyone else that helps you with these tasks.  How do you proof their work before it posts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Canva to design and make it all. Sometimes I use Capcut, but Canva works for me. 

Just use the Facebook business suite to schedule it all.

> **Response 2:** Hootsuite and Buffer are popular and user-friendly applications for scheduling and posting on various social media channels. Consider checking them out to see which one aligns better with your needs. You can also proof read before posting these messages

Has anyone hired a PTA as an independent contractor? Note: I'm already very familiar with IRS classification rules but I'm specifically wondering if anyone has structured this in a way that works, given that PTA's follow a PT's POC.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding was that PTAs/COTAs can’t be independent contractors because they can’t practice without PT/OT supervision at some level.  They would have to be per diem or part-time.

> **Response 2:** It's not just the IRS (Feds) classification, but it is your State's classification system (wc coverage etc) that you must also adhere to.

For those with employees: do you have requirement for outside of treatment engagement in the practice? For example: social media post, workshops, presentations etc? 
What does that structure look like for your practice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Double check current laws- it was illegal for business to require employees to post or share anything on social media. Employees don’t even have to have their picture on a business website without their specific consent.

> **Response 2:** If I have them do anything outside patient treatment, I make sure I pay them their hourly wage. For context, I have a mobile practice and pay my employees per visit.

Anything you ask your employees to do, make sure you put yourself in their shoes. You are now in the business of serving your employees more than your patients.

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
Hello! I'm opening my cash based practice next month and am very excited. I've learned a lot from this group but do have a question on how people document transitions to wellness. I already have some clients lined up and one of them wants to be treated for "posture" since they work a desk job and are having pains. Now in my mind posture likely isn't medically necessary and will fall in wellness depending on impairments found, so if you do an eval under PT but determine wellness is more appropriate if any follow ups are necessary, how do you document that transition? Then let's say you're treating a patient with any diagnosis that went to wellness but their symptoms returned, how would you document the transition back to PT? Or am I over thinking this and you just set up 2 separate cases? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Jane for all documentation, even wellness visits. You can create any type of form you want. Patients have one chart but you can see PT eval, PT follow up, PT discharge and then Wellness visit. I do billing and payment through the app as well so its all in one place. (I am cash based)

> **Response 2:** Posture isn’t the icd 10. The pain is. The posture is a likely soutce of the pain. People don’t go to the ER with heart attack. They go with chest pain. So if there is affiliated pain it would be considered medically necessary …. Right??

I only did a half-hearted search. I had my first call from a patient to schedule that has Medicare. Normally I've had an MD send me an email referral with their info. How do you get a copy of their insurance card? Do I take a pic with my phone? What about HIPPA? Or do I just write all the info down? Such a basic question.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Jane for my EMR and input it right into the system. Sometimes the patient will put a pic of the card in their file during the intake paperwork

> **Response 2:** I use google drive and have a BAA with google. I take pictures and add them to the drive folder.

Happy Sunday y’all! Trying to find some thing like an electronic whiteboard or a notebook. I have an iPad and I’m trying to find an app to use and looking for recommendations. I like writing things out and being able to look back at them, kind of like journaling, or jotting down ideas. Anyone have an app that they like for that?

￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just got a Rocketbook and I love it!

> **Response 2:** Notability is a good iPad app that works like a notebook, journal, planner, etc. you can set it up however you like. 

Rocketbooks are also great if you wanted a physical notebook, because you write whatever you want then scan in their app and it turns your physical writing into a digital copy to be emailed, stored in google docs, Dropbox etc. 

I use both for different purposes and really enjoy them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a cancellation policy acknowledgment form they sign with their intake paperwork. I started with a 50% cancellation fee when I started my business 4 yrs ago. I quickly updated it to 24 hr within a few months. Decide what you can cover in the occurrence of a cancellation and include it in your intake paperwork. I think this can vary greatly on your area, resources of your clientele, and your own business plan. I adapted mine from what I googled online and what I receive from my MDs and allied Med when I seek services in my area.

> **Response 2:** There may be one in the “files” section of this page.

Anybody have a cancellation fee/policy? 

Most of my clients are very respectful of my time, however I currently have 2 that take advantage of me being “laid back”. 
How can I go about implementing this new policy with existing clients? What should I charge? 
Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My policy is if I can fill it, I don’t charge. If I can’t, I bill them. My intake form clearly states late cancellation will be billed, I let them know when calling to cancel that if I can fill it I won’t charge, but at the last minute it may not be possible. As I only see 4 a day it’s a 25% hit to my income and I share that info with them.

> **Response 2:** Depends on how far in advance they cancel.  Full cost of session if working a few hours. 50% if same day

Does your intake paperwork and consent form have a canceled policy

HR question! Hiring my first employee and looking to do it right. Didn't find anybody in my first round of interviews. Provided a boilerplate follow-up email stating we had elected not to pursue next steps with each candidate. One reached back and asked for specific reasons. In all honesty I only gave that person a courtesy interview since we've worked together in the past. I didn't hire them because since they graduated in 2017 they haven't stayed with any employer greater than 13 months, usually leaving for a new position between 6-9 months after hire. They've only been with their current employer 10 months. I'd like to provide them that honest feedback, but need help translating into HR-speak. Any suggestions?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Did you ask why they haven’t stayed with any employer?

> **Response 2:** Have AI help you ;) type up a draft, copy it over to the aI generator,  see what pops up. Seems like you already know why: our company is looking for long term employment commitment abilities.We didn't feel you're a prime candidate for us.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** You have no obligations to an independent contractor...work comp ins, benefits, taxes. However, for PRN, everything applies except for benefits. I am a PRN at a place and, with the exception of benefits, the employer is responsible for all of the above.

Does anyone have experience with functional activity screens that one does for companies when they want to hire a new employee? If so have you ever heard of a certification process? Please note I am not referencing a functional capacity test. For example can they climb a ladder, or lift a box...
Main concerns... "scope of practice"???

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used to do them. Some places (I believe American energy/gas or something) requires you be “certified”. Basically read their manual and sign off you’ve done it. Most places (hospitals, schools) have a template to work off of and they’re pretty quick! No real training as it’s like ROM, MMT, some functional lifting, carrying etc

> **Response 2:** I thought it was just something my office did, but when I merged with The Big Boys, they had a line item in their budget that includes post offer testing

Florida. A Medicare patient wants to be seen by PTA for non covered, not skilled interventions (help with HEP)/ cash pay services at home. ABN will be signed. Does anything else  ( Rx from MD, some type of eval)need to be done?  Is supervision of PTA by PT required for non covered services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Check your state rules and regs for supervision if PRA uses credentials

> **Response 2:** Still need to abide by state practice laws

For those who are mobile who started out part time building their caseload before leaving another job or just only want to be part time. How did you handle when clients had conflicts with the days you were going to be working (doctor's appointments, family commitment, personal matters, etc) and you were having trouble meeting frequency for the plan of care? I do have some Med B clients, at what point would you be concerned if you were to be audited that frequency wasn't consistently being met even if you're documenting the missed visit notes.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is the first time I am really struggling with scheduling. I am now being honest with folks about my availability before we schedule the eval. They can decide if that time works for them or if they need to look elsewhere for therapy.

> **Response 2:** Be further ight at the very beginning with your hours and make sure that your standard days work for them, and then if they need to miss those days in the cancellation notes detail why the patient missed those days. As long as your education and documentation is in order then audit concerns go away. ￼

Hello everyone, new to treating independently. After seeing a patient, having them sign their consent forms, and documenting the visit, how would I go about saving these in a HIPAA-compliant manner? 
Are there any scheduling apps you'd recommend that integrate this feature and have their own EMR?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** you can save them in a google drive that has a BAA signed or you can use a larger practice management system to streamline this. My practice uses Jane for documentation and billing and GHL for practice management, communication, and administration. Jane offers an introductory deal if you mention Uncaged and if you're interested in GHL Uncaged offers this and saves you a ton of money.

> **Response 2:** I want to second Jane. If you plan on growing, it is a great all-in-one platform.

**Community Responses:**

iPad with Magic Keyboard at gyms and for most evals when mobile
iPad for virtual appointments and meetings
iPhone for follow up visits and some evals when mobile

I do use an old MacBook Pro at home for admin. But I can do everything from my iPad and iPhone.

> **Response 2:** I love my iPad with Magic Keyboard but you can get an M1 MacBook Air for cheaper at Walmart. That’s probably your best bet because of longevity

Favorite platform for e-newsletter, for a solopreneur new business?
Priorities: ease of use/user-friendly, affordable
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For ease of use, I would say mailchimp is pretty cut and dry, and its free to start. The Uncaged Clinicians are big fans of GoHighLevel because it has so many arms to use all in one, which it does so I would check that platform out as well. I currently use Active Campaign for all my email needs, but its a bit more complicated to run than something like mailchimp. consider that if you have only a few emails, gmail works just fine, is free and you can just BCC everyone so you arent sharing emails with them

> **Response 2:** I have been happy with Mailerlite.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am also interested if anyone has used Google Appointments for scheduling.

> **Response 2:** I used Google Calendar when I first started out, but I was concerned with the HIPAA component (like if I was having clients book their own apts on my calendar, it’s open to whoever has access to the calendar). Sure I could come up with some code or privacy system but that seemed annoying. I just scheduled everything on my end using initials. Never used stripe, but I really liked IvyPay before I upgraded to Jane EMR

Hi everyone. I received a pre-payment review for 3 dates of service on a patient from Medicare (Pt has Railroad Medicare). Has anyone ever had to do one of these? I keep detailed visit notes, but they want all except for the blood of my first born child 🙄. Do you suggest I type something up on word that addresses all of these requirements along with my treatment note so the auditor can read it more easily? Any suggestions are welcome! Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, I just went through this and passed/ was paid in full. I provided what they requested (which ultimately was only eval, signed plan of care, daily notes, and progress update as my documentation was adequate to demonstrate medical necessity). I did not send anything extra!

> **Response 2:** #Compliance #RailroadMedicare Palmetto, the MAC for RR Medicare has initiated a series of "Targeted Probe & Educate" reviews (audits) involving outpatient therapy. 

Suggest reviewing letter very carefully to gather all the items required, and address every item in the documentation request. Palmetto provided education on TPE response in a recent presentation. 

Reach out if you need further information or clarification.

**Original Post:**
Hello! I’m seeking advice regarding staffing and feedback. 
I’ve been uncaged for 4 years. I am to the point I can afford a tech nearly 30-40 hours a week. I’ve hired a tech who does an amazing job. He’s been with me for 9 months. He’s young, early 20s, has some technical school background, training for EMT. I do wound care. He assists w/patient care, scribing, ordering/stocking, cleaning, anything else needed. He’s very flexible and easy going. Very thorough and good at his job. After months of training, he is very familiar with our process, rarely needs corrected with work. Early on I had to correct him about professionalism (chewing tobacco and eating in front of patients), and he responded immediately and we haven’t had another issue. He has underlying anxiety (goes to counseling) so im careful giving feedback, but overall, he’s great!  About two weeks ago, I told him he didnt needed to stay late, but he chose to, then politely left mid treatment. Later he sent a text apologizing, saying he needed a break, he was getting burned out. We had 3 crazy evals that day, and when the pt dumped the colostomy bag, he was over it. Rightfully so. We also had 9 more evals than average that month (75% increase). It’s just the two of us. No front desk, so he was doing that too. A front desk person started this week. 

My issue is he has a habit of picking at his face. He will pick the scabs, look at them and flick them or throw them down. It’s all day. I am a freak about being clean, especially given what we do. He’s in every treatment w/me. About a month ago, he flicked it toward my treatment table (not on it) and I immediately addressed it after the treatment. I explained it would be good if he didn’t pick at his face as much and I explained my concern regarding the event that happened. He was apologetic and surprised when I pointed out his scab was directed at my treatment table, unintentionally of course. Unlike all of our other professionalism talks, not much changed except he doesnt flick them anymore. This week, as I was teaching him on my computer, he dropped a scab on my keyboard. He brushed it away. I was so upset by this, I didn’t say anything (which was best w/my personality). 

I feel I need to address this. My family doesn’t do this, so I dont really understand it. Im trying to decide how to approach this for the second time, assuming I should. I do not want to upset him. He does so much for our clinic. I’m concerned it’s a nervous habit and he’s going to have a hard time stopping. If I’m over reacting, I’m open to hear feedback. I know everyone is different. Maybe other people are like this and I don’t notice b/c Im not with them all day. Regardless, the feedback here has always been helpful. I’m open to all thoughts, opinions, and/or what you would do. Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is he aware that he’s doing it or is it subconscious? I’d approach more with curiosity and a goal of helping him as this is a habit that would likely not be acceptable in most work places. Is he picking when he’s anxious? Overwhelmed? When he’s processing a lot of information? If the driving force behind the picking can be parsed out, it may be possible to reshape or replace the behavior.

> **Response 2:** One of my patients was diagnosed with this which was the first time I had ever heard of it. Dermatillomania

Im losing interest managing an OT clinic wjere i can be nearly 100% remote  Not feeling like I want to give up the flexibility of being “in charge” and pick up a full caseload to make the same amount of money as an employee. Not wanting to open a clinic and have the owner stress consistently. Not able to find the right hyper focus side hustle  

🫠 I’m trying to remind myself this is a GOOD problem but my adhd brain is bored. 

Any advice or suggestions? I’m losing steam.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why not see some patients at said clinic, mixed into your management role.  I was in management for almost 10 years, and having about 20% patient care responsibilities kept me (mostly) sane.  Besides, it keeps the skills fresh and the conversations with staff relevant.

> **Response 2:** I’ve been there, a few times, I took the challenge route.  Could you take some challenging CE courses to learn a new skillset?

Has anyone hired a company to work on their SEO or marketing?  Did you have to do a 1099 for their business?  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s very possible you can 1099 them, and should if you can so that way you don’t have to pay employee taxes. But ask your tax preparer first! I wanted to 1099 my PRN providers but I was told I definitely could not in my state and have to W2 them.

> **Response 2:** I do SEO and if you pay thru a cc processor you do not need to do a 1099, as that income is reported by the processor. If they are a corporation you never need to. If LLC, partnership, or sole proprietor then you might if you paid via check, transfer, or cash and total was over $600. I'd dbl check with your accountant to be 100% sure.

Hi everyone! Can I hire a PTA as an independent contractor for my mostly med B mobile practice in NJ ? I am a PT and will be available on call or video call as needed. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Absolutely 💯 you do the evaluation and then you have your PTA work with them. Those are the rules in NJ where you longer have to be on sit and just be reachable by phone. 👍

> **Response 2:** As of right now under the PHE, you can provide virtual supervision for PTAs.   As for hiring them as a 1099/IC, check federal and your state regulations on 1099; there are specific requirements that must be met to qualify as a 1099/IC.

Looking for a job, preferably from home, that has a steeper financial climb with an OT degree. 

I.e Possibly quality control 

Bonus if u know companies that offer andor hiring

**Community Responses:**

OT looking at EHRs/EMRs: I am considering Healthie, Carepatron, or Embark. Any recommendations/experiences?  I think I will stay side-gig style for a while, so the 10 active patients free with Healthie looks good, and someone said it's easy to switch to another EMR since with 11+ pts it costs significantly more than the others. I am not planning to do telehealth. 

I am planning to use Google Workspace for my email address.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Healthie feedback:  We have used Healthie for the last 5 years in our PT mobile concierge practice and has worked well for us.  My wife and I are both PTs, with a focus on pediatrics for my wife and sports/ortho for myself.  Healthie allows us to create programs as well to host educational content for clients either for free or additional revenue streams.  The intake process is very streamlined once set up, as well as billing, invoicing, superbills, etc..  As with many EMR systems, they all seem to have idiosyncrasies that could be better at times.  Overall solid for us.

> **Response 2:** What type practice- it depends on many things- insurance? Cash? Peds? Adults?  I’ve never heard of Healthie or Carepateon- better add those to our list to check out.

Topic- cancellation policy.

I’m curious others who have a cash business and their cancellation policy.(full disclosure, I am new to the business side of PT) what do people do when patients cancel bc they are sick and cx day of? Still hold them to the policy, or try to accommodate them?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Case by case basis.  

In the past month I’ve more same day (less than 24 hour) cancels than I’ve had in the past 3 years combined. Flu A and B are both rampant around where I live and I don’t want people coming in sick so I haven’t been charging for them. 

My clients know if they cancel I probably can’t get them in again for a month so they’re usually really good about coming in. 

My policy is:
•less than 24 hours notice = 50% of the appointment cost
•less than 4 hours notice or no notice =100% of the appointment cost (this one I always charge, has to be a very significant situation for me to waive)

> **Response 2:** Sickness and family emergencies are given grace. Otherwise 1 warning then charge. Ours is $50

Question for clinics with more than one clinician…
How do you handle phone calls to schedule patients? Currently i use Google voice which sends it to my phone but in January I am adding two more clinicians, an office manager and a temporary brick and mortar rental space until we can build our own clinic. My office manager will only work one day a week remotely. I currently use Jane app and some patients schedule directly online, but I still need to talk to patients who have questions or contact doctor offices.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We utilize a CRM

> **Response 2:** We use iplum then also a virtual assistant. Call one of our clinics. 731-215-0919. Congratulations!!!

This may be a dumb question but how does documentation work if you’re cash based? Do you keep a brief summary of your visit for your own records?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a professional, you NEED to document for you and the patients’ benefit. You just don’t need to follow those ridiculous arbitrary payer requirements to a “t”.  But a basic SOAP format is golden.

> **Response 2:** You can pay for a documentation software or do your own thing. I personally use Google suite to keep everything organized, save templates, etc.  Its inexpensive and has basic functionality to get you started.

For clients that are traveling from out of state to see you, what is your intake process? 

I know we have to be licensed in the state we see clients, but with a virtual session…. am I allowed to screen and do a mini-eval to make sure they’re a candidate before they travel? 

Cash based services for week - long intensives with PT/OT.

Thank you!

*missouri

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You have to follow your state regulations so if you can’t treat across state lines, your can’t virtually eval across state lines. A conversation to screen if they would be appropriate to travel to you for an eval would be ok though

> **Response 2:** Screen-yes. Mini eval-NO.
 State licensure laws apply to everyone--regardless of practice set up.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do! It's not ideal, but I'm making it work. Would love to hear how other people are using it. I use the membership feature for monthly autopay. Then I just sign them up and mark as arrived myself since I'm currently only twice a week and everyone has an "assigned" class time.

> **Response 2:** I do. I added a group class and the number of participants is limited. They can all sign up online and I check them in when they come. Once checked in it adds a balance to their acct and they can either pay it or put a card on file for me to bill

Hi! My website is made on Wix and I’d like to add some sort of lead gen (like an e book or info sheet) that can be emailed automatically when it is clicked on. Is this possible on Wix ?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wix can tech do it but I'd recommend integrating another service to do automations like that. You'll need an email service if you don't have one. Mailer lite is my first rec for a free option with automation. Convertkit is my top pick, but no free option. Those services can fully integrate with wix, have sign up forms, and will deliver your lead magnet/freebie.

> **Response 2:** Hi Tara Galgano Phaff Absolutely! On Wix, you can integrate a lead generation form using Wix Forms. Simply create a form for users to fill out, and then set up an automated email response with the e-book or info sheet attached. Wix offers various features to help you achieve this seamlessly. If you need more guidance, feel free to ask!

Hellonote users- When you are doing a re-certification and are planning to bill a re-eval do you use the "re=certification" note type and just bill part of it as a re-eval;  or do you use the "re-evaluation" note type?? Thanks in advance! Cross posted.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey friend! So if you are doing a re-cert to extend the plan of care past the original expiration date (because I'm assuming they are making progress), then you do not bill for a re-evaluation. You can bill for ther act or self care or whatever you think the session would fall under. A re-eval should only be billed if you are re-doing the whole plan of care because there has been a significant change in status, such as a new diagnosis or a hospitalization for something. Re-eval charges are hardly ever billed. Hope that makes sense!

> **Response 2:** I've always done recertification note then billed for whatever I did. I guess depends why you're doing a re-eval. But the recert should work. Idk what the re-eval note type looks like as I've never used it

Hi- I live in a big city where parking is a headache and I don’t want to be lugging a portable table around to do mobile sessions. So thinking a brick and mortar would be best starting point for me. I am single so don’t have the $ cushion or overhead. Wanting insights on if taking out a business loan is worth it, how long it took you to pay it off, if you regret it/ would do differently if you had to do it over? If anyone is open to sharing…Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you NEED a table? I do mobile and honestly feel like as someone who is not a heavy manual therapist that I get by fine without. 
This has freed me up a bit and I can bring basically a bag to visits with bands, sometimes some weights. Many people have home gym equipment since the pandemic to so that helps.
I also started in City and honestly could bike between some appointments!

Can or does any company use a physical therapy assistant license in the state they are working in to be the thing that watches and communicates live. It is remote, it is therapeutic and it is monitoring. It’s just not an app. It would be some telehealth platform. ￼￼￼￼ if so this could be a great alternative health career for a PTA or COTA￼.

Help me understand something!
I have 8 1099's who are treated as such. I am bringing on a W2. I know this means I need to get WC insurance (in Maryland) but I'm confused on the need for group malpractice. My 1099s each have their own malpractice and general liability, and I also have my own. My practice is "additional insured" on each policy. 

Can the W2 get his own and then I reimburse him as "accountable plan" to avoid him being taxed on the reimbursement?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No.  W2 all need to be under your policy.  Even if they had their own private policy. That would not legally excuse you from having them under yours.  

Curious why everyone else a 1099 and then take on a W2?

I have someone that is interested in doing nutrition coaching/weight loss journey with people (ARNP). Was wondering if there would be any value in trying to bring her in as an independent contractor and if that would benefit me or complicate matters. She may not be interested, but i'm wanting to make sure i don't miss an opportunity since she is lovely and when lovely people come around that people also love, i try to pay attention! What could that look like? Or should i focus and stop the squirrel brain.

I recently started a mobile OP practice. Right now it’s just me but I have always planned to add additional therapists later on. I will be going on maternity leave for 3-4 months in late January or early February. Short term disability that covered maternity leave was not an option for me as an individual. I do of course want to spend time bonding with my baby and healing but some income would be nice too. Other solo practitioner moms who have done this: did you hire a PRN or FT/PT employee to cover your maternity leave? If so, how did you as the business owner handle chasing down referrals, POC and recert signatures, insurance payments, etc.?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Would love to see the feedback on this as I’m due in December. I feel like I was just starting to gain some traction with my practice and now I’m afraid to take on patients that I might not be able to see through their entire episode of care

> **Response 2:** i just did this. my babe is 3 months. i opted not to hire anyone/have anyone cover. i was down to about 6 patients the week of my due date. they were all incredibly understanding. i lost a couple patients that i had hoped to pick back up when i returned (slowly) at 9 weeks post partum. but it's ok. i'm building back up.

**Original Post:**
Hey all!

Looking for some advice/creative solutions. 
I left my job in March to pursue my own practice/escape the burnout and get my life in order. I am primarily doing cash concierge ortho/personal training but, I do have a small location that I can practice out of.  A few things happened at the beginning that have made this current venture not sustainable or, not headed in the direction of the dream, without serious overhaul. 

My mentor/past professor is opening up a clinic inside a brand new fighter’s gym and would like me to run it. Initially I would be the only PT but as we expand I will move into the clinical director role. I don’t have specifics yet but this is someone I trust who is building a package for me to make me an offer “too good to refuse” (high salary, benefits, revenue sharing) 

Since working for myself I have noticed that the “perk” I value the most is the freedom/flexibility of schedule. It has allowed me to stay on top of my personal appointments, manage the home, take better care of my dog and enjoy life. Going back to a 9-5 (probably more with the admin side) is where I will have the most trouble adjusting… Looking for creative options/perks/benefits that I could suggest in order to make the work life balance more balanced! I’m willing to compromise on pay or other benefits if it enables a more “free” life. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or ideas!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would ask what the goal metrics are and what the professor is bringing to the table...do they already have referral sources ready to give you patients? How busy will you need to be in order to have all the great perks/pay? Ask how many visits that person is expecting you to see/when would another clinician be brought on? Once you know numbers, you'll know how busy each day you'll end up being and then you can see how the work life balance will be.

Side thought, if you already have your own business but struggling with getting it going, why not partner with this person instead of being an employee?? Or contract with this person? Once you are an employee, your control of your day is gone.

> **Response 2:** Bargain in control? 1-2 set admin days where you don't treat and can be work from home? Schedule your MD visits a few weeks in advance,and just be allowed to move your schedule around to accommodate? May be harder at the beginning when it's just you. Not easy necessarily but if that's what matters to you, then find a way to make it work

**Community Responses:**

I am so glad after 54 years to be done..because you are all dealing with a bunch of BS that had nothing to do with getting people better

For clinics trying to make scheduling easier for patients has anyone here linked their EMR with tools like ZocDoc or similar? Did it actually bring in more patients or just more no-shows?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Our EMR has an online scheduling portal that we've linked to all of our social media. Patients can pick a time that works for them, complete their intake, upload insurance and script and just show up at the time of service. We currently use Spry. They also send text and email reminders to the patient. We've actually seen a decrease in no-shows since switching to Spry.

> **Response 2:** Had ZocDoc for 5 months. Zero leads. It is free. And I could do more of an in depth setup but we have been busy as it is

When transitioning a patient from PT to wellness do you document an initial assessment on day one of wellness? Patients direct access has expired and he still want to work of strength and endurance to prevent reoccurrence of LBP. Please let me know what your protocol is and what documentation you do. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I indicate in the last PT note that the patient will be transitioning to wellness with an explanation as to why. For wellness documentation is minimum. List exercises and any pertinent info. No true need objective tests/measures or a PT assessment.

Also, wellness does not qualify for insurance reimbursement. 

I have a separate set of paperwork that the patient completes indicating that they understand they will be participating in wellness and that it is not eligible for a superbill because it does not qualify for reimbursement.

Has anyone done screenings for or seen patients together with a doctor, dentist, or other provider?

I’m wondering about logistics around documentation? Would you still have patients sign all your typical consents and write a full report? If you’re doing more of just a screening, is this necessary?  They will already be signing consents and release and intake forms for the provider. 

Would love to hear how others have navigated this!

Outpatient clinicians: do you dc all your patients on your last day at the clinic before other therapist starts treating patients ? Please advise. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always completed a note that transferred care over to the next therapist. I just copied and pasted the same little sentence transferring care and then signed each note

> **Response 2:** Last time I left an outpatient company the latest progress note or update we just typed that the remainder of POC was transferred to (enter new persons name) and expected date of transfer.

The current outpatient clinic I work at does not do any of that but doesn’t keep up to date with joint commission and other regulatory agencies.

Sharing a shining example of how to hand off a discussion with a client lead to another member of your team: 

"Only thing I will deal with is the pricing and payment.  He will cover everything else for you😊.  He's real good at what he does.  I trust him completely in my absence"

Had this sent to me from the wedding DJ I'd been primarily communicating with. He turned me over to his colleague, and I was seriously encouraged by how he did it.

Made me confident that this wasn't some new person on the team he didn't trust to do the job alone yet.

Could logic have led me to that same conclusion if he hadn't expressed his full confidence in this individual? Maybe. 

But when the person on the other end places high importance on the decision, there's a lot of emotion involved, too. Don't bet their trust in you.

Hello all! I need some help with my very first workshop. I never been to one myself so really I have nothing to go off. I have searched youtube for some examples but they all seem boring... So I am hoping for some good tips and examples.

Do you have any good resources to use? What worked in your case?

Workshop will be on knee pain. Population: active adults. I plan to briefly go over anatomy. Reasons why we have knee pain and do little deeper dive into muscular reasons. Weak quad, weak hips etc...

For "challenge" I plan to ask the group to do SL squat, SL stance (to check ankle stability) and standing quad stretch (heel to butt chick).  Any other/better suggestions?

Lastly, I plan to tech group few exercises to make sure they have strong hips and knees.
-tke with TB (can be combined in squat)
- hip abd like fire hydrants
- sit to stand (BLE, and ULE for stronger folks)
- bridges (BLE, and ULE for stronger)

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've done a ton of workshops. We go over anatomy, common causes and try and find someone we think may do well with a 5-minute treatment miracle. Keep it simple, easy terms, give practical things they can go home with. Happy to chat. DM me

> **Response 2:** Check out MMOA.  Modern Management of the Older Adult.  The have very good resources for several  workshops!

How would one go about bringing on a 1099 employee. And how do you know if you need a 1099 vs full time?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1099s are useful for short duration coverage such as vacation and other types of leave. If you begin to give them their own caseload you will want to W2 them. They do not need to be full time to be a W2 employee. It’s slightly more money up front but you are protecting your investment on the back end. It is illegal to make a 1099 sign a non compete. This means they could open a practice while working for you, it is actually expected they do this. They cannot take your clients but they can take any referrals of your clients.

> **Response 2:** If you have a small business development center in your area they are an excellent source to get information about contract vs employee.

Thinking about resolutions and goals for 2026 - and curious to hear about what other people do! Hopefully this will give some inspiration not just me but whoever needs it! 

How do you organize your to do list and your calendars? Electronically, pen/paper, on your EMR or a planner, combine work and personal lists/calendar, keep things separate? I’ve tried out a few combos and just want to be consistent going into the New Year

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I spent a lot of time integrating my Google workspace with my calendars, tasks, email etc. 

The thing that probably helped me the most was reading the book “Traction” by Gino Wickman and using that framework along with the associated EOSone software (which is free).

> **Response 2:** I bought a skylight this year to try out but I’m normally a paper planner person. I put everything on my EMR even personal appts and such to keep track bc that’s my main calendar so i only have to track one

For Outpatient Clinic owners accepting insurance who use PROMPT software. Can you please give me the good, the bad and THE UGLY please? Is it worth the high price tag?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I found the learning curve steep. 6 months in now. Still learning new things every week. Lots of good general support from the team though to create systems for growth. Lots of features. I’m one PT only so far with office manager.

> **Response 2:** No real “ugly” IMO but I will say it is very expensive compared to other EMRs I’ve personally used. I’ve used dozens of EMRs at this point and I’ll say some of the other EMRs have most of the same features of Prompt but at a cheaper price point.

My free ride on Healthie EMR has come to an end and it's time to start paying a monthly fee. I was considering Jane when I first started, but then the free Healthie account with limited clients was working well so I never switched. I now have to make a decision, stay with Healthie and pay the $60 a month for an account plus a fax line or switch to Jane (or other EMR). Does anyone have any insight to help me make a decision? The pricing seems similar, but what about the functionality of it in your day to day practice? 

For reference I really enjoy the text reminders, phone app, ease of billing, and fax ability of Healthie. I would love to have a program that is tailored to my hand therapy practice with standardized forms, but I've made do so far.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Check out spry. No onboarding fees, great system at a great price. It’s been a fantastic addition to my clinic

Hello fellow uncaged clinicians!
I’ve seen quite a few posts lately of therapists discussed AI and scribe options in therapy world and for employees to be more efficient with documentation etc. 
I just thought I’ll share my incredible and absolutely amazing experience with the AI software called NOKI. Our clinic has been using Noki for many months now and it is absolutely fantastic! It has helped us so much with significant reduction in documentation time. We’ve been particularly impressed with it’s CDSS feauture plus doctor’s letter, plan of care summary letter, referral letter, templates and a few more. 
If any of you are looking to get AI into their clinic, they must really consider Noki AI. I’m happy to make an introduction between the clinic/clinician and the Noki team rep. 

😊 thank you!!

For those that use Jane:
I’d love to have the option to make a grid with date of session on top and on the left side have a list of manual therapy, exercises, education, etc so I can easily visually see the progression over time. Jane doesn’t create grids as such. Anyone come up with something similar to organize the note for efficiency and easy visual of interventions? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following this because I’d love the same! Many people have requested the feature to be able to add a table to the notes but unfortunately not every requested feature gets added.

> **Response 2:** For the current note, I duplicate it from the last note and then put put the new updated at the top. I.e

S:
3/14: back is flared up blah blah
3/7 doing well, blah blah 

O: 
3/14: + FADIR, blah blah
Treatment: xyz

3/7: + FADIR blah blah
Treatment: xyz

It requires a little scrolling but it’s a nice way to quickly see what I did last time. So for some clients who I’ve seen forever, the notes are LONG as I basically kind of keep adding to the previous one

Have a few questions and would love for those of you with mobile experience to have input please. Trying to calculate costs from therapists perspective of doing mobile PT. They would have a company computer for documentation. In addition to costs associated with a vehicle, fuel, insurance, unpaid travel time, cell phone, cell phone and internet service, malpractice, liability insurance, bookkeeping what other monthly costs would be incurred? Feel like I am missing a few important items. What is general practice as far as patient treatment and home program supplies and equipment? Does the company supply? Bill patient? Or. does therapist supply and pay for what they need? Also is there a general % range difference in pay between PRN pay and salary position. As PRN the company has expensses but has scheduling flexibility and does not have to pay for benefits, time off, etc. Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am in North Texas.  There are Tolls, plus at times, I have had some of these expenses 
EHR
Coach, 
Programs, classes, courses in person or online for starting a business
Books, audiobooks, education
Specialty certifications 
Coffee (when needed and spent using facilities)
Food while on the go 
Bookkeeper->software (Quickbooks,etc)
Tax prep goes up
Scribe maybe
Client-customer management system (HIPAA compliant text-)
Google suite
Website landing page
Expo vendor booth fees
Advertising/ marketing material
The list goes on……

> **Response 2:** Get a coach, that's a solid investment for some people wanting to start out. Good ROI

Curious
So I work under my business for a 1099 and then separately on my own business. Two patients from the 1099 (who weren’t on my caseload, I just did a one time visit with them before they left for the next two months) contacted me and wanted to work with me outside the 1099 since they didn’t like it or were confused with the tech people there. I bill medicare B on my insurance and they would be eligible under a kx modifier, but I’m not sure if this counts as like - stealing patients? They contacted me independently and I assume they have the right to choose their provider & I’m not taking any more patients from the 1099 since my caseload is increasing on my own company.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What are the terms of your Employment Agreement for the 1099?

> **Response 2:** If the company loses revenue they had coming in due to you taking the patient they can sue you. I know someone who had a patient ask to go with them and got sued.

I’m an OT in a school setting and am contracted for 190 days a year. I’m openning a private OT practice. My contract states, “The employee agrees not to engage in any business activity that directly competes with or solicits business away from the core services provided by the AEA during the term of this agreement.”  The AEA (my employer) does not provide outpatient OT services. Is it that simple or should I be worried? Do I need to do anything to cover myself? Please help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It should be fine as long as you don’t let any of the parents know that you offer outpatient services. That could be seen as ethical using one job to drum up business for the other.

> **Response 2:** If they don't offer outpatient OT services and then you DO offer outpatient OT services, that seems as simple as can be. But don't take my word for it. I was literally fired on those grounds a few years ago 🤣

This may not apply depending on your setup, but my first jobs were in chaos. Discuss stress/load management. Make sure they are happy and not taking a bunch of work or stress home. If your employee is happy at work, and has good work/life balance, they will stick around and continue to work hard. 
If they aren’t meeting certain expectations, I would discuss that after asking how they are doing.

Not strictly in line with this groups motive, but I was hoping to get some feedback! I am set to potentially move up within my company’s structure from assistant director to director as our current director/regional partner is moving to a different clinic. I’m meeting with the president and CEO this week. 

How might you advise structuring this conversation? I don’t want to outright ask for the silver spoon/raise but I don’t want to be told to “earn it/prove it” without any objective goals/benchmarks or timelines to achieve. Advice?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How many staff will you be over? Not sure the size of you company but if it’s over multiple clinics and 20+ clinicians then it’s likely you are competing against other managers and external candidates. Seek to solve their problems and show how you have delivered in the past. If it’s just a clinic manager role then yeah you likely have no competition or minimal competition. People move states for regional jobs at big companies

> **Response 2:** Ask about the KPIs going to director. You're equally wondering if it's a good fit for you/your life as they will equally need to fill the role. With a title change like that and added/changed responsibilities there is an expectation of a raise. If the raise or lack thereof (if I'm reading your post right) doesn't align to the increased load it should be a no for you and they will now be required to hire, train, move someone (takes time and money). 

You are in a great position here (not them) remember that.

Any tips on when to start the process of hiring a second physical therapist? Last fall I started from scratch (some weeks with 0 appointments), currently I’m at 40% capacity.  I’m thinking, when the time comes, first I’ll hire someone who is an admin (likely ~20 hours/ week) and then look for a second PT.  I know hiring isn’t super speedy always, so it’s bad to wait until last minute.  Just curious about what metric people use to know it’s time to hire (rather than waiting until it’s too slammed to train someone).
Thanks for any thoughts/ advice!

Note: I was thinking when my schedule is 75% full that’s probably when I should start looking to hire?

For those who are mobile with team members? How do you foster a sense of belonging and collaboration? 
We have team and education meetings, outings etc., but it’s not the same when people get to see each other everyday in the clinic and build friendships as well as having meaningful conversations about treatment ideas.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We are nearly 100% a virtual team (2 engineers go in office…) and we utilize a few techniques to foster close working relationships. 1) Slack as a communication tool for quick questions, comments, funny moments in your day, etc. You can have separate channels for “funny things people said”, “learning moments” or “clinical questions” etc. 2) You can offer an open weekly or bi-weekly “office hours” on Zoom where the leadership/manager is available on Zoom, say from 4-5pm while therapists are documenting. Everyone can be working on their tasks but it’s nice to foster question/answer sessions or have a little conversation.

Can my front desk staff explain treatments to patients? Say a potential patient calls and asks what treatments we offer, is my front desk staff able to explain each treatment we offer? Such as dry needling, BFR, etc etc. Or legally they can't?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t see why that would be an issue they are just describing your services. We teach our admins to also do exactly that. 

However they should be trying to understand what is wrong with the patient and what their goals are. If they are just selling flashy treatments you will get price shopped by the clinic down the road doing it for cheaper.

> **Response 2:** So they should explain a disclaimer…  to the effect of each therapist will evaluate the patient individually and determine appropriate course of treatment. Various treatments that could be utilized include… and describe those potential treatments.

Any recommendations or opinions of advertising and providing PT services online to individuals not in your licensed state? Looking to start a virtual PT company and looking for some insight on that.

Could you still provide care to individuals not in your license state and have them sign a consent that it is not skilled care?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My opinion is as follows:

yes you can. The individual receiving care is briefed on the situation and the use of terminology and for the 5 years I’ve been doing this, Not one person has ever even hesitated about it or really even cared in the slightest. 

The individual recei

> **Response 2:** Online PT is a pretty gray area. CJ and I have been managing folks’ pain and injuries through strength training modifications virtually for a couple of years now, all across the world. We don’t have them sign anything to my knowledge. We provide coaching and management of their training and if they need modifications based on aches and pains that they have, we make them.

I'm in Maryland and transitioning a 1099 worker to a W2 employee. Completely unaware of compliance issues here and what needs to be done to make sure I'm covering all my bases.

I currently use squarepayroll and they do have a W2 option. Anyone familiar with this transition and what needs to be done to make sure I'm in compliance?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** they need to fill out w4, you will need to send in new hire for to State.  also, cover them for wc and MD unemployment, CAQH if you bill insurance.  also add them to disability/health ins./ set up 401k if you offer that.

> **Response 2:** WC IS required in MD.  by having them  fill  out the w4 and signi it, the new therapist is a w2 not 1099 employee.

I've had a Medicare question posed to me. In outpatient, for Medicare patients, per Medicare, does the supervising OT have to be in the building when the OTA is treating? Did that loosen for Covid and now will revert back for 2023?
I remember some weird supervision thing but I thought that was supervision of students treating Medicare patients.
(apologies, I may cross post in other groups )

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Supervision requirements are noted in IOM 100-02, Ch. 15, §230.2(c)  Go To The Source

"General supervision is required for OTAs in all settings except private practice (which requires direct supervision) unless state practice requirements are more stringent, in which case state or local requirements must be followed."

Supervision requirements have been relaxed during the PHE wherein direct supervision could be accomplished using real-time, interactive audio ...... [see further clarification on "how".  This variance on direct supervision is through the later of 12/31/2021 or end of year PHE ends.  If PHE ends this year, supervision would revert back to "in the office suite" for private practice. 

For Rehab Agency, CORF, hospitals, SNFs, and HHA, the supervision remains at "general" supervision.

Aside from PTEverywhere, are there any other programs like this people are using for physical therapy services? I'm mostly interested in the emr, scheduling and legal form stuff they offer. I'm working towards a mobile, cash based practice. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use PTEverywhere and it has everything I need and I added a fax line which has been handy, but it is pricey. Once I got the hang of things I felt like I could have used a cheaper platform, but uploading videos of myself explaining topics for lengthier education pieces or things I want them to view and videos of myself doing exercises is easy. I started when there was a promo where it started cheaper as you built a caseload so if you call and do a demo that could be an option. This is kind of quirky, but I actually picked it over Jane because I liked that PT was in the title and how that seemed professionally, but Jane probably uploads your logo like they do and it's not really an issue, just a preference over here. Once PTEverywhere got pricier, I was busier so it wasn't really an issue and I considered switching but that seemed like a hassle and not worth the reduced price.

> **Response 2:** I used PTeverywhere and liked it but it was expensive.  A lot of people like Jane.  I use Noterro because I can have my wife and I both as PTs for about 90/month.  Thee forms are great, the notes are a little quirky.   Customer support is good

Hey Uncaged gang, I wanted to spread the word of a mobile PT app I've been using.  A local guy developed it for me.

Schedules patients, can also link to your website for others to schedule themselves.

Text and call patients all from this App -- I cancelled iPlum/Voip.

Sends automated text reminders** - from your business cell #, not random 1800 #.  This has been the most helpful, reminding patients of their appointments.

It does everything except documentation, which I just use Voice Memo and copy/paste that into Google Doc.

Feel free to reach out to Jakin (sounds like Bacon) at info@rareformagency.com

The app has helped me stay organized, wanted to spread the word 👍

I am contemplating hiring a PT to provide coverage during my vacation. Should I classify them as a PRN employee or an independent contractor (1099)? What other factors should I consider in this decision?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe you're in CA...we can't hire 1099 due to Assembly Bill 5 (the Uber rule) unless it is a business to business. Probably a good time to network with another business in the area that you can pay a flat rate per session. Otherwise you could hire a PRN employee

> **Response 2:** If you are just hiring for your specific vacation period a 1099 might be appropriate. If you are going to use PRN for other times etc I would consider PRN employee.

Looking to sign with a home health company per diem in NW Ohio and they offered $85 a visit. Is that good? Should they reimburse for gas mileage while per diem and doing multiple patients per time? What else should I negotiate or ask? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in northeast Ohio and that rate sounds pretty good based on what I've heard. I like the points system better to weight visits bc while 85 is pretty solid for follow up visits, if you do many opens, it gets unreasonable pretty fast. Mileage compensation should be expected, and the IRS sets that rate. Another concern when you are per diem is if the company can actually keep you busy enough to create the salary you want.

> **Response 2:** Are you going to be an employee or working as a 1099 Independent Contractor?

Do you resubmit auth requests when payers ask for more documentation or just send what you already sent? Half the time I can't tell what they actually want.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends. We’ve done some peer to peer reviews and asked them “what exactly is it that you’re wanting?” The best part is that what they are wanting, we already have documented. 
Anymore I won’t fight with UHC - I’ve been telling patients they need to call and fighting for their healthcare. And change insurances.

> **Response 2:** We used to get stuck in that loop all the time. Sprypt's AI now manages the prior auth workflow for us.. it identifies missing pieces when payers ask for more info and preps the right documentation before resubmitting. That’s cut down our denials big time.

I have a few questions for those of you who have published a book:
1. Which platform did you use to write your book?
2. How did you publish it?
3. Did you use any marketing to promote it?
4. About how many copies have you sold?
5. (If allowed by the admin) could you share a link to your book?

Thank you! 🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m currently part of a co-author book project. 

We’re working with femPower publishers in Canada (lead author is Canadian, that’s why she chose them.) It will have a unique ISBN # so it can be sold in bookstores. I don’t think you get one if you self publish, but I could be wrong. 

You will 100% need to do marketing to sell a book. Pre launch, actual launch, events, etc. Books won’t sell themselves.

Greg Todd is currently launching a book, you could watch his IG page and see how he’s positioning it and promoting it. He can also help you write a book I believe. 

Generally, books won’t make a lot of money. Most business or thought leadership books are part of a marketing funnel for a coaching program or services. Books establish credibility and build trust. 

My book will be published by November, but you can preview the cover & hear the concept of it on my IG stories or the highlight. (Just search Krista Frahm agency) 

You can write solo, hire a ghostwriter, hire a book coach, or join a book writing program. 😉

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Switched to spry this year. Great system billing, documentation and scheduling with great support. Easily handles multiple locations and therapists and cheap enough to work great for solo practice too

> **Response 2:** Check out SpryPT - there is functionality which allows you to schedule based on location, etc. Easy to use, robust, overall a very good EMR, in my opinion. We've been with them for almost 2 years now.

**Original Post:**
Hi fellow PTs - I have a poll for you. I want to be clear, I am not selling anything, just asking for honest feedback:

As either a solo clinician or maybe even part of a small team, would there be any interest or profit to be made (in your opinion) if there was a web based platform that would allow you to:

Have 1 on 1 telehealth sessions (for reabsorbing cancels or even extending outreach) 

Access hundreds of HEP videos to provide to your patients AND potentially tie this into RTM billing

Utilize skeletal tracking for exercise based games (to boost patient engagement and active participation in their recovery)

Have AI provide a post session score based on patient performances relative to the exercise video they are mimicking (can be synchronous or asynchronous). Can compare scores session over session to assess progress.

Have AI generate SOAP note documentation based on each sessions’s events, ROM valued, and performances (all youd need to do is just proofread and edit If necessary)

If this were available as a monthly license, what would be a fair price point?

Any thoughts or concerns with such a product?

Thanks in advance for your feedback, everyone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Telehealth platform, cool, especially if it's HIPPA compliant and has forms and checklists I can easily go through to keep the visit itself compliant with my own state practice act. 

HEP videos, fine, but I'd only get interested if there's a way to upload my own (either from another site or my own video). Would be even more interested if RTM integration was confirmed. 

Exercise based games is the most advanced thing in the list here. That is the only thing that has genuinely stood out to me so far. 👍👍👍👍 Curious on equipment needed though.

Patient performance score relative to a video sounds like a terrible idea. There are so many ways to move, and not every human is built the same way. Asking them to chase a score for how well they match someone else sounds counterproductive to encouraging them to move their OWN body better.👎👎👎👎

AI generated SOAP note is great. Would be concerned about training the AI.

I'm not familiar with monthly license prices. Assuming that's like a subscription service, I'd expect to see something like this marketed at $200ish per month? Or per user? I really don't know. That price feels low, possibly. It would depend on how some of the features shake out.

How does everyone store EOB (paper copy) and intake (paper copy with wet signature) to follow HIPPA if you are mobile practice with home office as address? 

I upload intake to EMR but I am not if I still need wet signature copy for future reference. 

Is it ok to upload everything on your businesss google account which has signed BAA to have a cloud storage? If not, what are good options so I don’t have to hold on to paper copies of anything and I can shred them. 

Any advice is highly appreciated 🙏🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I put everything on google workspace in individual patient folders. If you have signed the BAA you are good to go! After i upload everything i shred the paperwork. I also have a lot of my intake automated with google forms to where patients/clients complete it through their email and it automatically gets emailed back to me

🗞 Have you read our most recent blog? 

Everything is built upon the Foundations!
Throughout the lifespan of the UNCAGED CLINICIAN blog, we have shared a wealth of knowledge designed to help the entrepreneur in his or her quest to becoming a successful business owner.

We have covered a wide range of topics to get the reader thinking of ways in which they may improve or make strides in all elements of being a business while avoiding a number of pitfalls.

In today's edition, we go old school in a way. Back to the basics.

More specifically, back to the Foundations.

We were recently asked by a loyal reader: "What exactly are the crucial foundations as defined by UNCAGED?"

Such a wonderful and important question!

After 5+ years of working with hundreds of clinicians, we have been able to identify the steps that so many skip over, resulting in a lot of frustrations down the road.

A recent blog talked about the importance of creating a solid foundation and not skipping steps.

What exactly are these Foundations?

**Original Post:**
I am a PT in Florida looking to do some cash based treatments at my CrossFit gym. I was wondering if I could get some insight into some basics of the legal components of how to do this, especially for dry needling.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yo answer question specifically For DN. They would need to sign a consent form prior. Make sure you sanitize the area and Carry a sharps container.

> **Response 2:** Check with your state practice act. I think some vary slightly but most require a signed informed consent prior to txt, certain amount of experience may be required, and I think some require screening the patient prior to txt. My attorney said she had a PT client lose her license because she didn’t screen prior to needling B UT and patient ended up with a pneumothorax. The state (not sure which state) took license away because no screen was performed despite documentation for proper needling technique and needle placement. My state doesn’t require a screen but I do a quick one anyway now. She advised good documentation of the signed informed consent, screening, for needles used/how many, muscles treated, and response to tx. 

Hope this helps!

I’m
Just starting out and I’m private pay I have a potential client who’s son is in school and she wants some therapy over the summer 
He only gets 30 minutes 1x week in school anybody do summer therapy and do an eval or just take the iep and go from there ? I would request the school report to view and see how long ago an assessment was done I typically don’t see anyone without - a new eval done by myself if their old eval is more than a year old 
Any insight ?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There’s nothing wrong with looking at their IEP, but in the school eval they’re limited in scope so not going to look at everything you can/should treat. 

Do your own eval and go from there. Maybe you’ll skip some outcome measures that shouldn’t be repeated at that time, but I wouldn’t go off of someone else’s assessment of the child when you have so many more things you can do.

TLDR: Don't forget to make sure you have DMARC, DKIM, and SPF setup on your domain DNS (where your URL is hosted). This not only applies for ppl using third parties to send newsletters, etc but also when using any branded email address. These are to prevent email spoofing and verify the senders are who they say they are. Those who don't have them can now encounter deliverability issues as of Feb 2024.

Here's a little bit about it from constant contact: https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/email-digital-marketing/articles/KnowledgeBase/7644-What-is-DMARC?lang=en_US

This first started as being for accounts who send 5000 emails per day, however most emails clients are now making it highly recommended or even required. You might see an alert popup up on logging in, don't ignore it.

If you don't add these, constant contact is just one that will change your sender address to one of theirs until you do. 

Here's what these things are in a nutshell:

Imagine you're at a costume party where everyone wears a mask, making it tough to tell who's who. This situation is a bit like the internet's email system: it's easy for someone to disguise themselves as someone else and send you emails pretending to be your bank, your friend, or your boss. That's where DMARC, DKIM, and SPF step in, acting as the party's bouncers, verifying the identity of each guest.

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is like a guest list at the party entrance. It checks if the sender's email server is on the list of approved servers for that domain. If the server isn't on the list, SPF tells the email system, "This one's trying to crash the party!" and can prevent the email from reaching your inbox.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is like a secret handshake. It uses a digital signature attached to the email, ensuring that the message really comes from where it says it does and hasn't been tampered with along the way. Think of it as checking if a guest knows the secret handshake before letting them mingle.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) watches over SPF and DKIM like a head bouncer. It uses the results from both to decide what to do with an email that fails the checks. DMARC can tell the email system to do nothing, quarantine the email, or reject it outright. It also sends reports back, saying who tried to get in, so the party planners can adjust their guest list and handshake as needed.

These three work together to make sure that the only emails reaching your inbox are from the people who they claim to be from, keeping the party crashers out and making the email world a safer place to communicate.

I'm a cash PT but I have a workman's comp patient I have accepted.

What notes am I required to fax and have signed by the physician? I assume eval, all progress notes and discharge.

Do they send them back signed? Or can I just get a verbal from them?

All new to this. Thank you in advance!

Hi All!

First time posting here-been following along quietly:) Been a cash-based pediatric therapy practice-giving our clients a superbill after payment.  Would love to help our clients and bill their OON benefit.  As a Mom myself, I understand that kids have needs  and cash flow issues can be real... We have Jane app as an EMR with a billing option.  I've watched workshops-including one on this chat. Searched online. And still quite clueless/overwhelmed  with the process. Any info/direction is much appreciated. Thank you!!!

Has anyone hired freelance admin assistants as a 1099 contractor?
I’m looking to hire someone in mind who I can train to help me with patient referrals. I would like to hire them as a 1099, but my BIL who’s a lawyer said “it could get sticky” and I’d be better off hiring as a W2 (we’re in California, so dealing with strict employment laws). If I can hire a freelancer, can it be hourly rate or would it better for a flat fee per “project?” Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in CA. 

ChatGPT the ABC rule.

Because my admin provides a "crucial role for my business" she can't be 1099'd. 

CA is a FAFO 😂 you can do it until they get disgruntled and rat you out to the state and then $$$$$in fines

Interesting, the first ever Doctorate of Athletic training program with Physical Therapist leading the program. 2 year program only. This program projects that DAT’s (Doctorate of Athetic Training ) will make the same amount as a PT. Everyone is infringing on everyone’s practice.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yup… Blurred lines isn’t doing any of us a favor. 

They still aren’t rehab professionals but I’m worried that with this kind of degree they will think they that they are. 
 
I work in professional sports and I’m washed out by ATCs. Sports teams not understanding why these injuries are happening in the first place nor how to properly rehab them. I mean it’s kind of great for me because people realize my work is so much different than what they are getting at facility. And the teams notice it too as I get referrals from the team medical staff. 

While I advocate for everyone to stay in their scope of practice this just highlights how we should be a multidisciplinary approach not one discipline doing all the therapies. That isn’t evidence based. We should be learning how to include us all on sports teams… including me, an occupational therapist. Arguably the first OT in the NFL.

If you follow this kind of stuff you’ll def be seeing me more. I’m a bulldog about it. Shaking things up a bit. I won’t be everyone’s favorite because of it but I’m ok with that. History wasn’t made by people being proper and polite.

Hi yall! I am looking to hire instructors to teach yoga and Pilates in my studio as an add on service. Any advice on how to structure pay or what to include in a contract? They would be 1099 employees. Do I need to add them to my insurance or require them to have their own?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Half of my practice is a yoga studio. All of my instructors are 1099s. We do a 60(then)/40 (me) split with a minimum payment per class. So, if they only have one person in class they don’t just make 60% of $12. 
I require them to each hold their own insurance. 

The main thing I have in my Independent contractor contract (aside from what services will be rendered for what pay) is that all yoga students are considered to belong to the studio/practice and if they provide yoga to them outside of the studio, that it’s grounds to terminate the contract.

Looking for guidance from any PTs in New York who have insight on opting in to paid family leave. I read you need to get disability as well. Who have you went through? Does the cost make it worth it? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just read up on this today. I’m currently on leave and was just curious what I could apply for. 

Self-employed peeps can opt in, even if they have no employees. We just have a waiting period of 2 years before we can be eligible for benefits. I used to have one for my admin and the premium depends on annual salary. I had it canceled because I didn’t think I’d need it. In hindsight, it would’ve made up for the worth of the premiums if I’m going to have to wait now anyway.

Hi Everyone! For anyone familiar with Florida regulations, does Florida require general or direct supervision of PTA's in Outpatient Mobile Therapy? I know Medicare does until the Proposed Rule change, but I'm thinking moreso for selfpay clients. The statues are very confusing in the way it's worded, and under what chapter PT in Private Practice falls under. Appreciate any insight - thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I work PRN for a company that does insurance based or self pay outpatient home therapy and I supervise PTAs working in the same county or surrounding just by cosigning for their notes so general is fine.  I believe the term is being in the same geographic area. I do evals and progress notes either via video call on doxy or by traveling to see the patient.

> **Response 2:** I believe it means that they are available at all times by phone / in general area . It allows PT to physically be in an alternate building

Looking for advice on hiring for a part time admin position for a mobile PT practice. We are in SC.

This positions typical job duties would include working remote, answering the phones, scheduling, verifying insurnace, and potentially assisting with billing. It’s going to be a very flexible position especially when it comes to what hours and days this person would like to work.

**Original Post:**
Hi everyone! We are currently hiring employees and are looking into professional malpractice and general liability insurance. I currently have an individual plan with CM&F and am happy with them but open to other options. 

My question is, what does everyone recommend in terms of type of insurance coverage for employees and multiple locations. Do you recommend having employees also get their own? Any other tips would be greatly appreciated as this definitely happened quicker than we thought!

Thanks 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have a broker who gives us different options/plans and each year we go over them and decide if we change or keep the same. We offer health insurance to all full time employees.

Trying to become licensed through AHCA in the state of Florida, one of the statutes says "At least two persons are on duty on the premises of the organization whenever a patient is being treated." I was planning on being a solo PT without receptionist help, at least until I become busy enough to need one. Are there ways to get around this? For example, my husband will be on the premises, working his own job, but can I just call him a receptionist without pay, or maybe a volunteer? I mean technically the plan is to have him there in case I have walk ins.

**Here at UNCAGED CLINICIAN, we are proud to be partners with JANEAPP.**

*Here is a helpful message from them on ways to reclaim your "Me Time"! *

*3 ways to reclaim your “me time”*
## Hey, UNCAGED!

Vas from the Jane team here. 👋

We know that as practitioners, your work day doesn’t always end after you leave the clinic.

When you’re in the business of caring for people, it’s not always easy to put your responsibilities aside to focus on “me time” — besides, sometimes the work-life balance swings more on the side of work. And that’s okay!

But as difficult as it may be, prioritizing this time for yourself is crucial for your own well-being *and* for the quality of care you provide.

Here are **3 strategies that can help you reclaim your “me time”** and weave self-care into your personal life:
## **#1: Set clear boundaries**

When the line between working hours and personal time becomes blurry, setting clear boundaries between the two is key.

Set specific start and end times for your workday, and make sure these times are clearly communicated to your patients or clients. Keeping your work laptop at the office and setting up automated after-hours email responses are great ways to build this habit.

You can also schedule personal activities just like you would a patient appointment — whether that’s an evening workout or a task on your to-do list. This not only ensures you have dedicated “me time”, but can also help keep you accountable to use it.

**#2: Evaluate what’s on your plate**

Take a long hard look at your daily workflow. Is there anything that can be streamlined, delegated, or simply dropped?

Often, we take on more tasks than we need to — feeling the pressure to complete those tasks ourselves. But recognize that there are tools and support systems for practitioners that can help reduce, or even eliminate, the workload of these tasks.

#3: Lean on your community

In a profession fueled by the act of giving, it can feel counterintuitive to receive. But in order to care for your patients, you need to first care for yourself.

Start building a reliable network — within your clinic, and beyond. Take advantage of a constantly connected online world by seeking out peer community groups and resources. Keep in mind that if you’re struggling with self-care, your fellow practitioners have likely experienced something similar, so don’t be afraid to reach out for advice.

When you start putting “me time” on your to-do list, you’ll notice the impact your own well-being has on the quality of care you provide.

To learn more about how Jane helps you take back time for yourself, head over to [Jane](https://meet.jane.app/more-time?utm_medium=uncaged_clinicians&utm_source=ambassador&utm_campaign=more_time_campaign&utm_content=email&utm_term=us_physio) to book a personalized demo.

**Original Post:**
I posted a while back about my progress on developing my own automation within Google Workspace as an EMR. 

I finally completed the automatic mileage tracker. Now I get an email with a Google Form link at the end of each day I see clients. After I fill out the Form it logs my miles for all clients and formats it into a Google Sheet for easy viewing and tracking. I’ll test this for the remainder of the year and then plan to implement it at the beginning of next year just to give ample time for troubleshooting. 

I started a project that will support the mileage tracker and make scheduling easier as well. I typically schedule people at set times on set days, so my schedule is consistent. So it will allow me to choose the client I am scheduling for, set the start day of the visits, set the days of the week they will occur, set the times for each specific day, and set the number of visits to schedule. Then it will add me and the client as attendees of the visit and set the location as their address, which will allow the mileage tracker to do its thing. I will also be adding a feature for scheduling evals that will allow me to create new contacts and schedule their eval at the same time. In addition, it will have a feature for creating vacation time. Vacation time will be set as “busy” and when visits are being scheduled using this app it will look for vacation time and schedule around it as blocked out time. 

The upfront time for developing these isn’t insignificant, but for a solo practitioner it is well worth it to save the money I do not using a traditional EMR.

Such a great tool;) I have been in this group for a while and should have make the leap sooner;) 

Thank you Hippo Scribe and Yansen Zhou for helping our profession get the job done in a manner that doesn’t take away from patient care! 

Just use the web browser but pretty easy! Also just used a Rode Microphone clipped to my shirt and once I started the note, I was able to treat hands free.  
I also use it exclusively on my phone.   Transfer to my EMR is just one more step via computer at end of day.  

I make my patients aware of what I am doing and once I get the subjective, I start my manual and I then talk about my plan for the session, interventions and exercises.  Within 5-10 mins of the patient arriving most of my note is completed and I can edit if the sessions doesn’t go according to plan or patient didn’t tolerate.

If we are doing a Wheelchair eval only for a Medicare patient, do we just do a regular eval and discharge? Then do a medical necessity letter? We've been doing WC eval for patients we see for a bit and decide they would benefit from a chair, but not just a wheelchair eval only.

**Community Responses:**

Hi y’all!

I am looking to find a more streamlined EMR system for the next school year. I currently run a private practice and have a variety of different software I use (SLP Toolkit, QuickBooks, Zoom) and I’d like to have one database I use for all the things. I currently have 3 other SLPs with me and am needing software that can bill clients, have a client portal to include intake info, a place to store treatment plans and daily notes, and a platform for teletherapy. I’ve looked at both Simple Practice and Theranest. With Simple Practice, the price goes up quite a bit when you add additional clinicians. And I’ve heard Theranest isn’t as easy to use (I need something easy and straightforward). I was curious if anyone has any thoughts on these two EMR systems or recommends something else?

Thanks so much!

I decided to go with Simple Practice, for now, and it seems pretty all encompassing and user friendly.
Anyone have additional tips on using it? Or anything I should use in addition to it to document? 
Also, I didn't see an area for patient to sign for treatments (like a sign into the visit), is this a thing I am missing?

If you work with any insurance companies and aren't implementing RTM into your practice, you're missing out on thousands of dollars of extra income per year that is 99% passive with the correct software once you setup the workflow in your system.

I've been utilizing SaRa Health https://www.sarahealth.io/ for RTM and I cannot say enough good things about their software and development team working with them has been an absolute breeze. It is completely hands off once you take the 30 seconds to setup the patient in the system. They take everything from their from messaging the patient and even tell you what to document in your note and what codes to bill. They notify you when to check in with a patient if a response is "abnormal" and give me a summary of responses over the past month.

This is a must with any practice that bills Medicare and private insurance.

Doe those of you with PTAs working with you in outpatient at home or mobile practices, how and when are you doing supervisory visits? I’ve seem multiple things about timing and PTA vs OTA at 10 visit vs 30 days and there is both state regulations and APTA guidelines (not mandatory). We are in massachusetts and  I believe supervisory visits have to be every 30 days, but with PN being every 10 visits its making more work than it feels is necessary and i want to make sure I have this accurate and I think this may have come from the APTA guideline and not the state reg so not sure it needs to be followed? I’m attaching the regulation I found in our state doc - I’m reading this now thinking the PTA does not have to be on-site during these visits??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We provide care in CT and RI (Mobile), and have not been doing a 30 day supervised visit with our PTAs. On visit 10 we are doing a PN. When co-signing daily notes, our EMR gives us the option to add a “supervision note.” If the PTA and I spoke about the client, I’ll write 1-2 sentences recapping any pertinent information.

Received a job offer to be a home health OT as an independent contractor, which I have not been before. This company typically provides aide and nursing services, and is just starting up providing therapies. of course I would be having my own liability insurance, but what would be the other risks involved with signing on to a company that is so new to offering therapies? Feeling a little overwhelmed and hesitant to sign the contract

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Risks would include them limiting how many visits you could do or ending the contract when they are unsuccessful at implementing the knew program. Make sure they are paying you enough if you are 1099. You should be getting 20% more as a 1099 compared to w2. Also, use it as am opportunity to build your business. Make sure they will let you hire COTAs through your business which is contracted with them so they can do some of your visits for you. Then go out and find more contracts like that. 
Oh and make sure they contract your LLC, not you directly. 
Shoot me a message if you want to discuss it further.

Calling all PTs and OTs in the Toledo, Ohio area! Are you interested in doing home modification evaluations for Medicaid clients? This includes recommendations for durable medical equipment, bathroom modifications, ramp recommendations, vehicle lift assessments, etc. Our company, Strategic Operating Solutions (SOS), is hiring a therapist (PT or OT, no PTAs or COTAs) to work primarily Lucas County, and occasionally in the surrounding counties (Fulton, Wood, and Ottowa). If you’re interested, please send me a direct message and I will give you the contact information for the hiring manager.

As I’m about to hire more therapists for my team I’m curious

Do you have titles for your “lead” therapists

I don’t like “lead” but want to give a title to someone whose full time and will have some other power vs part time or per diem therapists so families respect her like they do me.

This can be fun! What are you thoughts!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I promoted four of my therapists to lead roles. lead PT, lead OT and a few coordinator positions

Hi everyone! I work for a more traditional (but pretty awesome) PT company. We want to start offering some cash based personal training type services- what are some names for therapy adjacent services? I guess we could say we are offer personal training? I’m thinking we would offer Wellness type visits where you don’t need skilled care anymore but you want to keep stretching, working on strength, etc and I was trying to think of a better name? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wellness visits sound great. You could offer a tiered membership system: turn patients into clients/members. So they have access if they would like. And then offer some à la cart ￼options of personal training, and updated exercise programs. So like quarterly updates from PT are one membership tier, and semi-annually is another tier. Constant steady income while creating a community of wellness and rehab

It would be about 1 day/week. I have very few patients right now in my mobile business (currently side hustle) so am definitely open to this opportunity. 
What should I propose charging for my time as an independent contractor? It will be cash-pay. What other questions should I be asking?

EMR question -- I know this has been discussed quite a bit on here, but EMR are always updating. I currently use Simple Practice and Trainerize as I do exercise programming for my wellness clients with monthly programs. Is there an EMR out there that has "trainerize like" capabilities? Or are they all more "rehab driven" and just have HEPs. I have all my own videos that I upload to Trainerize anyways, so I don't care about the video selection. Clients love how Trainerize has the calendar and accountability features, but I'd love to condense my EMR and Training App into one location. I've heard PTEverywhere might have these features and Jane with Physitrack -- but are they as robust as Trainerize? Thanks!!

Any Seattle folks out there?
We’re a small, just-getting-started company focused on strength training, balance, and overall wellness for older adults. We’re looking for another person who’s a PT, PTA, OT, COTA,or nurse—someone experienced in strength training, functional movement, and working with older adults—and who genuinely values fitness as part of their own life.

We’re not part of the traditional healthcare system, but exist independently to support people in staying strong, steady, and aging in place.

Just putting this out there in case someone is looking for something different. Flexible hours, in-home sessions, lots of autonomy, and room to grow with us.

We’re keeping it small and intentional—and while this isn’t full-time (yet), it could be a really great fit for the right person.

If this speaks to you—or if you know someone it might—please DM or email me. We’d love to chat.

Hi! For any clinicians in CA that are providing wellness services on top of PT, I’d like to have an in depth discussion on managing the ebb and flow between “wellness” and “physical therapy”. We offer 1x/month membership type situations which works well for our clientele but of course needs are always changing and we have to shift with needing scripts vs not. 

Am curious if there’s any other more efficient ways of managing this on a systems and management level. 

Feel free to PM me TIA!

I am looking at leaving the hospital PT world and opening my own clinic.  I have 2 co-workers that I strongly believe would join me but do not want the risk of ownership.  That being said, I’m looking for opinions on whether I hire them to be employees of my clinic or do more of a “rental” type set-up where I own the building and they pay me a set amount each month and then take home anything above and beyond that.

EMR question -- I know this has been discussed quite a bit on here, but EMR are always updating. I currently use Simple Practice and Trainerize as I do exercise programming for my wellness clients with monthly programs. Is there an EMR out there that has "trainerize like" capabilities? Or are they all more "rehab driven" and just have HEPs. I have all my own videos that I upload to Trainerize anyways, so I don't care about the video selection. Clients love how Trainerize has the calendar and accountability features, but I'd love to condense my EMR and Training App into one location. I've heard PTEverywhere might have these features and Jane with Physitrack -- but are they as robust as Trainerize? Thanks!!

1. Is it possible to change repeating schedule starting on future date only?  I plan on changing my availability starting September 20th, but wanted to change on system now since some of my wellness maintenance will schedule months ahead.
2. I currently have very specific appointments times. To achieve that I have my work hrs like: 8-9:15, 9:15-10:30… and so on (my sessions are 1h with 15 in between). What is everyone’s experience with placing hrs as 8-4 and let square schedule? I am considering offering 45 min sessions. I am concerned with ending up with gaps in between…

I'm looking to switch and I know what I want in the new system. However I never took into account that I may need to keep the old EMR going for a while for billing purposes and costs seem to add up. Looking to see what I need to truly consider.

Is there an EMR/EHR with an HEP program/app in which a client can change the weight used? I’d really like to have one platform for coaching clients and PT patients rather than keeping them separate (and using two different systems). I’m currently using Everfit and looking at different programs within that realm (superset, kahunas, etc.). The other caveat is that the EMR would need to have Telehealth capabilities. Thank you!

I have seen a lot of discussion about professional liability insurance here. Can someone tell me if I get the group policy with CM & F does it cover individual as well? On the phone they say yes but when I filled out the application it did not ask me for specific names but I called and they said if I pay for the group policy they can give me a certificate with the individual therapists names on it. Does that mean they will be covered if a suit only mentions their name? Or do I get a separate policy for each individual therapist?

Looking for perspectives on discovery calls and coaching/wellness. I use Jane for EMR. I have scheduled discovery/complimentary consultation calls (virtual) through Jane, with some individuals ultimately not being appropriate for and/or choosing not to move forward with care. I don't want to mess up my metrics on Jane when I go to look quarterly/at the end of the year as I can't just delete these clients out of the system afterwards.

Does anyone schedule their discovery calls and wellness/coaching clients through a system outside of their standard EMR? I have heard of Practicebetter, IntakeQ, Calendly, etc. I would love to keep it all in one place, but not sure if there is a better way to do things.

TIA!

For those of you who take insurance. How are you scheduling? (Ie 30min appointment every hr? 45min appointment every 45) Do you think your clinic will still be profitable in 3yrs? 5? Or are you planning on transitioning to cash based services?

Hi all,
Are there any legal requirements or payer requirements in regards to creating an intake form and requiring new patients to fill out intake forms? (for the purposes of recording their PMH, PSH, symptoms, what they're coming in for, etc) OR can all of this information be collected/recorded during initial evaluation verbally as I am working with the patient? I am trying to figure out if I need any sort of record keeping for each of my patients when it comes to intake forms. Thank you!

**Original Post:**
Is the solo practice era coming to an end?
There are fear that the solo practitioner will be a rare, or thing of the past. True as that my seem; especially to those whose income and business model is married to third-party payers, there is also a growing part of healthcare clinicians may be ignoring. It is the cash-paying patient. OK, before you dismiss me, hear me out! Most insured Americans have high deductibles, making them cash patients up to 6 or 12k (whatever their deductible is). In addition, a growing part of the population is without insurance. Combined, these two groups make up 51% of Americans. So, why are we bothering to fight with insurance companies when most patients cannot use it even when they have it? Because we have always looked to insurance companies to tell us what we are worth.
Here is the problem with processing insurance for patients with high deductibles. The overhead goes up by multiples whenever insurance companies have to put their blessing on your claim. Insurance is essential; however, it is now only for catastrophic events. Recurring healthcare should be cash-based.
That brings us to the how? How do you start a cash practice? Several platforms on the market can help. Because I am a clinician and a software engineer, I created a marketplace that allows all the providers and me on the platform to state what they charge and the insurances they accept. In turn, I drive patients to the platform, and they get to choose a provider based on price, insurance accepted, distance from the provider, reputation rating, etc. The platform takes the provider to the discomfort of negotiating prices with patients. Furthermore, when the patients book appointments, they pay online, so I do not have to employ an army of people to collect my money. All the providers on Hutano have told me they love how the idea of a marketplace like this saves time and money.
Overhead is a real issue in healthcare. And it comes in two flavors, fixed and variable. Fixed overhead may be what it is. Meaning there is little you can do about it. Variable overhead, on the other hand, you can manage with technology.
I hear healthcare is complicated more often than I can count. But is it that different from other industries? Actually, not really! Consider this; there are five essential steps to accessing and providing primary healthcare. Finding a healthcare provider, booking an appointment, completing paperwork, receiving care, and follow-up care. If we figure out how to create technology that addresses the inefficiencies in each step, we will have fixed healthcare - at least primary care.
Traditionally, healthcare tends to mesh many technologies together and hope everything will work out. Inevitably we solve upstream problems without applying any thought to the downstream issues.
Let me give an example. Suppose you use  Zoc Doc to automate and manage scheduling. Great! Your patients find you and book appointments efficiently. However, your waiting room is still packed with patients filling out paperwork. And yes! your patients still wait 45 minutes plus to receive care. At the end of the day, you are overwhelmed despite the efficient scheduling. So what is the solution?
Software should make our lives more efficient. Unfortunately, no software on the market addresses the inefficiencies in each of the five steps. Practice management software should make finding providers and booking appointments as simple as Zoc Doc. Furthermore, patients should be able to fill out the intake, attach pertinent medical documents like imaging and lab reports, then pay for medical services online. By the time a patient walks into the clinic, the provider should be armed with all they need to diagnose and treat. But why stop there? The information a patient just entered into their intake could transfer automatically into the HPI portion of the encounter note. That way, by the time a provider starts writing a note, the patient has filled out the chief complaint, medical and social histories, medication list, preferred pharmacy, and even their vitals if that is something they can do at home. So the clinician's time can be more effectively spent interpreting the objective measures in your tests and measures, assigning a diagnosis and treatment plan. It would be great if follow-up appointments were set up in the EMR and sent directly to the patient's phone. Lastly, it would be great for any outside referrals to be managed directly in the EMR, sending referrals directly to other clinicians with access to treatment notes upon acceptance or referral.
My point is that technology saves time and money because; and clinicians will not need to employ people to schedule and manage appointments. Instead, like an airline, patients can book and manage their appointments.
I created a platform three years ago that does what I just shared with you. Twelve other providers and I are on the Hutano platform, and the results have been encouraging. And, as a solo, cash-based practitioner, my time is no longer bogged down with administrative tasks. So, please visit us at Hutano.com to set up your free account, and let me know how I can help your practice be more efficient.
As a software engineer and clinician, I consult with other clinicians. Please let me know if I can be a resource for your practice. Ephraim Makuve, PT, DPT, MBA HA. www.hutano.com | also available on the Appstore and Google Play Store

Business address question:

Hello, for those who use UPS mailbox/ virtual mailing address, do you just submit USPS FORM 1583 as proof when applying for business license? 

Also, will I be able to submit out of city business application where mailbox is located because of home city address asking for forms I am unable to provide like property owner declaration and site plan even when they allow virtual offices. I am unable to use my home address due to apartment and landlord not wanting to sign any business related forms.

Appreciate any insight! 🙏🙏🙏

Haven’t started yet, but looking into performance training outside of my full-time PT work. Looking for what I would need for intake paperwork for clients including personal information for them to fill out as well as the legal forms I would need them to sign. I’ve looked online and most sites I’ve checked seem to have a lot of paperwork for the client. Not sure all of it is needed. Additionally, I would like to be able to offer this to them either as a hard copy or a fillable electronic form, but I’m not sure how to make the fillable electronic forms. Any help is appreciated. Thanks

Hi! Quick question about Hellonote.
We have recently hired a PTA for my practice in Texas. When she sees and documents for a patient will Hellonote automatically send the document for co-signing to the assigned PT? Or do we need to do something on the back end?
Appreciate any response

Good evening! I’m going to be hiring a 1099 physical therapist for very limited hours based on their availability.  This will be my first “hire.”  What documents do I legally need to have them fill out? I know the 1099 NEC, but as far as like policies and procedures or things like no tolerance to sexual harassment etc?  I am also thinking of paying for Gusto, but I’m not going to be using it for payroll right now, just management of HR Stuff so would rather save those few dollars if I can.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

For those who hire independent contractors- What software do you use to manage contractor timesheets, invoices, and payments? 

I contract directly with facilities for therapy services and have just added my first subcontractors. I can't spend much, but am hoping to find a program to streamline the financial side of things. 

Ideally digital timesheet entry for the contractor that automatically populates invoicing and direct deposits. I don't need documentation capabilities or insurance billing.

I’m looking to hire someone for my mobile practice. I’d like to hire a part time front office person and a part time clinician.

I have no idea where to start. Already talked to my accountant, so that’s fine. I have no idea what I need to do, legally, I guess.

Can someone give me some pointers?

Those who have a mobile/clinic model practice WITH EMPLOYEES: how do you structure your employees visits? 
Do you have some that only do mobile? Then some that only do clinic? Or you let the employees decide what they want to do with the patients? 

We are a neuro clinic so once the patient progresses and/or family feels confident transfer them in and out of the car, we would love to be able to get them to the clinic to use our body weight support system for more walking and having more room for other activities etc. 
I am struggling a little bit as we grow to structure home vs clinic visits.

Hey everyone! Question...would I need another malpractice insurance if I would be treating a few people at my martial arts gym if I have one already from my 1099 independent contractor position for home health, or would that cover both? And anything else major just to start if I were to treat just a couple people at my martial arts studio? I have the checklist in my computer from the group but just making sure big basics are covered. Thanks!

**We're On A Mission To Put The Healing Back in Healthcare**

Here at Avethan, we believe in putting people first.

No gimmicks.

We also appreciate the need to solve complex healthcare business problems.

Sometimes the challenges could be more evident, with the practice generating less revenue with the cause not being known. In other instances, the practice may need an EHR project transition led, require HR assistance with their employee handbook, or are receiving less monthly traffic and need to know why.

No matter what the hindrance is, if it is causing a distraction for your team, it could affect your bottom line, patient safety, and staff morale.

Regardless of the challenges, Avethan exists so you can keep putting your patients, providers, support staff, vendor partners, and even the pharmaceutical representative that keeps calling about free lunches first.

Reach out today to schedule your free consultation.

Now that we are hiring staff, we have had some questions come up.
We are getting professional and general liability insurance with a company group policy which currently covers the W2 employees but we require the 1099 employees to get their own insurance. We do not have a supplemental auto insurance but we are looking into it. Any thing else we can do to reduce liability risk?

How do you keep your staff safe from harmful patients since they are one on one in the home? 

Any suggestions on the best lawyer to use for setting up a partnership agreement?
