You also need to vary your frequency to show the patient declines in quality of life and function with less therapy.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I have done this with 2 Medicare patients in the past. It took a lot of documentation and coordination with their provider to sign off on it when needed. The one was younger and was on disability his whole life due to a rare neuro disorder. We had years of history of him doing regular PT, discharging, declining and returning to PT. He did so well with the maintenance program!

I worked with someone today who was vacationing near me and said he went to an in-network place near him and when he convinced them to do some hands out work, he got about 8 min. He is an engineer, super diligent with his exercises and could use some more hands on assist. Hoping I can give him some ideas of ppl to get in touch with when he returns home in a couple of weeks.

Most portable machines (especially ones that can be purchased on Amazon) aren’t actually powerful enough to provide the kind of feedback to bounce back from true AMI after surgery unless meeting certain standards. Delaware produced a study not to long back looking at units and their ability to produce true motor recruitment. I have since switched to the Chattanooga portable unit (it’s about $400) and can be programmed for your patient and is a wonder!) I can forward this article. If you are using a non-portable Chattanooga device then try not using Russian estim setting, and instead trying utilizing symmetrical biphasic wavelength with 420+ phase duration and frequency of 55+ with cycle time of 10/50 for 15 mins. Still dial it up to reach borderline intolerable tetany. \n\n2) what are the size pads you are using? Wisconsin and a few other power 5s are utilizing 4x 8 inch pads and I got this tidbit about a year and half ago— I’ll never go back. For my smaller patients I’ll still never do smaller than 2x 4 inch pads. (Also noted in the Delaware study) the size of the pad allows you to recruit larger portions of all the muscles of the quadriceps and disperses the stim over a greater area allowing you to crank up the machine even higher and provide more electrical feedback. \n\n3) there is some recent research published as well on the utilization of ice specifically over the knee joint itself (basically just the patella and patellar and quad tendons and you can even put the same on the backside of knee joint) DO NOT GET ICE ON ANY SURROUNDING MUSCLE TISSUE (aka not on calves or quads) for about 10 mins immediately prior to activity. It shocks the joint proprioceptors to pay better attention to the joint motion and will decrease pain response which may be contributing to the AMI itself. \n\nI would try all of the above changes before ditching estim … anddd I would do all of this with quad sets so it’s not a difficult exercise when they are getting used to increased biofeedback/stimulation.(Estim should not be ditched before 80% LSI is achieved— which is much later in most rehabs than most people discontinue it— this is what OSU protocol indicates- there may even be an article I can find to support this)\n\nThen…\n\n4) TKE/SLR etc can all be cheated with muscles that work when you have AMI— I would switch to exercises that isolate (as much as possible the VMO) like SAQ AND ISO LAQ- although formerly believed to be taboo it’s extremely important to integrate E-stim with SAQ AND utilize E-stim with iso LAQ (belted at 60-90 deg— due to early precautions then progress) as quickly as possible in rehab (I have integrated it as early as 2 weeks post op given my patient is comfortable with 90deg flexión and min/no swelling)— estim with these two exercises specifically will help much more with the VMO (albeit the patient usually feels a bit uneasy about them— especially if it’s a quad tendon repair because they feel a bit of a tug)\n\nyour patient is 5 weeks post op so they should be able to tolerate both of these after changing parameters and pads with quad sets.

I get a call from a law firm asking for an ex employee to sign an affidavit stating that all the PT treatment provided from a car accident was medically necessary. I share the employee is no longer there, they ask for another PT to sign it (and they changed the name on the form as the reviewer, kept that treatment was from original therapist). \n\nI ask, wouldn’t you have another uninvolved PT do this who isn’t within the company? I was told no, it doesn’t matter, just any PT. The person, paralegal I’m assuming, was trying to down play it like “most people just sign it haha”\n\nSo lemme ask: isn’t that a weak argument that the PT who treated would of course say treatment was medically necessary? And same, for a PT at the same company. \n\nAlso- isn’t this thing supposed to be paid? $$$\n\n***update: I looked at the eval and notes , they were poorly done with virtually no objective info, so I declined to sign.

I get a call from a law firm asking for an ex employee to sign an affidavit stating that all the PT treatment provided from a car accident was medically necessary. I share the employee is no longer there, they ask for another PT to sign it (and they changed the name on the form as the reviewer, kept that treatment was from original therapist). \n\nI ask, wouldn’t you have another uninvolved PT do this who isn’t within the company? I was told no, it doesn’t matter, just any PT. The person, paralegal I’m assuming, was trying to down play it like “most people just sign it haha”\n\nSo lemme ask: isn’t that a weak argument that the PT who treated would of course say treatment was medically necessary? And same, for a PT at the same company. \n\nAlso- isn’t this thing supposed to be paid? $$$\n\n***update: I looked at the eval and notes , they were poorly done with virtually no objective info, so I declined to sign.

Here is what ChatGPT said:\n...\nOperating in a coaching or educational capacity without establishing a patient-clinician relationship is becoming increasingly common, but it does require clear boundaries to avoid legal issues. Here are some strategies and specific language that you can use to protect yourself and ensure you're not crossing the line into providing medical care:\n\n1. Disclaimers\nClearly state that your services are educational or coaching in nature, and not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Use disclaimers prominently on your website, in written materials, and at the beginning of your sessions. Example disclaimer:\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information provided during this session is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice or a patient-provider relationship. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your health or exercise routine.\"\n2. Language to Avoid & Alternative Phrasing\nAvoid language that implies direct care or treatment. Refrain from using terms like \"treatment,\" \"prescription,\" \"therapy,\" or \"diagnosis.\" Instead, use terms like:\n\n\"General guidance,\" \"educational information,\" \"suggestions,\" \"best practices,\" or \"insights.\"\nFor example:\n\nInstead of: \"I recommend you perform these exercises.\"\nUse: \"These exercises are commonly used for people experiencing similar symptoms, but please discuss this with your healthcare provider to determine if they're right for you.\"\n3. Clarify Your Role\nMake it clear that you are acting as a coach or educator, not a healthcare provider in this context. Examples:\n\n\"I am providing this information as a coach/educator, not as a healthcare provider.\"\n\"Our interaction today is intended to provide general information and education, and does not establish a clinical relationship.\"\n4. Encourage Seeking Medical Advice\nAlways direct individuals to seek personal medical advice from their healthcare provider for specific questions or issues:\n\n\"Please consult with your physician or healthcare provider before implementing any changes or if you have specific concerns about your condition.\"\n5. Avoid Providing Individualized Treatment Plans\nAvoid crafting specific treatment plans or exercises tailored to an individual’s specific condition without an assessment, as this could be interpreted as practicing physical therapy. Instead, focus on providing generalized information:\n\nInstead of: \"Based on your symptoms, you should do these exercises.\"\nUse: \"These are some common exercises that people find helpful for this type of issue. Please discuss them with your provider to determine if they are suitable for you.\"\n6. Document Everything\nIf you are operating online, maintain records of any interactions and ensure that disclaimers are present in emails, websites, or any digital communications. This documentation can be valuable in showing your intent and the nature of the relationship.\n\n7. Terms of Use Agreement\nIf you have a website or provide online courses, create a Terms of Use Agreement that participants must accept. This should outline:\n\nThe nature of the relationship (educational vs. therapeutic).\nClear disclaimers of liability.\nLimitations of your services.\n8. Consent for Coaching Sessions\nIf you provide one-on-one coaching, get explicit consent from the individual, acknowledging that:\n\n\"This session is for educational purposes only, and no patient-clinician relationship is being established.\"\nHaving them sign a consent form helps protect both parties and establishes boundaries.\n\n9. Understand Scope of Practice Laws\nDifferent states or regions have different laws about what is allowed without a license. Make sure to review local regulations regarding your professional capacity, especially as a physical therapist. For example, the use of certain titles (like \"Physical Therapist\") can imply a clinical relationship, which could create liability issues. Instead, you could use titles such as \"Health Coach\" or \"Wellness Educator\" for clarity.\n\nThese measures can help ensure you stay within the bounds of providing coaching or educational services without crossing into clinical practice, reducing legal risks while still providing value to your audience.", "date": "2024-10-05 18:54:26", "author_id": "100002916961058", "comment_url": "https://www.facebook.com/groups/uncagedcliniciangroup/posts/1569629570474936/?comment_id=1569632290474664"}, {"text": "Yea you need to be clear and have a waiver or disclaimer, but the question is “will it stand up in court?”Anyone wanting to sue you will go for your highest license because it means a bigger settlement.

I am a physical therapist and have 16 years experience, with the last 11.5 years being in home health with a mostly geriatric population. In my work with senior patients, I find that most of them won’t keep up with their exercise routine after I discharge. I get it. It’s really hard to start and stick with an exercise routine when no one is holding you accountable. But when they don’t keep up their exercises, they usually lose the progress they made with me and end up weaker, often falling and breaking something, at which point they’re referred back for therapy again and we start back at square one (or even further back). I wish insurance companies would pay for regular, ongoing therapy visits to prevent this kind of decline, but the reality is that they just don’t. The patients I treat are homebound, so going to an outpatient clinic usually isn’t an option.

To have a business that offers only wellness visits to seniors. No skilled physical therapy service, which means it is not billed to insurance and does not require a plan of care. It would be private pay only with visits as often as the client wants. Almost like having a personal trainer come to the home but with the knowledge and training of a physical therapist. The goal would be to assist clients in performing their home exercises and establishing an overall wellness routine, while also being able to monitor patients for red flags that their doctor may need to know about (like signs of infection, high blood pressure, low oxygen, etc) in order to prevent avoidable hospitalizations. Does anyone here have a practice like this? Is this a service you think you, your parents, or your grandparents would use?

Also, the Herman and Wallace Institute allows a wide array of providers to take their courses, including Naturopathic Doctors. Many other pelvic floor courses can be taken by others. I know a personal trainer that calls her self a pelvic floor therapy specialist and states she has multiple pelvic floor certifications. So if it is the scope of treatment for Natropathic Doctors to perform and they have the skill set then I suspect they could bill. I see many different professions calling themselves pelvic floor specialists from holistic doctors to nurse midwives to personal trainers. Also, they are typically skillful with the wording calling it pelvic floor therapy instead of pelvic floor physical therapy."}

I had a conversation with our clinic owners and was told they have no issue with me sharing my professional email or social media with patients to ask questions/keep in touch, and if that leads to them choosing to treat with me then so be it. They did ask that I do not share specifics of my plan, such as treating mobile, etc, unless asked after my departure from the clinic, which I more than understand.\nSo for now, I will just be passing that info along, if asked, and keep advocating for the new PT coming in because he’s a great new grad with a lot of love for the profession🙂\n\nCOMMENT 2: Maybe I'm the odd one out here, but when I left my job to open my own practice I \"poached\" pretty much every one of my active patients. \nContext. I am a pelvic floor PT. I was honest with everyone that I was leaving on X date, and was leaving to start my own private practice. I didnt ask any of them if they wanted to come with me, but every single patient asked if they could continue their care with me at my new location.

I think that for too long PT has been a crutch for people who need accountability.\n\nCOMMENT 2: As Abby Regan said, the minute the conversation becomes “I want you to…” vs “you need…” it’s wellness. How many times have patients begged you not to DC them from therapy even when it’s not medically necessary. “But I just can’t do it with it you, you encourage me and I do it better with you.” \n\nWhat they are asking for is personal training paid for by insurance.

I’ve heard “it’s based on your highest level of education” but I also have colleagues that perform dry needling as ATC. Any insight would be helpful. Thanks!!!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Sorry, I have no input, but that scenario is insane. Mind blown.\n\nCOMMENT 2: So ATCs are not regulated in  CA, no governing body to dictate what can and cannot be done within the state. As far as dry needling, my understanding was that in CA it can only be performed by acupuncturists and MDs. Weird loophole it seems.

However, I’m curious—do you think a certification is necessary? Have you run into any liability concerns?\n\nAlso, if you’re a mobile PT, I’d love to hear how you incorporate it in a home setting! Any insights would be greatly appreciated!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Hey I recommend getting certified as well, but you can also start integrating the work while you get certified. Happy to answer any questions.\n\nCOMMENT 2: I incorporate it into my general PT practice.  Sometimes it is billed as treatment.  If it is for maintenance then it is cash based.

That track is geared toward the various fitness instructor roles, and can of course also be taken by clinicians.\n\nRock Steady is by default a wellness/exercise based certification. You can get certified as a therapist and could use the ideas in your practice, but you would not be providing the skills of your discipline. It would be a Rock Steady class. \n\nAs far as I know, there are only clinician certifications for LSVT BIG. There is BIG for Life, though, which may be something other fitness instructors qualify to get certified in. I frankly haven't seen many of those classes, and there's a prerequisite for the patient/client to have already gone through and graduated from a full round of LSVT BIG.\n\n...\n\nI am certified in both PWR and LSVT BIG as a clinician. I have a mobile therapy model and rarely use LSVT BIG because it's exhausting to me personally, and because most of my clients would struggle with the intensity due to age, anxiety, orthopedic concerns, etc.\n\nI plan to get certified as a PWR Moves Instructor, which is way more focused on building an exercise class. As a therapist, I highly value both PWR certification tracks. (I might also get a personal training cert.)\n\nKeep in mind that if you do mobile THERAPY visits, most of these folks have Medicare or a Medicare replacement plan with out of network benefits.

I know a lot of personal trainers teach PWR classes…community word of mouth, no formal referrals\n\nCOMMENT 2: In order to officially offer PWR, LSVT BIG, or Rock Steady, you would need to take the respective courses to get certified.\n\nTo offer PWR as a non-therapist, you could get certified as an instructor. That track is geared toward the various fitness instructor roles, and can of course also be taken by clinicians.\n\nRock Steady is by default a wellness/exercise based certification. You can get certified as a therapist and could use the ideas in your practice, but you would not be providing the skills of your discipline. It would be a Rock Steady class. \n\nAs far as I know, there are only clinician certifications for LSVT BIG. There is BIG for Life, though, which may be something other fitness instructors qualify to get certified in. I frankly haven't seen many of those classes, and there's a prerequisite for the patient/client to have already gone through and graduated from a full round of LSVT BIG.\n\n...\n\nI am certified in both PWR and LSVT BIG as a clinician. I have a mobile therapy model and rarely use LSVT BIG because it's exhausting to me personally, and because most of my clients would struggle with the intensity due to age, anxiety, orthopedic concerns, etc.\n\nI plan to get certified as a PWR Moves Instructor, which is way more focused on building an exercise class. As a therapist, I highly value both PWR certification tracks. (I might also get a personal training cert.)\n\nKeep in mind that if you do mobile THERAPY visits, most of these folks have Medicare or a Medicare replacement plan with out of network benefits. Unless you only want to work with YOPD or only want to do exercise classes, I strongly recommend you examine the rules for Medicare billing. The Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group can help with that area."}

I’ve always been a big yoga person but today I took my first Pilates class and WOW! Such important pieces of strengthening. And I was so so happy to see this class was mostly seniors which is my niche.
