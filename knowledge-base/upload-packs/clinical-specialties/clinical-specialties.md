**Original Post:**
**There’s been a lot of “noise” lately about physical therapy no longer being labeled a “professional” degree by the Department of Education.**

Here’s the reality: **the public doesn’t care—and honestly, it doesn’t change a thing about what we do.**

Most patients don’t know (and don’t need to know) the difference between “professional,” “clinical,” “terminal,” or any other academic label. What they *do* care about is:
* Can you help them move better?
* Do you reduce their pain?
* Do they trust you with their health?

That’s what defines us—not a classification on a federal spreadsheet.

While others get caught up in titles, labels, and politics, the real work continues: helping people get back to living their lives. The value of PT has always been built in treatment rooms, gyms, and patient relationships… not in the Department of Education’s nomenclature.

Let’s keep our focus where it matters. The rest is just noise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When the APTA proposed the doctorate level of entry to our field it was to increase our view as a medical professional. I have been a PT for 40 years. The fact that chiropractors are viewed as professional and not PTs is demonstrating the  view of our profession. If it is about repayment of government loans, on average they earn less than us. As do theologians. I disagree so much with this post. If we are no longer allowed loans from the government we must seek out private funding. Profits going to banks and financial institutions. Will this lower costs, i hope so but I doubt it. Our issue as a profession is partially the way we are viewed by the public. Perhaps, Go back to the BS in PT if we are no longer professionals and stop saddling new therapists with unnecessary financial burden or perhaps unleash us from the burden of Medicare reimbursement limits and allow us to opt out. We should not need MDs to sign off on our POC. We should be fully autonomous. Then the DPT and the cost of this degree would make sense. Unleash us and allow us to be independent or change our degree back to a BS for entry level. During this time in PT history people still obtained Masters and doctorates degrees but they were  advanced practice in an area of study. I don’t know the answer but I do feel as a profession we should be questioning this and think hard about how we are perceived and our future. I would NOT make light of this decision.

> **Response 2:** What a small minded / ignorant comment this isn’t about the public.  Who cares what the public think they don’t know half of what goes on in the politics of healthcare. Heath-care and our jobs at the end of day is based on politics. This  is about the future profession and the ability for future healthcare providers like physical therapist, Nurses,and  occupational therapist to be able to afford going to school. All this is doing is elevating the wealthy to do us a please and again putting barriers for people of low income to pursue a better life. And not to mention how it affects reimbursement. I mean why would  insurance companies pay well for a non professional job? You tell me. This is what they’ve been waiting for. 

people like you are exactly the issue. 
I’m fine, I paid for school easily - so what’s the problem. It’s not able the label itself, it’s how it impacts the future of our role as a provider in the financial health care system.  . 

Kick rocks.

**Original Post:**
Hi there!  Are you a member of APTA?  Why or why not? Thanks! 

(Full disclosure, I am on the MN APTA board and talking to national APTA to learn why people are not members and how APTA can support the independent PTs. I have always said APTA doesn’t bring value to people like us but I wanted to hear from you). Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not any more. 

I had payed APTA dues and multiple section dues every year since I started PT school in 1997. I budgeted to pay  over $1000 a year to APTA to cover state and national dues, Ortho section, Sports Section, Private Practice section, and Women’s Health section when my employers didn’t cover it. 

I attended numerous APTA annual conferences and CSM and paid for employees to attend those conferences too. 

I donated $$ to the Political Action Committee. 

I volunteered my time to serve on the House of Delegates in my state and assisted with State Chapter Task Force initiatives to fight to protect our ability to perform joint manipulation and dry needling. 

When I opened my own private practice in 2012 I paid in full for all my clinicians to have an APTA and state PT association membership and 1 section membership.

This year I made the decision for the first time in 25+ years to cancel my APTA membership -  their ongoing lack of support for those of us who are independent private practice clinicians and the true issues we are facing daily is utterly disappointing and I don’t feel hopeful it will improve.

Over my career I have only seen and experienced;
*increasing administrative & documentation burdens
*Inadequate & declining reimbursement rates
*flat lining of salaries for experienced clinicians not commiserate to their skill, training, advanced certification 
* reduced PT insurance benefits for beneficiaries 
*increasing productivity demands due to falling reimbursement and rising operational costs 
* plummeting morale from those of us that have been in our profession for any time working thru these challenges and burdens
*lack of action from APTA to do anything about these PT mill clinics that unethically schedule/bill in clear violation of payer contracts

> **Response 2:** There’s not much value…the “advocacy” has not been a priority. And because it has not been a priority,PT is becoming an unsustainable profession. How do you keep serving your community when business costs keep rising and reimbursements keep dropping? The amount of education, continuing education, time and volume needed to succeed are not reflected in the what you bring home at the end of the day and it’s almost like the APTA has never fully addressed this growing concern. And this is why so many of us have turned to cash based services which quite honestly makes the APTA largely irrelevant.

Would anyone be interested in a training around the "hydrogen" water that's being taken over by social media (Gary Breka, Joe Rogan, etc). I was asked to speak on it for another setting and since I'll have my materials together I figured I could offer to my uncaged people as well. It would include the uses and current research around the subject so you can be educated and answer questions from your athletes/clients.

Not sure where else to ask this question, but if someone is a DPT…(I am not) is it legal to just put PT after your name where required? Found out a hospital system is forcing DPTs to drop the D.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PT, DPT

> **Response 2:** PT is your license.

DPT is your degree.

2 different things.

**Original Post:**
c'mon APTA!!  step up and protect our profession from this false advertising!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I hate it to break it to ya, but the APTA doesn’t care. 

Vision 2020 was an absolute joke. They lied to an entire generation of PTs. Almost NOTHING was achieved. Lies and absolute deceit. 

I would love for all of us with DPT degrees to join forces and file a class action lawsuit against the APTA. 

These people should pay for the destruction they have done to an entire profession and the financial ruin they’ve left thousands of people in. 

I wouldn’t give two rusty nickels to the APTA. 

And before anyone tries to “school” me on the good the APTA does, just know this, there are thousands of DPTs who feel like me. Heck, there are thousands of PTs from all education levels that feel similar.

Absolutely useless. 

I can’t even work in wound care anymore. Why? Because the APTA, once again, gave something within our scope to nurses. NOW, LPNs and RNs get ALL of the wound care jobs. 

Incredible. 

Save your gaslighting, virtue signaling, and “feel good” lecture for someone else. I’ve heard it all over the last 10 years. “Feel good” stories and fighting dry needling laws doesn’t pay bills and feed families.

You want to actually DO something, here’s a start: 

1. Fight for wound care. 
2. Fight for increased reimbursements. 
3. Fight to expand our scope. And NO, I’m not talking about stupid dry needling. I want MEANINGFUL scope expansion - we should be granted roles similar to NP or PA. 

I would give anything to go back in time. Now, at my age, and with the absurd debt I have from the useless DPT degree, I can’t afford in money or time, to pursue PA or NP. 

Join forces with the AMA and the national nursing associations to create a bridge program for DPT to NP or PA. 

We should be able to pursue other areas and fields within medicine. We should NOT be chained to rehab and orthopedics. 🤮 I am SO sick of being put in a box!! 

We should be able to do a 1-2 year residency alongside a PA or NP, in addition to minimal didactic work to fill in any gaps, to be qualified to sit for PA or NP boards. 

We NEED options! 

I believe in the power of movement as a first line of treatment for many conditions, but that is NOT the model for the American healthcare system. 

We need to figure out a way to work WITH and not against physicians, PAs, and nurses, or we will continue to be pushed aside until the profession folds. 

I’ve had this gripe for a decade and a lot of what I predicted is happening (sadly). 

For years I’ve talked about continuous decline in reimbursements. For years I’ve talked about decreasing scope of practice. 

It’s happening every day. Wake up!

> **Response 2:** This is a private group so the APTA cannot view this

**Original Post:**
I know none of us is a radiologist, but can anyone take a look at this and confirm or deny what I’m seeing? 

This is my husbands most recent lumbar MRI. He’s been dealing with moderate to debilitating pain with radicular symptoms to the left leg for almost 18 months now. Before the onset of pain he was swimming competitively 4-5x/wk and playing soccer 2x/wk, with general workouts including lifting (not heavy) and jogging several times weekly.  He was in excellent shape.  His symptoms are often all over the place (come and go with no real reason), range in locations (from mid back to foot and everywhere between, including intermittent saddle area sensations but no loss of bowel or bladder control), and frequently don’t make sense (several months ago he had extreme L QL pain to even light palpitation that caused immediate severe pain in the L knee and foot; when lying flat in prone or supine he can’t take a deep breath without feeling L foot pain or L butt pain depending on which direction his head is turned). I consider myself pretty smart, but I’ve exhausted my knowledge base at this point. 

He’s had FIVE spinal specialists (including Mayo clinic in jacksonville) give opinions on his back, and almost all of them have said “yeah L4/L5 and L5/S1 have mild to moderate disc bulging but its not that bad - just do PT or get an injection.” We were looking at his MRI today, and no one has EVER mentioned S2, but to me this looks like a pinch point.

I looked up S2 spinal compression and Tarlov cysts come up, but this looks like compression from the posterior side, not a cyst growth from the sacrum. 

Anyone have thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am near Inverness Fl
I love a challenge
I also see the connection between the T/S, QL and pelvic floor;  he probably initially had a stiff t/s then injured the QL which led to muscle spam and doesn’t really have endurance in his deep core muscles 

I do a ton of manual and see great results- would be happy to help as i know how frustrating it is to have pain

> **Response 2:** Pelvic Floor Occupational Therapy; What is he doing for pain management? What is he doing for down regulating his nervous system? What is his work station like? What is he doing for exercise? Stretching? Is he constipated? How is this impacting his ADLs or lifestyle?

Hey guys! I have been growing an online running coaching business and I have athletes all over the US. The focus is on a lot of distance running so clearly aches and pains often pop up. I'd love to start a referral list for PTs in different areas and thought it would be great to ask this group!

I am looking for PTs that are proficient in outpatient ortho/sports med. Experience working with runners is a big plus but also I'd like clinicians with strong manual therapy skills. Please DM me if you are interested in developing a connection! And give me details on what you offer (dry needling, insurance vs cash pay, etc). 

Thank you so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks everyone!! Keep them coming. I'll be in touch and share the list too once I compile all the info 🙂 (as long as that is allowed!!)

> **Response 2:** Hello Brianne Vannucci, I am in Ohio between Cleveland and Columbus. I have 8 years of experience in outpatient ortho! My manual skills include but are not limited to Dry needling, IASTM, Muscle activation techniques, muscle energy techniques and I believe that using manual therapy and help get my clients better-faster! I'd love to connect. We actually have a lot of runners in the area and I would love to see how your coaching could help them be successful as well 🙂 looking forward to talking with you! 

PS, I couldn't DM you but wanted to message you!

What extra certifications do you all have that you have found compliments your traditional PT services? Personal training? Yoga? Meditation? Aging in place certifications? Others....? I am wondering if I should add something to my services...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Only add what will educate you to care for your patients the way you want.  There’s no best certification.  I have very few certifications and I rarely talk about them.  If you’re “wondering” then I’d say you don’t need anything.  If you see to learn a skill to help your clients better do that and don’t worry about if it’s certified or not.  Certified just means you completed the program to the organizer’s standard.  It attracts clients who gravitate toward name brands.

> **Response 2:** Certified Manual therapist. Certified Pilates Instructor. Two great adjuncts to Orthopedic PT practice.

Clinical question: What needs to be done to get him into more extension? He is a patient post stroke if that matters.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Anthony Maritato define do fine.  I challenge you to live your life with chronically flexed knees.  NOW.  Every day until the day you die.  GO.  Enjoy!!!

There are lots of people who do fine with bilaterally flexed knees.

What do you think? Is this person avoiding  surgery? 35 yrs old, doesn't want Fusion and rods. I can help her but not sure it'll be enough to avoid surgery.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Surgery only with red flag symptoms… bowel/bladder changes, progressive muscle wasting/weakness, etc. 

Surgery for pain is a coin flip at best, dangerous at worst.

He’s 35… if otherwise healthy and uncomplicated non-surgical prognosis should be favorable. Natural history is favorable. Disc material resorption is very possible and even if not there are probably a million asymptomatic people walking around who would have the same findings in MRI.

> **Response 2:** One of my favorite professor quotes: I’d have to be peeing on my own drop foot before I got rods in my back.

**Original Post:**
Seeking advice for my aunt…
I must be a dinosaur…It seems to me that a TKR should receive more frequent PT than only 2x/week in post-op home PT.
My formative days after PT school were spent in intensive rehab (which doesn’t seem to exist anymore). We saw TKR and THR BID 7 days from post op day 1 until they were D/c’d home from rehab.

I know the current trend is to send patients home on post op day 1 with HH PT….I fail to see how this is effective for rehab or achieving the minimal ROM…..
Am I missing something?  
Should my aunt (with Medicare) be receiving more than 2 45 minute sessions of PT per 7 day week or is this the new norm?  (I am horrified if so).
(Oh, and because it is a holiday week, she “might be seen”)

If this is the new norm, I am concerned that she’ll never get the ROM she needs to function.
So the next question is…how soon can we get her to OP PT and would that have better frequency of treatment? Will she have better outcomes if she transitions to OP PT after 1 week at home (vs 4 weeks of 2x/week).

Can you hear my frustration?  I cannot believe that this level of care has the same outcomes as my patients in the 1990’s.

I would love to hear thoughts and suggestions for how I can guide this care. Do we push it with the surgeon to require more PT?  
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Let’s find a mobile therapist in your area! She could do that in lieu of HH.  That way she would get better care (more than likely) and be getting out-patient care sooner - but in the home!

> **Response 2:** Honestly the biggest obstacle to overcome is fear, and for most people pain = breaking something which feeds their fear. I literally don’t even lay hands on a TKR for ROM as I teach the patients what they need to be doing, and the only problems I’ve had are ones I inherited from other therapists. I’d be💯comfortable doing a fresh TKR completely virtually. Same with other post op patients as well.

So a personal trainer can charge cash to a client with Medicare for training but a Physical therapist with a personal training certification cannot?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Use an ABN that states wellness, general conditioning is not a covered benefit.  Keep on file.  It’s good for a year.

> **Response 2:** You can. They just can’t have a physical ailment that your training could be considered treatment for. If it’s not skilled care (they finished a course of PT already) or they simply aren’t injured, you could provide cash based services that do not include a physical therapy skilled service/evaluation etc. you would want very clear signed paperwork to distinguish your services ofcourse. And look at your state specific practice act.

**Original Post:**
I have a client who's feeling really down about her TKR that she can't get full ROM out of. She's 4 months post op and current AROM is 6-103. Dr refuses to do a MUA bc he was worried he'd break her femur (she has extensive scar tissue from an accident thirty years ago). No other surgeon will touch it until she's a year post op. Right now we are continuing to stretch and stretch and stretch, but she's feeling frustrated and wanted to know how often this happens and what the outcomes are. I told her I'd poll the group bc I wasn't sure. Thank you for any input!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A few other considerations:
What was her ROM prior to TKR? In severe OA cases ROM can be quite compromised prior to Sx. Long term soft tissue contractures, muscle atrophy and fascial restrictions can take a long time to improve. 
Function is far more important than end ROM. 
Inflammation of local soft tissue and scarring can decrease over time. Patience is key. 
Pilates reformer exercises can work magic on TKRs.

> **Response 2:** My 2 cents:
1. How about focusing on function rather than pain. 
2. Her AROM is really good at 4 months, could also be that pain is inhibiting you from stretching further. Maybe she is over stretching and over doing her exercises. It is ok to decrease intensity and frequency to calm her pain down 
3. Icing is known to decrease C fiber activity. You can try stretch - ice massage- stretch- ice massage …my experience with TKR, their knee tend to get very hot with movement 
4. Educate and re assure that she is progressing well - if patient sees that you are worried, she gets worried as well which will contribute to her pain experience 
5. Celebrate small wins

In my 7 years of practice, I have seen several TKR  cases from many years ago who were not able to achieve full ROM but they are not limited to what they can do

Just sharing with like minds. This is my grandmas knee X-ray (permission to post). She has her TKA scheduled Tuesday this week. What the HECK!! Calcified quad tendon? Her joint surfaces actually look pretty good, right? I don’t read X-ray a lot but dang. How did this happen lol. And/or what the heck is this going on here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** i'm sure that a strength deficit from a dysfunctional quad tendon can make her buckle easily  and fall. How old is she, is she walking with a device. You can most certainly delay the surgery while you get a 2nd and 3rd opinion; A quad tendon repair will be no fun but more appropriate than a TKR.

> **Response 2:** There are clear osteophytes and a decrease in joint space. That looks like a clear case of knee OA to me. Surgeons always tell patients that they're the ones to say when it's time for surgery. So if she's in pain and it's limiting her day to day function, do the TKA.

Not sure if I can post this here - lmk where I can post if not allowed:
Update: 10/7/25 @6mos post-op (4/11/25 Surgery)
For those who commented on recs and knowledge, thank you! Here is the status of her shoulder. We’ve gotten 3 other opinions from ortho docs and they all agree it looks like it’s buldging out. One doc is calling the rep of the hardware company and asking what size was put in. Another Doc said it looks like it was placed at an angle and more lateral or anterior than he would’ve placed it. But that doesn’t mean that it warrants a revision. The deltoid appears to be missing anteriorly ??? but she’s able to flex at shoulder to 90*, 2/5 MMT w/ pain/wincing. The sunken look is progressively getting worse.  

We are hoping the rep says that a partial revision can be done to replace with a smaller disc between the neck of the hardware and the ball without replacing the entire set. Anyone have insight to this situation?!

Updated info: I need advice from ortho PTs.
My (medicare/75yo) mom’s reverse total shoulder 3.5 mos post-op prosthetic looks odd. 
It keeps catching w/ pain 10/10. Doc says it’ll take time and patience. He used an off-the-shelf prosthetic and says he rarely orders custom. Are off-the-shelf cheaper??? How can I be reassured it’s the correct size since he’s sure it’s the correct size? She was 120* should flexion and now 85* with bruising post 4 days ago, she reached up behind her head to put her sling on to just rest it and she got stuck 10/10 worst pain shes ever been in…she didnt hear a pop, but could it have dislocated? Doc says maybe so but didn’t give us a plan post subluxation. He said to rest it, dont do IR for awhile, and itll “heal”. 😳

So many red flags during our visit today showing no compassion and strong resistance to admitting anything other than she needs to be patient. He actually called to apoligized but it was a,”Im sorry, but…” apology.  Rated TOP REVERSE shoulder doc in Austin, TX and he said he is 1 of 6 who created this prosthetic!? What do we do? We have a 2nd opinion in a week. I’m in shock for my mom. 🙏 feri e t

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve treated many rTSA’s and just based on the images that DOES NOT LOOK NORMAL. Clearly she has significant atrophy so I’m concerned about nerve damage, but also the component doesn’t even look like it’s fitting properly. Yes reverse shoulder replacements can take six months up to a year to feel somewhat normal but if she is still struggling even with just functional movements, then a second opinion is absolutely needed. Hope that helps 🙏￼

> **Response 2:** Sulcus like that can be prothesis but more commonly the deltoid weakness and scapular mm weakness is not assisting stabilizing inferior component. The deltoid is essentially the new prime mover for elevation so rtc atrophy like that happens. She will never have normal g/h pattern thats just reality of the surgery. I have seen large sulcus’ like this- hardware was intact- there was just such long standing weakness . Rehab takes really long- lots of deltoid isometrics- I would make sure her PT is experienced in treating this.She could also have some adhesions forming limiting the rom and that is super painful too… (think freezing phase of frozen shoulder). I would also use kinesiotape if safe on her skin to stabilize

What is the general view of using manual muscle tests as an objective measure of progress? Our clinic is trying to steer few of us veterans away from using manual muscle tests and it feels like they just don't want to go through the hassle of doing them. I feel like they are really easy to do and can be measurable goals. They are also indicating that there's not enough inter-rater reliability, but that actually means to me that they require more skills in this area as opposed to me needing to simply use the manual muscle test less. Please give me your thoughts all for or opposed.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Research proves they're unreliable and they're not objective at all once you get higher than 3 where the strength becomes subjective based on the rater and proper stabilization and positioning. 
I think they can be helpful for low level patients but functional measures like STS and TUG are much more objective, repeatable, reliable and obviously functional.

> **Response 2:** There’s no harm in doing it. If you don’t want to use it for goal setting then fine, but it takes 2 seconds to perform and the patient also gets feedback about how their body is performing. Our profession is ridiculous when it comes to this stuff. If you don’t want to use it then don’t, but don’t go telling other not to do it because it does provide beneficial information when used in the grand scheme of an evaluation. I wouldn’t stop using them Janell Klosterman to influence your exam findings, but may choose to use other measures for goal setting based on insurance practices

What certifications and extra training has resulted in the biggest ROI for all you cash based peeps?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Short answer:
Dry Needling & any Pelvic Floor knowledge.

Long answer:
Learning about whatever I’m most passionate about — in formal and informal ways.  Me being excited & having solutions for my clients is more important than any single certification. 

Mentorships — informal from colleagues & formal online programs. 

Getting treatment from a wide variety of other providers.  Even a bad massage  has lessons to be learned. 

Manual therapy — if people like the quality of your touch, you’re gold.

I only dry needle ~50% of the people who specifically book asking for DN. Often they are relieved it’s optional.  

But yes, I do think DN is a good skill for cash PT — unless you can adequately compensate with other strengths.   

The more I learn about Pelvic Floor the more effective my sessions are.   Much more powerful than DN.   I only do external PF and it’s still been a game changer.  (Well PF Dry needling is great too!)

> **Response 2:** manual therapy cert.....the skills, not the extra letters.......and its not even close

What’s the hype around all these red light machines/beds? I’ve noticed a lot of PT’s starting “med-spa” like treatment styles in their clinics

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a unit in my clinic.   I have a small room/large closet size room that is perfect for it.
  Personally, I have chronic low back pain.  I will get on the table with the light for 20min in pain and have zero pain when I get off.   It’s extremely relaxing.   I was not expecting instant results but more benefits after routine sessions.  It was immediate results in my case.  
We have people use it for skin dermatitis, psoriasis with improved symptoms within 2-3 sessions.   I want to test it on neuropathy patients.

I have a Biomax panel and a stand that tilts horizontally so I can roll it on top of patient treatment areas with better proximity to the body.

> **Response 2:** I use a red light during session and if patient wants one I direct them in where to purchase. Very relaxing. I recommend reading and researching it more. It can be great for pain and inflammation.

To recertify a board-specialty…or not?

I would love some discussion from the hive mind to help me mentally work through this. 

I have a board specialty, and am proud of the hard work that went into obtaining it years ago, but beyond the initial boost in knowledge in my specialty area, I can’t say that I see it continue to pay off. 

I can think of LESS than a handful of clients in those years who said they found me because of the specialty or because someone recommended them to me because of the specialty. I can think of no referral sources who place it above location, reputation and relationship.

The costs are kind of outrageous. Over a 10 year MOSC cycle, $760 in MOSC fees. $470 each time for an every-3-yr required course, and an extra $200 in supplies if you don’t have them. $180 for an application review at the 10 yr mark, and $810 to sit for the recertification exam at the 10 yr mark (provided you’re an APTA member). That works out to  $3300 over 10 years. Just to have it!

This is having shades of a “sunk cost” fallacy.

New grads come out, have a good argument about their schooling costing more and inflation and salaries doing what they do, and can start not far from where an established clinician with a board specialty costs. The board specialty becomes a non-factor as a bargaining chip for salary and pay discussions. 

Has anybody had similar thoughts or experiences? Has anybody decided, for themselves, to recertify? Why? Has anybody here decided NOT to recertify? Why?

Any help and discussion as I mentally work through it would be so welcomed!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you all so much for your input on this. Seems like many of you have reached the same conclusion I’m feeling but not ready to fully accept yet. This is unfortunate, and more unfortunate that board specialties are still promoted like they are as a gateway to career advancement, increased pay, etc.

> **Response 2:** All these are namesake nomenclature with zero financial benefits.... if you are a employee or employer in our field of practice ... the bottom for reimbursement is license to practice... 
Any PT can be equally knowledgeable academically without getting this certificates and still treat patients.... 

All these certificate BS is created by our lovely APTA to make money for themselves and those CEU companies .... as I was taught All this manual certification courses at my university while pursuing my masters and it is listed on the course syllabus...

As they say Doctors "Practice".... and everyone knows "practice make man perfect".

🔥I just got a pelvic floor referral from a large OB/Gyn practice. The pressure is real! I need to do extremely well with this patient. 

After taking multiple pelvic rehab courses I’ve been unable to break into the pelvic health setting except for one patient who decided to give me a shot, and now they are my biggest cheerleader. This could be huge with helping me develop my skills as a provider and scaling my practice with this niche. 

I can’t believe I’m starting to reap the fruits of my labor.

What to do on personal trainers promoting “balance training” for people? I feel like that is not in their scope of practice. How would you all combat this? Their website is basically promoting physical therapy and saying they work with people who are “recovering from illnesses or injuries.”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As long as they are not stating that they treat illness its perfectly fine for them to do training balance etc. The difference is we treat they don't.

> **Response 2:** You guys would be surprised at what personal trainers are capable of. They have a lot less restrictions on them than we do. A lot of them are now receiving training on "corrective exercise", which overlaps greatly with what we do. As someone who consumes a lot of content on Instagram and YouTube from both physical therapists and personal trainers, I will tell you that there are some amazing personal trainers out there.

I've seen personal trainers provide exercises to help with balance. I do not feel that it is out of their scope. But to treat a diagnosed balance dysfunction is where the differences arise in our training . But guess what, they can do it anyway and no one can do anything about it.  

They can practice across state lines, they don't need a physician to sign a plan of care, they don't even need to worry about their state practice act because there is not one as far as I know. If I'm wrong correct me on this. 
And they can treat Medicare patients until the cows come home and charge whatever they want. PT on the other hand,  a totally different story.

I just want to get this off my chest about Medbridge. Since HEP2GO died I've been looking for a better HEP software.
I want to use Medbridge's HEP suite with all the bells and whistles that comes along with it because it seems to have all the features I want. BUT as a solo practice that only needs 1 license I can't just purchase the small business level of HEP services. I either have to purchase the "premium" 1 subscriber level for MORE MONEY with LESS features or purchase 2 HEP only subscriptions to get access to all the features I want at nearly the same cost as the "premium" subscription without any of the CEU opportunities. 
I'm trying to give Medbridge my money and it's like they don't want it. Rant over!

How do you all figure out times per exercise ? If I have 60 minutes with a patient and 3 -5 minutes goes towards getting subjective and objective info that leaves 55 minutes. Rest/ transition time not billable. How do you document and justify your units. Does anyone have a system they use to meet these time requirements.  Guessing how long it takes and actually timing give different results depending on the pace of the patient and I find this time consuming to get accurate. Would love to hear how others do this quickly and accurately, justified documentation.  Thanks. I’m really on top of myself for this and wonder if most therapists are ethical about this requirement and how I can learn to be quicker.  I find myself adding lots of justification to my documentation to cya and I’m a seasoned therapist.  I find this requirement very challenging. But I do it for every patient.  Even cash patients that won’t be audited because I care about being consistent.  There has to be a better way than I am using.  One patient might take 3 minutes to do 3 sets of 10 each leg and another might take 6-7 minutes. 🤷‍♂️. Would love to hear from you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For the record, I 100% think you are overdoing this.  I have never documented time per exercise.  I do document time per cpt code but never per exercise or rest break or any of that.  If you are spending one on one time with your client for an hour, all of that time is billable.  My note would look something like this:

97110 Therapeutic exercise (25 minutes) - strength and flexibility training to address deficits in XYZ strength and XYZ ROM

97530 Therapeutic Activity (20 minutes) - whole body activities to retrain balance, body mechanics, posture, and movement patterns during functional activities

97140 manual therapy (15 minutes) - MFR to XYZ and MET to XYZ to address pain and dysfunction 

And then below this description of my CPT codes I would list each exercise and/or activity performed. 

Therapeutic exercises and activities performed during this session: 

1.
2.
3.
Etc

This list would be thorough with reps etc but I would not list time per. 

Then in my assessment section I will document what cues were needed and response to exercise or improvements noted and challenges still present etc. 

I think documentation is already the worst part of the job and it sounds like you are making it a hundred times worse by forcing yourself to time these things. 

If I absolutely felt I had to place a time value on each exercise because insurance required it (Medicare does not and I don’t take other insurance so I haven’t seen that), I guess I would simply take my 25 minutes and arbitrarily break it up next to my list of exercises until it added up.  I wouldn’t even think about it.  I’d just say - let’s see there are 12 exercises here - 2 min each exercise and 3 min for one - done.  I would include “rest time/transition time” with the exercise - we are human not robots.   Pretty sure BCBS isn’t going to challenge your time.

> **Response 2:** Rest breaks are part of the exercise. You are not billing just for the time they are actively moving. Education is also billable. All that time is part of your treatment. If you're with them and providing care you should be billing.

Ortho PT’s:  any advice on retraining VMO after months of atrophy and MPFL 5 weeks ago?  I have provided an NMES unit for daily use/HEP per protocol but minimal progress.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t currently work in private practice but I have worked in D1 training rooms for quite some time, so this is actually very much my domain if you don’t mind me commenting here.

1) what e-stim machine are you using?AND What are the parameters you use using on the estim and what is the machine? Most portable machines (especially ones that can be purchased on Amazon) aren’t actually powerful enough to provide the kind of feedback to bounce back from true AMI after surgery unless meeting certain standards. Delaware produced a study not to long back looking at units and their ability to produce true motor recruitment. I have since switched to the Chattanooga portable unit (it’s about $400) and can be programmed for your patient and is a wonder!) I can forward this article. If you are using a non-portable Chattanooga device then try not using Russian estim setting, and instead trying utilizing symmetrical biphasic wavelength with 420+ phase duration and frequency of 55+ with cycle time of 10/50 for 15 mins. Still dial it up to reach borderline intolerable tetany. 

2) what are the size pads you are using? Wisconsin and a few other power 5s are utilizing 4x 8 inch pads and I got this tidbit about a year and half ago— I’ll never go back. For my smaller patients I’ll still never do smaller than 2x 4 inch pads. (Also noted in the Delaware study) the size of the pad allows you to recruit larger portions of all the muscles of the quadriceps and disperses the stim over a greater area allowing you to crank up the machine even higher and provide more electrical feedback. 

3) there is some recent research published as well on the utilization of ice specifically over the knee joint itself (basically just the patella and patellar and quad tendons and you can even put the same on the backside of knee joint) DO NOT GET ICE ON ANY SURROUNDING MUSCLE TISSUE (aka not on calves or quads) for about 10 mins immediately prior to activity. It shocks the joint proprioceptors to pay better attention to the joint motion and will decrease pain response which may be contributing to the AMI itself. 

I would try all of the above changes before ditching estim … anddd I would do all of this with quad sets so it’s not a difficult exercise when they are getting used to increased biofeedback/stimulation.(Estim should not be ditched before 80% LSI is achieved— which is much later in most rehabs than most people discontinue it— this is what OSU protocol indicates- there may even be an article I can find to support this)

Then…

4) TKE/SLR etc can all be cheated with muscles that work when you have AMI— I would switch to exercises that isolate (as much as possible the VMO) like SAQ AND ISO LAQ- although formerly believed to be taboo it’s extremely important to integrate E-stim with SAQ AND utilize E-stim with iso LAQ (belted at 60-90 deg— due to early precautions then progress) as quickly as possible in rehab (I have integrated it as early as 2 weeks post op given my patient is comfortable with 90deg flexión and min/no swelling)— estim with these two exercises specifically will help much more with the VMO (albeit the patient usually feels a bit uneasy about them— especially if it’s a quad tendon repair because they feel a bit of a tug)

your patient is 5 weeks post op so they should be able to tolerate both of these after changing parameters and pads with quad sets. The other commenters are right though MPFLs are much slower than an ACLR but you are right to be concerned. VMO activation should be back by week 6 at the very latest for probably good outcomes (not that it can’t happen… but it’s a longer bumpier road if not)

Happy to post the articles I referenced here (most of which are extrapolations from ACLR research) and I hope this helps!

**Original Post:**
Have a post op ACL patient I’ve been seeing. He’s about to be 5 weeks out.

In my mind he’s doing great. Were able to do blazepods for balance and hip strengthening. We do BFR for short arc quads, straight leg raise, and hip abduction in supine.

He definitely does a lot of exercises at home so I’m not sitting here doing all the basic heel slide/quad set exercises so we can focus on the big stuff that he can’t do at home.

He had his appointment with the surgeon yesterday and he was not happy at all and told the patient he may have some permanent limitations because his range of motion wasn’t 100% yet.

Patient is a big hypochondriac and is freaking out. So I tried reassuring him that according to our protocol we are doing fine and to not worry. And I told him at the start of 5 weeks we’d be doing a lot more such as leg press/mini squats and really start working on the knee itself as far as range of motion.

Any advice from anyone?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t assume what he heard is what was said. 

Trust your gut. 

Unless you are in the room at the follow up visit what he thinks he heard is likely only the voice in his head.

Any of y’all who do group exercise classes…how did you learn how to run them lol. Any advice welcome, any classes or CEUs I’m very interested in! I’m a PWR moves certified PT so I want to feel more comfortable structuring group exercise for people with Parkinson’s 🙌🏻

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Taking exercise classes yourself can give you ideas about structure, scaling, intensity, variety etc.  I participate in a small group strengthening program myself and now run three groups for 55+. I add more agility, balance and scaling options with my PT experience.
I also follow the Modern Management of the Older Adult section of ICE. They have great social media, podcast and cont ed content.

> **Response 2:** I’ve done a couple courses from varying sources from the type of class I want to lead. (In the process of putting together a business plan.) What I find challenging is the variety of abilities that I’m *hoping* will show up to class and making it fun but challenging for everyone from an athlete to couch potato to wheelchair user. Because the group exercise classes I’ve taken more structured around splitting up ability levels which 1) doesn’t work for chronic conditions like PD and the other Neuro dx I enjoy working with whose abilities can change on the daily and 2) that rubs my DEI(inclusion) training the wrong way. So not sure how that will go until I dive in, but hoping my PT brain will serve there 😅

As others have mentioned, every course I’ve taken recommends making an outline to follow. So maybe I’ll just flesh out the outline with options to increase and decrease the intensity.

**Community Responses:**

As far as an HEP program, it depends on what you want to provide, and who your audience is.  If it is a tech savvy audience, I love SWITCHBACK HEALTH.  I can generate my own pics or videos on the spot (or at home) and email them to the client.
The client downloads the app (free for them) where everything goes. So, now, when they want to see their exercises, the exercises can all be found in one location.   
You also have the ability to see if the client is actually going to their exercise “folder”

> **Response 2:** I use Medbridge it is good for HEP and for Con Ed

Hey guyys, i've seen some people talk about this, but honestly I don't know how I feel about it. I have a PT I work with that's COMT certified and his treatment methods are very different to McKenzie methods. Ive seen  posts where is has  been mostly COMT PT's bashing MDT PT's but honestly I'm trying to see where they find Maitland methods to be better.
A lot of the good McKenzie therapists, does not see this as "everyone does extension, they get better." They see it as a diagnostic tool. There has been several patients in my career that have been not extension responders but have been even
flexion or rotational movements. We over flex as a society given that functional activities are in some form of flexion mostly. That's why I think most people respond best to extension because we over flex which cause changes in the spine/discs.
For those who have had both Mckenzie training and Maitland training what do you feel is a more ideal method to diagnose and treat patients?
Also, do you find one method or the other to be better for different pathologies?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No one should be bashing any one style. The reality is, they all help for the right patients. Some patients will respond better to Maitland, others to Mckenzie, others to [insert other style]. Your job as a PT is to have as many tools in the toolbox as possible so that when you come across a patient, you can not only fit them into the right style but the right technique in that style. Not everyone is a Mckenzie patient. And that's ok. I do a lot of counterstrain- and not everyone is a counterstrain patient, and that's ok.

> **Response 2:** I’m Maitland certified and I think it’s appalling that any PT is bashing another technique.  
I think the best PTs are the ones with lots of varying tools available to them.
At its core, Maitland is an assessment approach (not a treatment technique).  The accessory mobility assessment does often lead to treatment (ie. Mobilizations) but in actuality I find the treatment often aligns with preferential directional treatment (which I believe falls under the McKenzie theories).

I’m not McKenzie trained, but I have worked with McKenzie therapists… and I think the two approaches actually blend quite well together.

Hello! I just finished a PhD in Health Sciences, Human and Sport Performance. I am practicing as an LMT but also have CSCS. 

Right now I’m a mobile massage therapist as I gain clientele. I specialize in Thai massage on the mat, clinical sports massage, and lymphatic drainage massage. 

I have extensive training in teaching mindfulness and meditation. Hoping to add small group classes when I find the perfect studio space.

I’m also approved as a CE provider for LMTs… 3 different categories: Business, Ethics, and Perinatal

I’m just beginning to navigate the waters of what a business could look like for myself. I’m finally released from the demands of the dissertation! I feel so free. I’m open to any suggestions you may have! We live in South Carolina

**Community Responses:**

If I were you, I’d reach out to cancer centers who can refer people with lymphedema, as well as plastic surgery centers who may have clients that could use this type of massage to release fluid after surgery (e.g., tummy tuck, liposuction, etc). Good luck!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Multiple structures are often injured with a lateral meniscus injury and when repaired the meniscus is repaired but the other elements of the arcuate complex are rarely addressed.  This fixates abnormal
Mobility of the meniscus but neglects the other structures that MRI doesn’t pick up.  

In my office I’d check multiple angles of varus laxity (involved vs. uninvolved), tib fib motion as well as ankle mobility (tib fib mobility is exaggerated with ankle lateral instability) and appreciate under US the other stabilizing elements of the lateral complex bilaterally.

If you have a shockwave system it can help scar the capsules and components of the lax ligaments. Electrical dry needle placement on affected ligaments can help decrease laxity, but you’d have to place it on both ends of the affected tissue with the anode/cathode, and the needle placement needs to be precise.

> **Response 2:** Mri and X-ray negative when not swollen..6’6”. 180 lb..basketball player
No known trauma
History of lateral meniscus surgery one year ago..this was a symptom before surgery…no change after surgery 
HSS ortho has no diagnosis…just sent the picture to him

How often are your patients having adverse reactions to dry needling?  I try to warn them that they may be sore for 1-2 days following our session but I feel like with upper traps specifically, my patients often have an increase in their pain for a few days.  Is there something I’m missing with upper trap techniques for dry needling specifically?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Describe your treatment approach - not enough information for anyone to accurately answer. 

I first learned dry needling from a more aggressive, piston-until-it-stops-twitching, treatment philosophy. I was so excited to use it in clinic the following Monday, and on the first patient I could - a pretty irritable glute tendinopathy. They did come back for a second session, thankfully, but asked that I never dry needle them again!

What I’ve found over the years is that certain body parts are more sensitive to it, that certain people are more sensitive to it, that I had eventually gravitated to “piston less, stim more” before Paul Killoren coined it as a phrase, and that we always need to appreciate the symptom irritability of the patient before us.

I would treat that “first patient” so much differently now than I had that day.

> **Response 2:** Soreness after needling for 24-48 hours isn’t uncommon but it shouldn’t be excessive, otherwise it’s an indicator that your techniques were likely too aggressive. 

The upper traps have an emergent point and motor point in the same ballpark so they tend to get extra ‘twitchy’ - those local twitch responses from pistoning can definitely make someone pretty sore and achey, so have to feel out your clientele to judge whether or not you think they can handle it (and if it’s even appropriate)

**Community Responses:**

Don’t make the mistake of charging al a carte for those services though. Just charge what you would charge for an hour and include what you think the patient needs

> **Response 2:** Manual therapy and educating at length about just about anything, and listening to them talk for more than 30 seconds when they arrive.

The manual and Therex is great but it really just serves as theatrics until the body figures it out. 

I find that once my patients understand the reality that it isn’t dangerous and they should stop or avoid doing things, they tend to embrace the “it is what it is” attitude and do pretty well. 

I explain how exercise may acutely benefit the chemical environment, so it doesn’t matter what you do as long as you do something and do it frequently.

What is your favorite patient rejection reason of the year?

Got my first "They don't want you back" rejection of 2024 (that I know of). The patient had hip surgery and is coming home. The daughter told my friend that "My PTA and I talked too much and didn't do enough work." 

Umm, that's because we were trying to talk them into doing the basics that would prevent them from needing surgery in the first place.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a notoriously difficult pt (OP sports) who really wanted her problem to be that she was tight rather than weak 🤷‍♀️ She resisted strengthening even though she really wanted to get back to tennis, so I tried to blend some stretching with a lot of education and gradual increase on the strengthening exercises. Eventually she came in and said:

"This isn't working. I don't come in here for YOUR EMPATHY."

🤯😂

Ok, pal. You go on with your bad self. Wish you all the luck in the world.

> **Response 2:** Unpopular opinion...
Perception is reality is tough to hear. Even if you are right, it didn't come across to the client in a way they could, or were willing to understand.  It's our choice if we want to Self improve so we can reach those difficult ones, or just stick to the easy ones. 
Sometimes,  it just won't work, and that's OK too. But after 32 years of practicing,  most of the time I can get my message across and they can benefit.  If not, refer out to someone else they may "hear" better from.

I recall it being a pretty big time commitment for her and she had to go travel for a few weekends as part of her certification for the practical portion.

I don't know if this helps much but there is a PT on IG Jill Koshak Johnson who has great content.  She really speaks to the perimenopausal and menopausal female population but you can apply a lot of principles to everyone.
I did reach out to her to ask about her certification she is Power Pilates trained, said they are more old school/classical pilates. She said Stott is also pretty popular but there are many options out there.

One of the best courses I have taken is by APPI Pilates. It was geared toward Health Care practitioners and took 12 or 15 of the most basic Pilates moves and showed you how to modify them for a lower level population.  

Hope that helps a bit!

> **Response 2:** For personal preference reasons, I am not overjoyed about it, but I am in the process of becoming Polestar certified, and I have to say if you're interested in Pilates for rehab, Polestar is the way to do it. Let me know if you've got questions.

Hi group, long time follower, First time poster. I am contemplating starting up a mobile practice and maybe add a brick and mortar spot if the business justifies it. I currently work home heath 3 days a week and 2 Saturdays a month in acute but also have peds and outpatient experience. I am saddened on the push to DC people so soon from home health and now the census had been very low. I enjoy working with the older adult group especially those with PD and dementia as well as those who are generally weak. I'd like to keep it cash pay/private pay to avoid  insurance altogether. 

My questions are: The older adult population is heavy Medicare so can you even offer cash services for physical therapy or does it have to be marketed as wellness? 

What are good software programs to use for documenting as well as for accounting purposes? 

How do I go about marketing myself initially to the community? 

Thank you all for reading this far.😊

Picture for a chuckle 😆

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi, geriatrics are my niche and I am only cash based.  I don't find it very difficult to brand what I am doing as wellness with this population bc most of my people really want a consistent exercise program that doesn't change alot,  and they also don't progress quickly,  if at all. Medicare would never pay me for what I do with them bc we aren't working toward specific, measurable goals, and I don't modify treatment plans very often. I have a few people who are more acute and have goals but they are usually seeing another therapist under Medicare during that acute period too,  so I am the uncovered service again.  I just use Google docs for barebones documentation bc no one is ever going to ask for it 😆

> **Response 2:** Too funny, home health is my main gig too. And I cringe when they say walk right in.... always feel like a burglar 🤣

Had a concierge doc call me today to go do an evaluation for someone getting outpatient PT, but wants more at her home. She also wants me to do a home assessment for her. Used ChatGPT to give me an Ada compliant form so I would know what to check and make a form to fill out for fall assessment so I can give it to her. Going to find a local handyman to refer to if she needs home modifications.  This is something I have been thinking about doing, but no promoting it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jeremy Sutton let me know if you need our Home Modifications/Environmental Assessment form. I will email it to you.

> **Response 2:** That's fantastic that you're looking to support your patient with a home assessment! Ensuring safety at home is so important for promoting independence and reducing fall risks.

As an OT who specializes in conducting comprehensive home evaluations and recommending personalized modifications. Our training focuses on how individuals interact with their environment during daily activities, considering both physical and cognitive aspects.

There's substantial evidence supporting OT-led home modifications in improving patient outcomes. Collaborating with an OT could enhance the support you're providing and ensure your patient receives the most effective care.

Hi, I am not currently working as a PT (focusing on growing my mountain bike coaching business with a side of strength and conditioning.) I'm worried about CON ED and maintaining my PT license- what do y'all suggest I do to make sure I am keeping up with the requirements? I do have a Medbridge subscription and was going to try to find some courses related to athletes. Any other ideas?  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HIGHLY RECOMMEND Joe's course!!!! It won't be a waste of time for you like other CEUs would be

> **Response 2:** How many hours do I need and in which categories? Having a hard time finding this on the APTA CO website- I need 20 hours from educational coursework- so this can be 20 CEUs from something like Medbridge or Summit?  Then what about the other 10 hours? If I remember correctly, we also need an ethics course? CPR counts for a certain number of CEUs?  Thanks, never had to worry about this before when I worked in corporate clinics and was working towards a certification as well as mentoring students.

**Original Post:**
Hi everyone, I could really use some advice and perspective from this amazing group.

I’ve been feeling a bit stuck lately—my schedule recently went from fully booked to a little quiet, and it’s starting to impact my mindset. Some of the change is positive—several patients progressed faster than expected and were discharged early (which is great!), but I also think summer schedules and vacations are playing a role.

New patients are trickling in, but many are opting for visits spaced a week or more apart due to financial reasons. While I completely understand and respect that, it’s been tough from a business standpoint. I find myself spending even more time outside of sessions—checking in, following up, and prepping between visits—and it’s starting to feel draining (not burnout, but close).

I’m slowly getting into social media, but it’s very time-consuming and I’m not sure I’ve found my rhythm yet. My niche is pelvic health and chronic pain across the lifespan, mostly serving women, and while my patients are committed, their own full plates with work, family, and other medical appointments make scheduling consistent care tricky. We’ve started offering some telehealth sessions, which helps, but overall, the dip is weighing on me.

This is the first real slump I’ve experienced since opening. Friends and colleagues keep suggesting I contract with insurance for the short-term, then phase it out after growing my client base—but that route feels overwhelming and not aligned with how I want to work.

Has anyone else navigated a slow season like this in a cash-based or hybrid pelvic health practice? What helped you stay afloat and continue growing while staying true to your values and energy? I truly love the work I do, and my patients are getting great results—it’s just the business side that feels heavy right now.

Appreciate any ideas, support, or even just solidarity 💛

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Been uncaged 20 years.  Spring of 24' my scheduled dried up for a month or so.  Ebbs and flows of a new post covid environment.  Since u r uncaged, taking insurance will not change how u practice, but will change your reimbursement rate.  We took most when we opened, only take 2 now.

> **Response 2:** I have a similar practice. I’m a pelvic therapist and I do Dry Needling. I don’t take any insurance except for Medicare. I’m in Florida so summer definitely slows down seasonally. But I take advantage of it and take Fridays off in the summer. But if you have a cash based element to practice, you definitely have got to be engaged in social media on the regular. You have to have a foundation set up and then get yourself established in organic conversations through different Facebook groups that focus on your population. I have found this to be Very very helpful. I would strongly suggest against going with insurance. If you really feel like you need something temporary contract with a home health agency and do a little home health on the side. Also consider connecting with a home health agency and offering to do a Pelvic Floor program for them. Just a basic bladder training program nothing crazy because I don’t do internals in the home with the elderly. But teaching basic bladder health and having a program focused on incontinence in the elderly is fairly simple and straightforward, and it can be a good way to diverse by your practice and show up your schedule in times like this.   ￼ also also connect with local outpatient physical therapist helped them identify your patient population to refer to you. I get a lot of referrals from massage therapist Chiropracter‘s other physical therapist. They’re a great source of referrals. Also look for a business women’s networking group local. The one I belong to is very supportive about referring patients and it’s also been a great resource of patience ￼￼

**Original Post:**
I want to feel out the Uncaged community on a business idea I have. I am a physical therapist and have 16 years experience, with the last 11.5 years being in home health with a mostly geriatric population. In my work with senior patients, I find that most of them won’t keep up with their exercise routine after I discharge. I get it. It’s really hard to start and stick with an exercise routine when no one is holding you accountable. But when they don’t keep up their exercises, they usually lose the progress they made with me and end up weaker, often falling and breaking something, at which point they’re referred back for therapy again and we start back at square one (or even further back). I wish insurance companies would pay for regular, ongoing therapy visits to prevent this kind of decline, but the reality is that they just don’t. The patients I treat are homebound, so going to an outpatient clinic usually isn’t an option. Mobile therapy options that bill as outpatient are also limited (my sister actually had her own practice doing this but recently moved out of state, and I have no desire to deal with the insurance headache that she had to, all for minimal reimbursement).

So here is my idea. To have a business that offers only wellness visits to seniors. No skilled physical therapy service, which means it is not billed to insurance and does not require a plan of care. It would be private pay only with visits as often as the client wants. Almost like having a personal trainer come to the home but with the knowledge and training of a physical therapist. The goal would be to assist clients in performing their home exercises and establishing an overall wellness routine, while also being able to monitor patients for red flags that their doctor may need to know about (like signs of infection, high blood pressure, low oxygen, etc) in order to prevent avoidable hospitalizations. Does anyone here have a practice like this? Is this a service you think you, your parents, or your grandparents would use? I have such a passion for helping the senior community to improve their health and prevent (or at least slow down) any avoidable decline, so I’m brainstorming ways I can make that happen. ☺️ (I know this was long…thanks for reading!)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am doing this now.  I’m a certified personal trainer as well as a physical therapist. There is a huge need when I discharge people from Home Health physical therapy to continue with the wellness program. This works great.  I do carry malpractice insurance on my business. I also make them sign a consent form stating that they are receiving Personal Training and not Physical THERAPY in order to cover myself.  Another thing I do is work with Luna, which is a company owned by a physical therapist who does all the backend billing. Once the patient is discharged from Home Health I picked them up as an outpatient physical therapy. The company does all the insurance billing authorization and calling the doctors. Once that’s completed I offer wellness packages.  ￼

> **Response 2:** One thought I had about marketing would be to take this to the local ALF’s/ILF’s. There are several in my area. Yeah those places may have daily exercise classes, but in my experience, not many residents take advantage of those classes. Partly due to laziness (don’t want to leave their room) or partly due to not wanting others to see them doing exercises in case they can’t keep up. Others just aren’t motivated at all, which would likely translate to not being motivated to take what I can offer either, in which case they’re not my target client.

Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for the interest and DM's
I will answer each inquiry as soon as I can but I'm taking a weekend seminar so please be patient with me.
Thank you again !!!!

Please delete if not allowed.
I'm closing my pelvic and lymphedema clinic in firt pierce Florida because we are moving to another state.. I'm selling all my equipment 
Prometheus semg biofeedback with sidtware
Real time ultrasound imaging with software
Prometheus Mr 10 stim unit 
High low table
Emsella kegel chair
Pilates Cadillac table abd springs
Call me if you have questions 772 3427559

PS I still don't know where I'm moving too. My husband just retired from the fire department and wants to move to a cooler state. I want to move somewhere that's nice for raising a 10 yr old, and work at a happy pelvic clinic and not a corporate PT mill. Anybody want to hire me?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always got emotional when i saw bad comments on the chair online but i use it everyday and it works.  Before i got the chair my patients were getting better. But i wanted faster results so patients get better in half the time wuth the chair. I still do everything biofeddback, manual therapy, pilates etc,  but i honestly love my emsella chair.
It has the standard protocols on it but I put a new one that I made and it works like a charm . I can teach you. Pelvic PTs hate the chair but when used properly it's a game changer. Medi spas just put the patient on the chair they don't look for episiotomy scars, hypertonic muscles, constipation, pelvic pain  spasm like we do. I always balance hip and pelvic floor muscles strength, coordination and flexibility. If you do that the emsella is wonderful.

> **Response 2:** Since you are from Florida like me, you’re used to not paying a state income tax. It’s a big shock when you move to a state that does have it. Look at Tennessee, it’s beautiful, mountains and no income tax. ￼

I launched my cash-practice 11 weeks ago!!

I am practicing out of a sports performance gym and treating athletes/active individuals. I am working the kinks out and optimizing systems… the joys of business ownership lol. 

My question is, in relation to direct access/legalities/ethics what am I missing when it comes to true “PT POC” vs wellness programming and treatments? Practicing in Louisiana (for reference) Direct Access laws are very open and direct. 

I’m in an environment where clients have issues but not really injuries. So, trying to figure out the optimal way to create a treatment plan/program to meet their needs and my bottom line. ANY thoughts would be more than helpful. Love this group of people, thank you in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m five years into my cash based practice in TN, and despite my best efforts, I cannot find a clear answer to this question. There’s so much gray. Clearly, a post-op pt is a PT client. But, someone who’s having shld/back/knee stiffness, etc could fall into both the PT category and the wellness category. One thing I was well advised about is pricing. I suggest charging the same rate for PT as for Wellness…BECAUSE your long term wellness clients will likely need PT at some point and it’s too confusing (for both the patients and the business) to charge different rates for the same patient. I’m interested to see other comments here.

> **Response 2:** Cash based OT with mostly manual therapy skills/ortho/sports etc. 

How I approach wellness: 
Anything that needs more than AROM, MMT or orthopedic assessments for the evaluation I would consider skilled, for me. 
If I can do a rapid assessments and determine the cause of the problem through the three things mentioned above then I don’t consider it skilled, as a LMT could also do those things. 

How I approach skilled: 
usually this is a lot easier. People will come directly from the Dr or surgeon with a plan already in place. A diagnosis, recommendations, etc. Typically the more in depth standardized evals that will take an extended amount of time to perform and interpret are my signs that it is surely skilled. 

How I avoid the grey:
I just have everyone get a Drs referral. This helps the grey area and they can also deduct from their taxes as a business expense. So it’s a win win.

Okay all you mountain rehab/snow niche peeps. Texan here who went skiing for the first time. I’m looking for targeted exercises to help me next year LOL!! My hips and glutes were just screaming after the first full day. Plyometrics, hill work, core, standard resistance training for BLEs? Anything else? Would love to hurt less next year, and to help out my poor family members who needed more than my yoga and flexibility skill set 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** In addition to the above, I love doing wall seats timed for a very long time, since you're working on a lot of muscular endurance as well and holding that contraction just like when you are skiing down the mountain.

Skaters are awesome also for more explosive mvmt

🐴🐴Anyone work with horseback riders? 

I’m doing a presentation tomorrow at a riding arena for a group of riders talking about overall strengthening, mobility, stretching programs to make them better riders. 

I have a couple of riders I work with and have some ideas but if anyone has any go to resources or really cool mobility/stretching/strengthening exercises they use let me know. 

Thanks and have a great day. !!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been riding in the hunter and jumpers for 40 years. Hip mobility and muscle imbalance is a common problem especially right worse than left since most riders mount from the left side. 
Concussions are also a common problem

> **Response 2:** Check out Shea Competitive Edge on Instagram. He’s not in this group but his exercise ideas and reels are awesome!

Drop your favorite and most useful physical therapy continuing education courses, seminars, etc you’ve taken (outpatient ortho, sports med, and/or pelvic floor related).

I’m already certified in advanced dry needling, ASTYM, and have done some upledger craniosacral courses.

**Community Responses:**

Has anyone taken any online courses from Institute of Clinical Excellence? I’m considering taking a course for CEUs and don’t want to waste my time if you didn’t feel like it helped your clinical knowledge. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just took the Clincal Management of the Fitness Athlete foundations course and I thought it was really insightful. Each week featured: a lecture video with some drills, a weekly homework assignment, a zoom meeting to breakdown some videos submitted for homework and Q&A. The instructors are clinic owners that still treat patients and coach CrossFit  and are active fitness athletes themselves. Bonus you get lifetime access to the material so you can always refer back.

> **Response 2:** I havent, but if its CEUs and strength training youre looking for, I can vouch for my course, the 6 week Clinical Coach Challenge, which affords 30 CEUs and is within the same niche as ICE's courses :)

Where is your focus?

Wait. What?

Sunday, I was helping my daughter with her tennis. She simply wants to be able to hit with her friends who are better.

I finally realized that I was giving her the same feedback that I’ve given to many many others who were looking to improve their game, which was “YES!” when the STROKE was desirable.

Not if the ball went in, or it was an amazing shot.

I told her that she probably wondered why I seemed excited on shots that, in her head, weren’t good shots.

I mean, some balls even went over the SIDE fence.

I said here’s why:

If you want to improve faster, you’re going to do so by understanding what you are doing right rather than worrying about what the outcome looks like.

In other words, get the process down, strengthen your foundations, and you will get a lot more right, hit a lot more good shots.

So, where is YOUR focus?

Is it “I can’t get people to say Yes” - outcome focused

Or…

Is it learning an effective process that helps people to understand with clarity how you can help them- principle focused.

Something to think about …

Does or has anyone seen a patient 2x a week for maintenance? Let’s say neuro conditions a like MS or Parkinson’s

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes but you need to have strong documentation for objective measures and impact on quality of life. You also need to vary your frequency to show the patient declines in quality of life and function with less therapy.

> **Response 2:** I have done this with 2 Medicare patients in the past. It took a lot of documentation and coordination with their provider to sign off on it when needed. The one was younger and was on disability his whole life due to a rare neuro disorder. We had years of history of him doing regular PT, discharging, declining and returning to PT. He did so well with the maintenance program! He was able to start working and eventually took a full time job that was flexible with him and he was able to get off Medicare disability! Last I heard he was still working and loving it. I was so proud of him.

I am curious about diagnostic msk ultrasound and specifically using it with dry needling. I would love if anyone has gone this route that I could talk to? 
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Caleb Walls!

> **Response 2:** Spinal Manipulation Institute (AAMT) has the DN-3 class which is specifically tailored to exactly what you are stating you want to know more about. Not only could you get some CEU’s, but the course is invaluable to clinicians and patients. I use MSK US daily, especially for US guided needling for tendinosis, fasciosis, etc and the patients typically are delighted that the specific symptoms they have are precisely reproduced during intervention, and that the root of their problem has been found. James Escaloni (who commented above) above has taught me most of what I know about MSK US and may arguably be one of the best in the world at what he does.

Hey all. I have a severe thoracic outlet case who is awaiting thoracic surgeon appointment. Long hx of pain and has been in and out of PT for 2 years with some relief but nothing long lasting. It appears to be true vascular compression. I am trying to alleviate some of her symptoms leading up to the appointment. Are there any unique go to techniques you all have found helpful in these cases? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Muscle energy technique and even SCS have powerful techniques for  TOS..

> **Response 2:** Check for hypermobility at the shoulder as well. My best friend from PT school had an unrelenting case of thoracic outlet and also scores a 7-8 on the Beighton scale (I forget her exact score). Whenever she would carry things, the traction on her shoulder was contributing significantly to her TOS. She was able to largely resolve her symptoms with a lot of work on shoulder stabilization. She also did a lot of work to improve her awareness so she could rely more on active vs passive support of the shoulder, especially with lifting/carrying.

Looking for some billing advice.... 

I currently work at a hospital based outpatient clinic. I usually feel that their ethics are good, but I’ve recently started dry needling and was educated to bill it as manual therapy. I don’t feel comfortable with this, but they haven’t been willing to set up a cash pay system for dry needling. Do I continue to dry needle and not bill for it? Or just tell them I will no longer be providing dry needling services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The answer is actually really simple. The Insurnace companies tell you. I can’t answer for you as it depends on where you are but all Insurnace companies very specifically tell you what to bill and if covered In their medical guidelines. Just a quick google search…. Hope that helps

> **Response 2:** I'm not sure why you feel it isn't manual therapy? 
Imo, with PT services, our time should be reimbursed the maximum amount, because it shouldn't matter what we choose to do in our tx session; it should all be up to us. Why would we not get the best reimbursement for our time?

Hello! I was wondering what the top notch weight lifting certification programs are? Preferably one non biased to thick thighs 😂

In undergrad I would beat most classmates in the 1 and 2 mile races we had, placing third in female/male races. I beat everyone in the class in the blindfolded balance board exercises. We had university BB players, lacrosse players and football players in that class. And I lasted longer running while having VO2max tested. That was great because it smashed misconceptions about big girls and the re-defined what “fit” or “athletic” means. I have a couple weight lifting courses I’m looking at but they seem very generic. Any and all advice appreciated 🏋️‍♀️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would go for the CFMA Cert from ICE. It will cover the Olympic lifts plus a lot more and be much more applicable across the board for many types of fitness athletes. This is coming from someone with an Olympic Weightlifting background and the USAW level 1. Unless you only want to work with Weightlifters, but they will likely look for someone who has weightlifting experience before coming to you to be honest.

> **Response 2:** Another vote for the ICE CMFA certification, I'm so glad I did that over USAW to get started. It changed my lifts immediately in the gym and also gave awesome groundwork to start treating active people that love/need to lift. Also great crew of people to get involved with in general!

I saw the recent post about a CEU course for ANF therapy, and after looking into it I have to be 💯honest in that my BS meter went off the hook, and I consider myself pretty open to some of the more nebulous treatment ideas and approaches. 🤷🏻‍♂️  My question to the group is what all has been your experience with it? Is it worth it? Are there other companies beside the one mentioned that offer products where you don’t need to do thousands of $ in trainings to become licensed? I’m genuinely curious, and feel free to message me directly if you don’t want to offend anyone!😂 Link to the company referenced is below.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I practice it with every single private client and I’ve consistently gotten better outcomes 2-3 times faster compared to without it (I also work insurance based part time and I’ve tracked similar cases). There are results that still shock me to this day after using it for 3 years in ways that I can’t explain as just placebo—like Kevin DeGroot mentioned too. 

Pain relief, restored motion and function in the first session, far quicker recovery time than with my manual therapy skill set + standard PT (and I also get good results already with manual techniques and pain neuroscience education, etc). 

I’ve used it on my competitive athletes and those with chronic pain and comorbidities when “nothing else is working” and both groups and those in between have been blown away by how fast and lasting this stuff is. 

It’s great because even on that initial treatment, my clients walk out the door with an average of 40-50% improvement on symptoms and restoration of activity progresses more consistently. 

I had a rancher with a ruptured biceps who couldn’t even put on his shirt or flex his arm above 60 degrees with chronic shoulder pain and within the same visit we got him to 160 flexion and putting his jacket back on pain free and then four weeks later he was roping cattle again. 

I’ve also had a lymphedema protocol on a swollen leg experience like Kevin mentioned and watching it “deflate” as the swelling left in real time…both the client and my faces were 😮😮

Had a lady with sciatica and none of the traditional PT strengthening, stretching, or manual was helping her, but when I treated with her a gut protocol, and nothing on her sciatic nerve or associated hip muscles, her pain halved just as is. 

If you’re into whole-organism treatment, once you start learning and practicing with ANF, you see how everyone’s nervous system needs to be treated—much like how we can’t turn off our gait analysis eyes. 😆

Scenario 17yr suffered a Stroke/basil artery ischemia and Acute rehab TIRR Houston Tx saying she is medically stable to be released in a week & needs to be set up for OP rehab. Her home is west of FT Worth 45 miles in rural town Where would you go???? 

I’m trying to help this dear family, they are lost & TIRR doesn’t know our area for referral. 
She needs extensive therapy still non verbal & min movement in extremities but cognitively there.  
Any help would be appreciated. 🙏🙏🙏🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** “Rehab without walls” is neuro home health and they are excellent, sometimes can start there first then get her to outpatient.

> **Response 2:** Baylor day neuro, cns, pate. Whatever her insurance will cover for intensive therapy!! Also check rehab without walls and collage. That’s intensive home health. Much more than your average home health and it’s all neuro based!! 

With all of these you would get ot/pt/st, social work, neuropsych.

Kash Mahdi and wife, Jen also KICKED IT UP A NOTCH!!  They brought little Mikaela Quinn into the world!! 🥳🎉

One way to establish Famousity is to get on tv.  That is exactly what Kitiboni Physio did this week!  She appeared on a local morning tv show!!  BOOM SHAKALAKA!! 🕺

Another way to kick things up is to finish first place in age group in a triathlon.  That is exactly what Jennifer Reed and her sisters did at Ballast Point: Little Italy (San Diego)!! WAY TO GO!!🥇

Kristine Everett and *former* boyfriend, Justin, took things next level.  They got engaged!!! CONGRATS!!! 🎉🎉🎉

**Original Post:**
I'm treating a husband and wife at their home.  I have a mobile/cash PT practice.  The husband has psoriatic arthritis, is a fall risk, has some mental illness and PTSD.  At evaluation, he was upfront about his alcohol and cocaine use.  He says he's allergic to narcotics and breaks out in a rash so he is managing his pain the only way he knows how.  

He has no showed 3 times now because he was too ill to do his session.  Today, his wife went to get him for his appointment and she came back saying he wanted to cancel today and he was using cocaine in his bedroom.  

Husband and wife live pretty separate lives and may become legally separated soon.  I want to help, but I left today feeling a little uneasy.  I'm worried that he's unstable and unpredictable and could be impaired during our sessions and I want to make sure I'm safe.

I've never come across this situation before, and I'm not one to give up on people.  Any advice for me?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would say PT probably is not his most urgent need. I would advise another service to treat his mental health and addiction first and return to PT if he is able to adhere to some treatment. For me it does not sound like you will achieve much with PT alone at this stage. Perhaps he needs a multidisciplinary organization.

> **Response 2:** I’d say cut your losses. It sounds like he values his time significantly more than yours. I can almost guarantee nothing will change and most likely get worse.

**Original Post:**
Hi friends. I’m wondering if anyone has an infographic or something comparing chiropractic education (particularly in musculoskeletal and orthopedics) vs DPT education.  I want to create a community educational post saying something along the lines of “PTs are at least as qualified as chiros to treat musculoskeletal issues, so try coming to us first”, but I don’t want to create beef with local chiros. 

I’m just really tired of every single suggestion to every single community group post about anything body related being “go to the chiropractor!”  I do comment that there are other options, but I’d like to create an actual image or content post. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Make the comparison about the patient, not the practitioners..

What are the patients’ common pain points with chiros?

-The endless cycle of adjustment when that’s all they do: “I feel great after I got adjusted but a couple days later the pain always returns and I’m right where I started” 

-Signing up for some six month plan of 2-3x 
per week for $3,000

-Fear mongering by X-ray..”They took an X-ray of my back and told me how this little curve in my spine is causing me pain and if I don’t act now and sign up for six months my spine will continue to deteriorate.” 

If you can speak to these pain points and offer solutions (like how you can offer long term solutions that don’t involve signing your life away for six months; and how you help the patient build self care skills; and you’re not gonna take an X-ray just to tell people how crippled they are). I think that’s a better way to go. 

And you’re not even naming a profession by name; you’re just speaking to the frustrations that many people experience with the way certain practitioners work and saying you have an alternative and more enduring way that improves upon their pain points. 

Also, comparing “physical therapy” by name with chiro might fail too because lots of people have the experience of “I went to PT and they just gave me a sheet of core exercises that I could look up online and did nothing for my pain, but when I went to the chiropractor I felt amazing when I got off the table” 

Also, if we play the education comparison game, MD’s have us all beat, even though their expertise is mainly in MSK pathology and invasive procedures, but in MSK function we’re the subject matter experts

> **Response 2:** I dont believe this is true about you but it sounds too "inferiority complex-y" to me. I 100% agree and even believe a highly trained PT is better but I wouldn't compare. Just talk about what you can do, what you treat etc...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sadly, the only real answer is if 100% of all private practices refuse to accept UHC. This will force there members into large institutional healthcare businesses that will give them the worse experience imaginable.

I hope it's ok to ask this. I have EDS, pelvic congestion syndrome and likely endometriosis.  Can a women's health PT do much for these conditions, specifically PCS? My OB gyn basically dismissed me, so I am hoping to learn about other treatment options.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes- find a PT who is either a pelvic floor specialist and is familiar with EDS or a PT EDS specialist who is familiar with pelvic floor. What state are you in?

> **Response 2:** I’m not sure what part of MD you are in but go see To the Core PT in Towson! They are the best! Have Carrie evaluate! So so knowledgeable!

Looking for MSK diagnostic ultrasound courses.  Is AAMT good to go through?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve taken the first two courses and feel so enlightened—AAMT is truly amazing! I earned a Fellowship and a Diploma in Osteopractic through them, and I’m now working toward the MSK Ultrasound Fellowship. Every course I’ve taken has been phenomenal, and the instructors are not only highly knowledgeable but also gifted teachers. They present complex material in a way that’s easy to understand and immediately applicable. I find myself learning new skills over the weekend and confidently applying them in clinic on Monday. I highly recommend AAMT to any clinician looking to elevate their practice!  Feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions. I’d be happy to help.

Hey Vestibular PTs! How often do you perform on Epley on a pt with posterior canal BPPV? I’m asking for myself- had my first episode with it and am treating myself. Not something I generally treat, so any advice is appreciated. The first time did correct the nystagmus and I repeated it twice that day. But I am still lightheaded and slightly dizzy the next day. Thank you!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go check out my TikTok page on this topic @thedizzypt_amy.  I have a playlist on BPPV.  It's made for patients but will tell you a lot and answer a bunch of questions

> **Response 2:** I’ve had success with 3-4 repetitions of the Epley at a time in one or two treatment sessions, a few days to a week apart. Try to avoid laying flat or looking up/down or bending over for 24 hrs after the treatment.

Any of my mobile PTs have neck pain from looking down at patients feet all day long? Constantly looking down while patients walk, do step ups, balance, etc. Am I the only one?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Had severe neck pain in my 20’s/30’ while working all day in clinic and doing paperwork at counters…no more issues at 47 since  beginning McKenzie exercises (progress to chin tuck with ext),  daily foam roll routine for thoracic mobility, and pec MINOR stretching.  Must gain extension and mobility at CT junction, and start out working on this every 2 hours (don’t just wait til you get home at the end of the day).  Hope you feel better!

> **Response 2:** When I was first in Pilates training (before PT school), the teacher trainer encouraged us to “look with your eyes, not your head” because we could develop neck pain fully looking down on mats and reformers all day long. That stuck with me, along with the expectation that I should have proper posture if I was to preach it all day. Lying on a foam roller before bed also does wonders.

Has anyone ever asked to be at a PT/trainer at a school for athletes to check in on and possibly attend games? They have been left without an athletic trainer and their president is possbily interested in brining in an independent.  
SO...what would I even ask for?  A salary? A hourly pay?  Assuming I can go in and evaluate, treat like a PT?  I'm also a CSCS (strength & conditioning certification).  Can I do this even if I'm not an ATC?  I'm licensed in MN

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm a PT/ATC. I would check your practice act. Make sure you're comfortable with acute injury management: spineboarding, splinting,  concussion, return to play decisions. Expect lots of blood and using a lot of supplies you're not familiar with if never trained. You'll be dealing with split chins, nose bleeds, vomiting, heat illness, dehydration, etc. 

It's doable but must be ready for it all.

> **Response 2:** I’m a PT/ATC - I would check your state practice act for scope of practice. I would also make VERY sure that your insurance covers you. Hourly is going to be your best ask as far as pay. Games can last a really long time and coaches/schools will take advantage if you’re salary. I will also say - I’ve worked as a PT and I’ve worked as an ATC. I cannot stress enough how if you are on sidelines as medical personnel you need to be ready for anything and everything as far as emergency management and be prepared for the stress of coaches and parents screaming at you from the sidelines as you make decisions. The only part of my education that was the same was eval/rehab. Sideline coverage/emergency management was a big part of my AT education and not at all part of my PT education. Sideline coverage is a whoooooole other thing (and I hate it and don’t do it anymore lol).

Who has “passive income” by doing more generic exercise programs/exercise library for clients? I have a passion for helping those with pacemakers,etc as I myself have had a PM/ICD since age 24. I’ve seen a huge disparity in care after surgery and realize how many people would be better off with even generic appropriate stretching, strengthening programs within precautions. Many aren’t recommended PT after surgery and don’t know where to start. Any thoughts on how I’d do this or ideas on where to start with setting this up?
I am part of multiple PM groups and many people expressed interest but how do I get the word out without breaking group rules? Lol or just marketing this in general(outside of my city/state)?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a membership that is patient education based about starting exercise, pain relief and injury prevention that has an exercise library. I have a course platform (just moved to thrivecart) and right now I have unlisted YouTube videos and it’s linked in an airtable base. 

I’m looking into other software like searchie, softr, and spread simple that is more of a searchable database functionality that can be password protected. 

I’ve been working at this stuff for a while now and would be happy to chat if you have questions 🙂

David Bayliff and Kevin DeGroot, do y’all or have you thought about offering a smaller 1-2 day event at say T-Zero or another clinic? 

Host 15-25 clinicians who want to be uncaged or improve their uncageability to go over services and tactics for their biz! 

I would love to spend $$$ to come learn from y’all for a couple days to see how I can improve. 

I don’t want CEUs. I just want to be around other people doing what I’m doing and learn in a great environment where therapists can come together and motivate and feed off the energy of others!  

Hope it’s ok to ask here. 😉

For people who have small spaces but believe in heavy lifting, what do you feel is the most versatile piece of equipment for loading patients?

I currently have only a small room and have a pair of 15# and 35# dumbbells which has been limiting when I want to really load up for instance a deadlift. I don’t have room for a barbell or plates so I was thinking about getting a heavy kettlebell but then thought maybe I should just get heavier dumbbells or something else altogether. 

Would love any input! Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Adjustable dumbbells/kettlebells (+lifting straps if grip is an issue) is one immediate change you can make. Another option is to think about what you'd like to accomplish? tissue tolerance? hypertrophy? you can use tissue tolerance exercises (e.g. drop sets, isodynamic sets, high reps) or strength endurance exercises like KB swings/snatches/squats/presses for time.

My grandma had these XR taken after a FOOSH injury. Doc wants to go to PT to strengthen and strengthen the shoulder 🙄. I see a humeral head dislocation inferiorly and AC jt separation. Anything else? Thoughts?

Update: 10/10 pain with shoulder flexion or abduction. Minimal to no pain when in sling.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am sorry to hear about your grandma. I agree with Ethan other factors to consider. Her health mostly. 

But you can do stages of recovery. Such as sling for 4-6 weeks and isometric exercises etc and after send her back to Ortho for another imaging. I hope there is no fracture though.

> **Response 2:** Just my thoughts… 

Conservative treatment may be the right option. If it’s not dislocated but instead lax due to soft tissue injury which seems very possible since those appear to be taken in standing, then there’s a strong likelihood for cuff tear. What’s the shoulders position in supine? Is your grandma able to be mobilized to assess laxity? If the deformity on xray is related to laxity then what other options does she have? At 80 cuff repair does not typically have great outcomes. Reverse TSA may fit but that’s a long rehab and likelihood she would be able to remain independent throughout the majority of it are really slim. If PT can manage pain and provide some stability to the shoulder so that it’s functional for her it’s potentially a win win.

Looking into having personalized scrubs made.  For those with DPT do you put  
Dr. (Name) PT,DPT or just (Name) PT,DPT  

Anyone ordered online for this or did you use a local company? Love some recommendations.  Font size?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I worked hard for my doctorate, and am proud of the title, so I use Dr (name) PT, DPT. I see personalized scrubs, white coats, etc with both though. A lot of companies will embroider for a small fee when ordering.

2. Best TMJ certification course?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** APTA Orthopedic Section had a monograph on TMJ that is super comprehensive. Has all the info you should need to properly treat it- and my fallback to fill in the cracks is usually medbridge. 

Also I’ve done pelvic floor level 1 through APTA and Herman Wallace- Herman wallace was the best. Hands down! APTA course was - well, lacking. Herman and Wallace was more applicable with the same amount of evidence. APTA felt like they just threw out a bunch of evidence and left you to self discover a lot of the application aspects.

Anyone have advice on how/where I could get CST certified (cranial sacral therapy) i am an IBCLC (lactation consultant) and see so many babies that need a little bit of tension relief. I would Lito be able to do it while i am seeing them instead of them having to wait weeks to be seen. Or at least get a better idea if they need to see chiro or not.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go with Upledger. I took their 1st peds course in the 90's. I've used it on babies ever since. It's like magic on the tiny ones. I think you may have to take the intro course 1st so you learn how to feel the CST rhythm before you try to feel it on a baby. But not sure if that's still the case

> **Response 2:** I’m a pediatric/neuro PT and am trained in CST through Uplegder. There is also a massage therapist named Lori Henderickson who does classes on infant CST. I think her class is good, but you need to know the foundational CST concepts first. She just talks about her infant specific protocol without going over a lot of the foundational anatomy and physiology.

Question for those of you who work with athletes:  The parents of my daughter’s select soccer team (11 year olds) want advice on hydration and electrolyte drinks.  I want to make sure I give them the latest research but finding conflicting info, especially regarding when/how much sports drink to consume.  They are about to start boot camp/scrimmages in triple digit Texas heat.  Last season, I think there was an excess of orange Powerade consumption (🤢😉)…What guidance would you give?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would recommend LMNT! Definitely very salty, but it’s the cleanest I have found! I give to my 7 and 14 yr olds who play sports! I water it down…use 1/2 packets in their 32 oz bottles!
Also use Ultima (not as clean, but waaaayyy better than Gatorade/Powerade, etc) and you can get these packers on Amazon and local health food stores! Variety of flavors as well!

> **Response 2:** I don't work with athletes in this capacity, but a Liquid IV packet once or twice a day (and water the rest of the time) works really well. Learned about it from my granddad's cancer battle, when he kept getting dehydrated so easily.

Has anyone discharged a patient who they felt uncomfortable treating? IVe been treating a 20yo young man with pelvic floor issues. I’ve felt uncomfortable with him from session one. Nothing that he is doing per say. There is just something. My sessions are 1-1, in closed door, very personal of course, given the nature of the sessions… and he is not inappropriate, I can’t tell what it is, but there is something that leaves me on edge every session the whole session. Our improvement has also not been great. There is still time for improvement, but usually by this point there are great shifts happening already. And in his case there has been zero changes.
I am continuing because I am the only pelvic floor therapist in my area who will see males, so I feel bad discharging without giving a referral to someone else… but I don’t think I am the therapist who will facilitate the results he needs. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Read the book The Gift of Fear - it’s by a former homicide detective. He points out that female humans are the only mammal that will discount their own internal warning system because they don’t want to make the other human “feel” bad. He makes a great example of a woman about to get on an elevator with a man - the woman’s intuition tells her there’s something off with the guy…. The woman overrides her intuition and gets on the elevator anyways because she doesn’t want the man to think shes’ a… snob, racist, a bit@h, whatever… the author points out that you’ll never see a gazelle get into a closed metal box with a lion - You don’t owe him more than a polite discharge on the next session. You’ve obviously been experiencing these feelings for many sessions - time to honor them.

> **Response 2:** Your intuition is telling you everything you need to know.  Discharge him based on no progress made, and refer him back to his physician.

What are your most creative ways of bringing in supplemental income while getting ready to launch your own business or in the early phases of starting your business?

I'm a mom with 2 small children, so looking for things that can take place in the 6 hours per day they're at school, and or occasional evenings or weekends. Currently working very part time PRN in home health, as I don't necessarily want another PT  job that will suck my time and energy while I'm trying to get my own thing off the ground! 

Or do I just go all in and put all time and energy into getting the business off the ground and running ASAP? 

Thanks for input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m still taking 15 home health visits a week and I have barely any time for my business. I’m the main breadwinner though so it makes me feel like I’m responsible for my family. But I also know my business is suffering 🥲 it’s a hard choice to make!!

> **Response 2:** Honestly, unless you are in an urgent financial need situation…I highly recommend that you go all in fast and hard 100% dedicated and focused on the new business. I have had several successful PT businesses over the years and each time….it was all I did and it flourished. Once I had kids….omg….game changed to be even more challenging.  So if you also have kids ..then definitely only work on this business. And…congratulations!👍

I got a message through my Google listing from a guy claiming to be a tennis instructor. He said he is getting back surgery soon and wants a physical therapist to work with 8 of his athletes in different injuries and wellness stuff. Seemed a little sketchy at first but I was excited about the opportunity. 
He is offering to pay for all 8 athletes in advance. Not sure how it would be a scam as he said he would give me the credit card info to run. I would require him to give it over the phone instead of text. I’m not sure how it’s a scam yet but still sketchy. There are a couple red flags such as him listing a bunch of cities that are spelled wrong and he said he is from a city in Utah that doesn’t exist. His English isn’t great and all of the contacts have email addresses that appear to be a combination of their last and first name. 

Anyways, I’ll keep you posted as I learn more info. 
Anyone have any experience with a situation like this?

Interesting experience at the dentist. My wife and I have been having TMJ issues so during my check up I asked if he had any Physical Therapists that he referred to for TMJ issues. He instead told me about two dentists both of which were very far away one of which he said was extremely expensive.￼ 🤨

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would release the trigger points in the pterygoids to release the jaw. Also be wary of opening your jaw too widely at the dentist, and be conscious of your mental state and gritting your teeth so you can stop doing that.

> **Response 2:** Hi, this is super common. I'm a TMD specialist PT and my husband is actually a general dentist. Dentists only know the teeth unless they've hade advanced CE in treating TMD. Referring you to a dentist who treats it was a smart move, at least they knew to do that. Most dentists have no idea what PT can do for this.

I want to give a shout out to the Uncaged Clinician team and my “village” for all the knowledge, support and encouragement given to me since last October. I have 3 work days left at my job of 18 years in acute care (29 years total) and 5 years in the outpatient clinic as a vestibular therapist and will be FULLY UNCAGED! Gone are the days of working weekends, endless charting, answering to doctors or insurance companies and asking for time off!

Balance Solutions Rehab is my “4th baby,” a MOBILE vestibular PT practice helping people suffering from vertigo, dizziness and imbalance, all in the comfort of their homes or preferred settings. I have specialized training in all things vestibular but have a special interest in vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). I believe in EDUCATION, EMPOWERMENT, CONNECTION, COMPASSION and COLLABORATION with a HOLISTIC approach. 

I am 10% sad to leave my colleagues but 90% giddy for this new adventure!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I couldn’t be more proud of this step for you. As a colleague and a friend, I know this is your path. Patients can not be in better hands!

> **Response 2:** So very very proud of you 👏🏼 Shana!!!!  
You did all the hard work to get here!!

CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎈

Billing questions: or maybe more accurately… ETHICS questions… 

For clinics that have patients “warm up” on an exercise bike, Are you considering that time skilled and billable? 

Do you bill for thera-ex or act when techs are instructing the exercises? If so, what level of supervision are you providing to the techs?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Medicare and most insurances won’t pay for “warm-up” exercises or most equipment exercises if you aren’t documenting what “skills as a licensed therapist” that you provided. I just saw a denial today from UHC where they stated “NuStep is not a skilled service” and they took back the money for the time spent on it.

> **Response 2:** The time you spent on set up and education of what you want them to do on the bike could be lumped into your billable treatment time. If they just head on back and get themselves on the bike, I would t count that time.

This company near me offers Pelvic Floor Therapy. They are Naturopathic Doctors, all fine, but I noticed this on their website - are they able to bill this under PT??? That doesn't seem right.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They can see the patient for pelvic therapyas a cash patient.  but it would be fraud to bill under Physical therapy and use the patients insurance benefits under PT if they are not a licensed PT

> **Response 2:** I do not know the answer to your question. I’m learning this too. But I do know that we as a physical therapy profession do not “own” CPT codes, they are universally used in the medical field and selected by a provider and should only be utilized within a scope of practice. So therapeutic exercise can be used for different professions than just physical therapist. So physicians can bill 97110 and they would put their modifier instead of ours(GP). Also, the Herman and Wallace Institute allows a wide array of providers to take their courses, including Naturopathic Doctors. Many other pelvic floor courses can be taken by others. I know a personal trainer that calls her self a pelvic floor therapy specialist and states she has multiple pelvic floor certifications. So if it is the scope of treatment for Natropathic Doctors to perform and they have the skill set then I suspect they could bill. I see many different professions calling themselves pelvic floor specialists from holistic doctors to nurse midwives to personal trainers. Also, they are typically skillful with the wording calling it pelvic floor therapy instead of pelvic floor physical therapy.

And another question for those of you who do group wellness exercise classes for older adults...I feel really silly to ask, but how do you come up with your programming - keeping it fresh and such?  I mean, I know exercises, but the thought of coming up with content that is general enough for a group for ongoing classes feels stressful.  I mean, I could totally present a class someone else planned, but to come up with it on my own...

Are there any resources for planning and executing group exercise classes for older adults (other than Silver Sneakers)?

Or any resources for already developed group exercise class content?

*Bonus points for Parkinson's related group fitness classes

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey! So, the very first group class I ever ran was for people with PD. (I still teach it!)

I was terrified. 😂

Starting out, I just made stuff up. Or straight up did stuff from LSVT BIG or PWR!Moves.

I still wing it sometimes. But I also draw exercises and circuits from others online. My class is primarily seated (by request), so I've had to get creative. But there are LOTS of Parkinson's (or general older adult) workouts on YouTube.

On YouTube, I primarily draw inspiration from Parkinson's Wellness Recovery and My Parkinson's Gym.

Happy to chat further via DM if you have more questions!

Question for this awesome hive- I’m working on 20 years with my OCS. I’m considering not renewing for the 3rd decade due to the fact that I haven’t been doing the submissions over the last several years like they want, and really I just question the value at this point. I have just about 30 years of experience. The OCS doesn’t qualify my skill or experience or worth. Do I really need to pay and do the scut work to keep these 3 letters? I was considering putting an asterisk next to the OCS and then noting the 2 decades of active certification. What do y’all think?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm nearly 20 years in. I do not plan on renewing. Early in my career I felt it carried weight. Now I feel like it's their way to collect $$. I know my worth. My 2 cents

**Original Post:**
Earlier this year, there were several discussions here at Uncaged about what the APTA does or does not do for our profession. Listening to the voices of protest, concern, disdain, etc., made me want to create change.   

So when APTA Private Practice asked me to run for their Nominating Committee, I couldn't stop thinking about Uncaged and the mini-revolution inspired by this movement.   

I land on the side that the APTA is helpful, because it really has helped me:  
1) Make it affordable for PT's to serve those most in need.  
2) Saved my business thousands of dollars. 
3) Saved my heart by connecting me with amazing mentors. 
4) Gave me the confidence and a venue for speaking out about what is right and what is not in our profession.  

The APTA needs your voices. So if you are a part of Private Practice APTA, please consider voting for me. 
I'll work to magnify the voice of Uncaged Clinicians in shaping the future of small business in Physical Therapy.

Do any of you have a Swedish ladder? Do you use it a lot? I'm getting close to opening my own clinic and want to spend my money wisely 😁

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have one at our clinic. We specialize in offering care for patients with neurological deficits and it is one of the most used items. We use it with a wide variety of diagnosis. 
Though I would say please get it installed professionally. The handy man we hired put a flat plank against the wall to give it increased stability.

> **Response 2:** I lived in Scandinavia (studied in Finland and worked in Iceland) and we always had it! Every single clinic has one as far as I know:)! 
Very useful and versatile! Highly recommend.

Looking for some feedback please! 
I’m a PTA and have been in outpatient for 15 years. As my 2 boys are growing (10 and13) and getting more and more involved in sports, i have noticed that they and other team mates would benefit from education in posture, body mechanics, stretching, injury prevention and body work/massage… 
how can i legally provide these services for cash pay? Would love to be able to do this on the side.. i live in Tn and have to be licensed for massage, and hate to go back to school.. is their a bridge program? i have been trained and have ceu’s in different manual techniques as well.. any insight whatsoever would be appreciated 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in Tennessee. Where are you at? You can always hire a PT. I do a lot of Telehealth for other PTAs. That could be an option for you.

> **Response 2:** I totally get what you’re saying as it’s a massive need (and would help kids avoid a ton of problems!). My inclination would be to get a personal training certification and just be careful to keep all your marketing and discussion wellness based and avoid the term treatment like the plague. The use of manual techniques could be getting into a “grey area” for sure, but then again I do this sort of thing you’re talking about virtually with athletes all over the place though I often talk athletes and their parents through some techniques when appropriate. As for hiring a PT as others have mentioned I’d certainly be curious as to such an arrangement and also making it cost effective for everyone involved. I’d certainly be open to a chat to brainstorm if you or anyone else is interested. Could we create a chat in the group on this topic David?

Any good recommendations for a good course or certification on the menopausal / perimenopausal female? 

I feel like I could write chapters for the course because I've been living it myself for the past few years 🤪 but of course there's always tons more to learn. 

I'm very interested as this has been a special interest of mine for the past few years. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** AAMT! I am currently taking DN with them here in TX.

> **Response 2:** AAMT. Especially if you want to be able to effectively apply the same treatments as all the leading multi-center RCTs use. I.e. addressing the nervous system, capsular and intra-articular issues, fibrosis etc. Also pairs nicely into MSK ultrasound which is the future of gold-standard direct access PT.

Question- 

I have an individual who just wants cupping done. 

Am I able to JUST do a cupping treatment session and give her that superbill or does she NEED an evaluation prior to get reimbursed?

Or do I require the entire evaluation for the first visit and can do only cupping after that?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s an “a la carte” service. If cupping is the only thing they want, you can just charge cash for a wellness/recovery visit. PT is a full eval and YOU decide whether cupping is the most effective tool to use. I do PT and also provide DN and recovery massage as a la carte services….although i will mention that some PTs prefer not to do this bc what ends up happening is that patients JUST come for those services and don’t actually make the huge improvements like they could. Right now, providing a la carte services align with my business goals but i can definitely see people prefer not to provide it. Make sure you’re charging for your time appropriately!! Massage therapists make at LEAST $1/minute and that’s excluding tip, mobile services, and additional modalities. My rates are $2.5-3/minute. I know you didn’t ask….but I figured I’d just put it out there. Hope that helps!!  😊

> **Response 2:** If you’re wanting to submit for reimbursement it needs to be a physical therapy visit, meaning you would need to follow your practice act, which I would assume means evaluation. I perform evaluations and treat the same day every time. 

If you’re not performing “physical therapy” and are doing “wellness” then you would not use CPT codes and not submit any sort of super bill.

Next summer I plan to get certified in Dry Needling. I am in Central Wisconsin and am cash/ non-insurance based PT and wellness. Does anyone have any recommendations on pricing for dry needling services ? I’m in the preliminary phases obviously but I am a planner at heart and want to get an eyeball on things if and when possible. Any help is appreciated! Also, if anyone has suggestions on which dry needling training y’all used, that would also be appreciated. 
I am a GCS and LSVT-BIG certified as well.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I like Rachel Garrett’s thoughts. I also have had sessions where the only thing performed was dry needling, and I charged my full rate. 

What’s important, Christian Biegel, is that (all of us) must get away from “a CPT code value” for a service (yes, I know. Dry needling isn’t covered, but the concept of “this thing is worth this amount”). Instead, we should recognize that people are paying for our knowledge, skill, experience, etc. 

Scott Dixon has a phenomenal course.  There are several others out there also.

> **Response 2:** I have a cash pay practice in Oshkosh and regularly utilize DN with my patients. I do not charge an additional fee if DN is used as a part of a full PT session. I do offer a mini-session for clients with an established POC who just need DN or manual therapy. After a full evaluation session, I offer appropriate clients the mini session for $75

What is ur rate for just dry needling? Where are u purchasing needles from?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dry needling is included in my plan of care and I never do it without exercise or neuro re-ed to follow up. It’s a disservice to patients to needle them without following that up with retraining the muscle. They will feel good for a bit then have to come back for more needling since the underlying issue isn’t being addressed. My visits are getting ready to go up to $180 this summer. I pretty much use only Serins from Lhasa since I can use them for try trigger point dry needling as well as with STIM or for fascial/scar needling. They are the most versatile needles I’ve found for all the ways I utilize it in my practice

> **Response 2:** PT is not a drive-through or ala carte service. Dry needling should be part of an overall plan of care.

I have a potential referral for a child with duchenne muscular dystrophy. My background is orthopedics and I don’t have experience with this diagnosis. However, the mom really wants someone to come to the home because it is too hard to get him PT. With full disclosure to the mom about my background I would be willing to work with this client because she doesn’t have any other options. Homecare wouldn’t provide long enough care to the client and she would do cash pay with me. I wanted to ask the group for general recommendations in working with this diagnosis and if you think I could take this on. I don’t know the patient’s condition yet and am trying to go into the phone conversation with the mom prepared. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you have a PT or OT degree then you have the Background needed to treat this population. Use you critical thinking and all the tools in your tool box. The hard part is setting realistic measurable goals. Might have to do some research. Dig deep. You won’t regret it. I had a friend with Duchenne’s who live to be 55. He taught me a lot about being a human and the need to be able to verbalize exactly what you need to get the care you need/desire.

> **Response 2:** Prognosis is not good…very sad to see such kids…there is a lot of atrophy and hyper trophy of muscles( especially calf with classic gower’s sign where a patient ambulates on all 4’s) …eventually diaphragm muscle is involved in the last stages…your best bet is to stretch all the muscles of the body…pnf techniques,keep the Rom / function as much as possible and a special focus on diaphragmatic , lat coastal expansion and other breathing exs…hope that helps..all the best..whatever you do will help the child..

Hi! I’m no longer practicing as a physical therapist, but want to make sure I’m staying current with my CEU’s to keep my licensure active in case I ever need to fall back on PT. What’s the best source of CEU’s to stay fresh ? I used to do Medbridge.

> **Response 1:** Medbridge is still pretty good. They offer a variety of courses and now have live webinars. I've only done one webinar so far and it was really good. I've also done Summit, but they don't have enough courses in my specialty so I dropped it.

A grassroots change is coming to healthcare…

It has nothing to do with us, and everything to do with the fact that our profession needs something to bring us together.

That’s not the APTA…

We need something for clinicians and practice owners, that’s built by clinicians and practice owners.

We need to come together to create the change that we want to see!

From the team at Uncaged Clinician, we want to invite you to help us to make that change...

Join us for the Uncaged Community and App Launch party next week! 🚀 

Let’s go do this together 👊

I'm in need of design-minded allies!
A good friend of mine offered to do my logo. I'm a Pelvic Floor PT running a cash -only practice out of my house. My name is Bottoms Up Pelvic Floor PT, and I thought that showed a bit of humor and relevance without being flippant. 
However - this logo is EXACTLY what I had in mind, but I'm finding that the actual two-dimensional image feels cartoonish, and doesn't really reflect the intimacy and seriousness of pelvic floor therapy. Especially pain and sexual dysfunction, which are my passion areas.
Is there a way to make a logo like this more... Appropriate? Do I need to abandon it altogether? If I abandon it altogether, any brilliant ideas about a motif that would be respectful of people's maladies and also relevant to the name of my business?

Thanks a million for your ideas!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just my 2 cents worth as a fellow pelvic PT: I'd go back to the drawing board, it is cute but might not communicate the message you intend. If I were having pelvic pain or sexual dysfunction, my first thought seeing the logo might be "um...am I gonna have to stick my butt up in the air"??? or "is this place a bar??" If you love your biz name and your current clients love it, great. But sometimes a fun name turns up not-so-fun stuff when doing a Google search for the same term...

> **Response 2:** I don't have any brilliant ideas, if one comes to me I will share it.

These do not speak to me at all I'm sorry to say. I agree that it lacks professionalism. 😕

**Original Post:**
What have you guys told patients when you are leaving a clinic to treat independently? 

I’ve kept it pretty vague, such as when my last day will be, who the therapist taking over is, etc, but I have quite a few patients who want to know where I’m going to keep treating with me. 
I know there’s basically the “no poaching” ethics and what not, but one of my patients said today that it’s his right to want to continue with a therapist that he trusts and sees results with. 
Having a hard time determining if I’m in the wrong bringing patients with me who have vocalized wanting to continue treatment with me, even if I wasn’t at this specific clinic anymore rather than switching to the new PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi all!
Thank you for all the feedback and suggestions. I had a conversation with our clinic owners and was told they have no issue with me sharing my professional email or social media with patients to ask questions/keep in touch, and if that leads to them choosing to treat with me then so be it. They did ask that I do not share specifics of my plan, such as treating mobile, etc, unless asked after my departure from the clinic, which I more than understand.
So for now, I will just be passing that info along, if asked, and keep advocating for the new PT coming in because he’s a great new grad with a lot of love for the profession🙂

> **Response 2:** Maybe I'm the odd one out here, but when I left my job to open my own practice I "poached" pretty much every one of my active patients. 
Context. I am a pelvic floor PT. I was honest with everyone that I was leaving on X date, and was leaving to start my own private practice. I didnt ask any of them if they wanted to come with me, but every single patient asked if they could continue their care with me at my new location. I gave them the option of staying at the current clinic and working with the other pelvic PT. Nope, no takers. If they asked directly, I just gave them my new contact info, and had them contact me later to schedule.  🤷‍♀️  Patients have the right to see what provider they want to see. As long as you are not going out of your way to market to old clients, or push it, they can come to you.

Question: How would you start pre gait training on a 55 y/o male TBI patient with s/p pelvic fx and TTWB on R and only spontaneous movement on L LE? B radial fx with ability to use platform walker and WB through forearms.  Intermittently follows commands only.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** TTWB isn’t realistic in a patient unable to consistently folllow commands. Wait until he is cleared for WBAT or cognitive level improves enough for him to adhere to wt bearing status. Focus more on transfers, balance, strength etc…

> **Response 2:** In this situation I think pre gait activities for me would be to work on PNF patterns on the L LE to try and improve the muscle control, seated and supine exercises to strengthen the  R LE for when approved to WB fully. Balance in sitting, bed mobility, wheelchair mobility, participation in slide board transfer

**Original Post:**
For PT’s who do diagnostic ultrasound. Do you charge separately for that? Do you offer those services to local sports teams if they need a quick ultrasound post injury to potentially diagnose something?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I charge as an adjunct to an initial evaluation. Do your ortho or rheum style exam to get a hypothesis list and use the most sensitive tests you can to whittle that list down. Once your list is more appropriate after the objective exam, add in the US for a specific exam with a write up of findings. 

If insurance that you are contracted with doesn’t cover it then charge separately. If you have your RMSK you should not be charging under $100 for that service.

If I had time I would offer to local sports teams, but all of my kids play sports and I’m always on the sideline with one of my portable units in case of an injury and they know it. It’s a helpful screening tool to determine necessity for PT and referrals.

> **Response 2:** Check your state practice act to confirm scope of practice.

Going to speaking at a senior center  near my facility. Was looking for ideas besides a talk on falls. Any other good topics. Will be given 15-20 minutes to talk.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Teach them some easy chair stretches or chair yoga moves.

> **Response 2:** How to use floor transfers as exercise for flexibility and strength. Footwear, off the shelf orthotics and ankle ROM as balance strategies and how they relate for fall prevention. Great Seninars teaches a 14pt assessment called the AFit which can be used to give great feedback on posture, ROM, strength, etc. Great place to begin.

Dry needling experts....

What is the research/your clinical experience on dry needling and knee pain in runners? Assuming that all the other bases are being covered as far as mobility, strengthening, running technique etc, is there value to doing dry needling in this population?

I would love to hear  more as I have no dry needling experience, ty!

I'm editing this for clarification. I'm NOT interested in doing this on a patient...I AM the patient in this case.  I am training for the New York City marathon and I've been having some knee issues lately.  So I wanted to learn more about the effectiveness of it for myself and I would go to someone who does it if it is worth my time.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It depends on where the pain is.  I’ve done guided needling for a while and you can pretty much cure symptoms and pathology if done correctly.  Working on producing the research to support this.  To answer the question, patellar issues, quadriceps tendon issues, capsular issues around the patellofemoral joint - all very amenable to dry needling. Can stiffen up partially torn ligaments as well (superficial ones).

Try it,  you should find some benefits.

> **Response 2:** I have found it very helpful, especially some areas that are hard to get to manually. Recently had someone with strained post tib and ran half marathon with no pain after one session of dry needling with estim. Obviously results aren’t always that quick, but I would also argue it would be harder for me to address manually and his race was 5 days after treatment. 
But also depends on state as NY doesn’t allow PTs to dry needle.

I haven't ran into this situation yet!

I practice in Wisconsin and they are a student living in Wisconsin and employed in Wisconsin but again an Illinois resident.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you treating them in the state you practice/are licensed in? Then yes you can treat them. I assume they are of legal age or have a parent/guardian consent. It's about where YOU practice, not where the patient lives.

> **Response 2:** Yes. I have a patient now who resides in PA but has been traveling the country doing comedy. I’m treating her in IL in person. 

Also when I was a student in IA doing PT, I was an Illinois resident.

So awesome to have these practice owners come together to support one another as each worked through exercises to push their business forward in a way that 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙮 want to push forward.

I can’t describe it any better than what Laura McKaig, one of the members, had to say….

This is her testimony:

“#uncagedclinician  #successcouncil retreat: leveling up in our businesses, sharing our dreams/visions for future growth, fellowship over football, and of course eating! 
I've had a hard time allowing myself to really dream regarding my business, imagining its potential beyond what it is now. It's been a very hard year personally and professionally. So grateful to this group who I consider family, to give me a safe, non judgemental space to dream again, without shooting down my own ideas.”

Hello all! What do you recommend as a clinical certification to make you stand out when opening a practice? I’m an OT and have about 10 years of experience but I feel like home health has made me so bogged down by assessment visits I’m having a hard time getting back to the reason I became an OT which is the treatments and seeing patients progress! I have a background in neuro but I would love to branch out to strength training and fall prevention /longevity area. Any guidance would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wouldn't waste time or money on a clinical certification as your patients/clients/referral sources don't care about that. 

Invest in learning about: marketing, sales, automation.

> **Response 2:** I took the Modern Management of Older Adults 3-part certification series offered through the Institute of Clinical Excellence (PT on ICE).  It was a fantastic series that I really loved and would highly recommend.  OTs can take it as well.

I'm not sure how much a clinical certification actually means to the average potential client; however, I am planning to pursue the GCS for PTs because I want the knowledge.  I don't know if it will help to have those initials behind my name, but it won't hurt.  

So I think it really depends on what you want for yourself.  If you want a business where you are not really involved in patient care, then a certification probably won't make a difference.  If you want the knowledge, then do it for that reason.

Want to take your business to the next level? Follow these 3 hard hitting truths that I’ve had to painfully learn, and you will find it.

1) Learn to ask for help. Do you have trouble in this area? Pride keeps us from growing our businesses to the fullest potential.

👉🏻The do-it-myself attitude is hurting you, not helping you. 

2) Learn to communicate effectively. When asked what do you do and why do you do it, do you have a compelling answer?

👉🏻If you don’t, this problem multiplies itself when you are leading a team. 

3) Learn to understand and be comfortable with your weaknesses. (Which yes, requires personal development)

People always preach on focusing only on your strengths…I think this advice can be harmful when trying to get your business to the next level. 

👉🏻Lots of times the main bottleneck in business is YOU as the leader.

Hey all, I would love some advice, feedback on a current patient (one of my business's biggest cheerleaders) as I'm developing my ortho spine/pelvis knowledge and skills (I'm mainly neuro).  I am aware that MRIs are not always needed/necessary, etc, but I did attach the last half of an MRI for extra info.
Patient a 76 yo female, hx CVA w/ very mild right spasticity 1 year ago, has been practically pain free (orthopedically) for years.  107 lbs, eats as healthy as able.  She does have a noticeable dextroscoliosis of her lumbar spine.  Over the last month or 2 she has developed pain in right buttock, occasional n/t down lateral right leg with insidious onset.  She has had massages, chiro decompression, estim, manipulation (they sold her quick after her seeing her xrays), and will attempt dry needling tomorrow.  Everything feels better then comes back, but she's also taking max tylenol and now gabapentin daily.  She is mainly seeing me for balance, but we've tried manual therapy, exercises, etc and her pain does not seem to be improving.
I welcome any and all thoughts on other ways to assess, and help her reduce her pain.  Feel free to private message me
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As already written, had a pt whose pain didn’t resolve until the cyst was removed. My other thoughts are along with strengthening of hips, gluts and core she would likely benefit from manual LE distraction and self decompression. My experience with stenosis is distraction over time has a cumulative effect and then follow up with home decompression program. I like to use Sara(h) Meeks. She’s a PT that developed a program to decompressed the spine, mainly for those dealing with osteoporosis where certain movements should be greatly limited or avoided. Had very good success with it (like doing it for myself sometimes).

> **Response 2:** May be hard to get good strength testing because of stroke but how is that L5 myotome? There are times where symptoms match with MRI and give a better idea of the problem.

Anyone have recommendations for the best courses / CEUs if you are interested in treating runners, specifically running form analysis w/ digital equipment etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Chris Johnson

> **Response 2:** Go follow Christopher Johnson and learn everything you can from him. He does a great job simplifying the running athlete and empowers you to help guide the athlete along the rehab journey. Nathan Carlson does a wonderful job teaching you everything about BSIs which is the first pathology you should be clearing with most running athletes. Outside of that, there are plenty of good courses such as RunDNA, ICE Rehabilitation of the running athlete, and Jay Dicharry's book anatomy of a runner.

Anyone in here do post-op plastic surgery lymphatic massage? I am falling into that niche (which is cool) and just wanted to see what others are doing in terms of making it OT/PT, since I'm an OT and a CLT, but these patients don't have a lymphedema diagnosis. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't do it but I had a massage therapist I treated telling me she does it. She charges then extra bc it is a "specialty" and they will pay for it. She also says that she sells them in packages only bc the clients drop out as soon as they start feeling/looking better and don't finish the protocol and then have issues.

Neuro PTs: favorite courses/CEU’s you’ve taken regarding stroke and Parkinson’s? (Besides LSVT for PD). Looking to sharpen my skills to get back to doing more of what I love. Cross posting for more answers!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm planning to do PWR this year. I have a ex coworker that is PWR and LSVT certified and he said to do PWR as he found it more applicable to different patients and it is not as rigid as LSVT

> **Response 2:** Agreed with PWR!  I learned so much to use with PD and feel I could use it with all populations. And neurocollaborative if you’ve got the time! They’ve constantly got new information posted. It’s a little pricey but great content

**Community Responses:**

Anyone have any experience opening a business which provides physical therapy and personal training services under one umbrella? 
Looking to open a business solely for prenatal and postpartum Exercise as a licensed physical therapist and certified personal trainer/prenatal postpartum exercise specialist. Aiming to provide some group fitness style classes as well as 1:1 combination/crossover of the PT/personal training? For out of pocket only, no insurances will be accepted. Just trying to get a handle on any legal aspects of combining the two into one business if anyone has done it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do this out of my home studio. The most difficult part was figuring out pricing. Some people do a combo of therapy and training, some do only one. So after a lot of headache, I landed on one cost for either. Every person gets a SOAP note. Documentation is simple, made my own templates in google docs.

> **Response 2:** Lauren yeah this is pretty common. Exercise can serve as an intervention on the PT side (if you want) and as a staple in a wellness program (if you want)

Any great tips on converting clients from events to full session paying customers. We have a gym event coming up next Saturday that’s booked full, clients are getting 20 minute spot treatments (stretch and manual). 
I have names and emails for follow up, but would love to hear ideas on what has worked best to convert those clients to full service. Like offer booking right then and there? Follow up with a coupon, a survey about their experience, offer the next workshop etc. 
Can’t wait to hear what has worked for others!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What I’ve done… when they finish… let them know that they will most likely need follow up to make sure their issue doesn’t continue to bother them and tell them you’ll be following up in 24-48 hours to check in and give next steps. Then on follow up, book for next session 🙂

Hi! Looking for a neuro based PT for a patient of mine who is going to Naples/South Naples Florida for the entire month of November. He is post stroke impacting L side, approximately 5ish months out. Relatively high level in regards to balance and activity tolerance however still has a heavily involved L side. He wants to pay out of pocket or go cash based. 
He has the ability to volley in pickleball and go for a mile walk with SPC.
Let me know if there are any leads!

In an outpatient clinic setting, as a PT, have you ever seen an exercise physiologist perform an ultrasound on a patient? Or stretch a patient’s shoulder? I’m a little confused because I didn’t think they could perform either US or manual on a patient. Thanks for any insight!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Private practices often blur the line so much to deliver treatment , that it’s difficult to know what’s legal and not legal.  Are modalities under OT, PT, OTA, PTA and ATC only ? Does that vary by state ? Also is stretching under a tech or professional degree? When is it flexibility ex and when is it “Manual Therapy “?

> **Response 2:** Our techs (high schoolers/college kids) did ultrasound on patients and one clinic I worked at had those same kids stretching hips when PTs were triple booked. And on the same note, who is stretching people at these stretch clinics that are opening everywhere? Certainly not therapists.

Dry needling question - 

I’m located in California and I know the law prohibits PTs from performing dry needling; however, I am also a certified ATC in which dry needling is allowed in CA. I’ve heard “it’s based on your highest level of education” but I also have colleagues that perform dry needling as ATC. Any insight would be helpful. Thanks!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sorry, I have no input, but that scenario is insane. Mind blown.

> **Response 2:** So ATCs are not regulated in  CA, no governing body to dictate what can and cannot be done within the state. As far as dry needling, my understanding was that in CA it can only be performed by acupuncturists and MDs. Weird loophole it seems. I would think reaching out to the PT board might be the safest legally, although they will likely tell you that you can’t perform it. If you do, absolutely take coursework/get certified before performing the intervention! Interested to hear what the outcome is.

Has anyone done Fascial Distortion Model (FDM) or Fascial counterstrain course ?
Have you used these techniques? How effective these are and are they worth the training cost?

I am debating between the two. My goal is to add something effective for back pain patients. 

Any input is highly appreciated.

TIA🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I second the FCS shoutout that David Harvitz gave. It’s literally 95% of the reason I decided to start my own practice. It’s the single most powerful technique I’ve come across. When I first heard about it I thought it was too good to be true, but fortunately, I couldn’t have been more wrong. I’m not sure about FDM, but in FCS we’re addressing ALL fascia tissue throughout the body. Not only musculoskeletal tissue, but nerves, arteries, veins, etc. As a result, we can address more than musculoskeletal complaints. I have people come to me for IBS, fatigue/post COVID, anxiety, and a slew of other non musculoskeletal complaints. I probably sound crazy, but if I were you, I would take the first class and see if it piques your interest. Feel free to message me with any questions.

> **Response 2:** I've taken all the FCS courses. I help teach them and now host those classes. It is the most powerful set of techniques I've ever used in my 15 years as a PT. Worth every penny.

Hey gang! So, long story short, I am emotionally compromised when it comes to a personal injury and I need your input. 

10 weeks/p AC sprain, likely type 5. Initial x-rays looked like it was a 2 but Ortho said 5 based on how prominent/mobile AC is (I agree). Full motion currently with minimal pain during ADLs. 

My only concern is the joint hyper mobility especially while sleeping causing some pain in the morning that is consistent. I also can press about 60 percent weight in the gym out front and overhead. External rotation in an outreached motion also hurts. I also feel some separation/pain during these movements. This has gotten a bit better the past week. 

My schedule really only allows surgery mid-December otherwise I round trip a potential surgery until next year. Doc thought the outcomes wouldn't change a whole lot waiting a year (if I did do it). I actually disagree here albeit not by a huge margin. 

Any thoughts? Advice? Do it? Don't do it? Type 5 isn't usually treated conservative and information on this is limited.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Brace it and try to minimize irritation. Not worth it. Wait till surgery.

> **Response 2:** Thomas, I think your decision should be based on your long term goals.  if you’re going to wait on surgery, then you know that your rehab has to be top-notch. Not only stabilizing everything around the AC joint, but making sure that you have proper mobility through rib cage thoracic spine, scapula and GH joint so that AC joint is not further strained to accommodate the lack of motion at those areas.￼

Folks who work VIRTUAL PELVIC FLOOR therapy. Would you share “how” do you structure your online session? My sessions are so “hands on”: balancing pelvis, manual, internal work… that I am wondering how I would move it virtual.

Any course, book, or program that may assist with this transition? Or even someone who may be willing to chat with me (paid)? Thanks 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Would highly recommend to follow @pelvibiz on instagram she teaches how to transition into virtual pelvic floor sessions. She does a few free masterclasses here and there

> **Response 2:** Yes I have written out all the dx and what to do with them every week including males with ED. 

Been doing it now for 4 years. 

We do 45 min session and then 15 mins to send a summary of what we talk about. 

It’s more coaching instead of manual. 
It’s a skill we teach people to get the best results.

Any thoughts on the best certification?

**Community Responses:**

I am looking for a physical therapist in The Woodlands Texas that takes Medicare. My elderly dad has had back pain for a month and he really needs somebody good who knows what they’re doing. ￼ His current PT is doing general leg strengthening with him and nothing to address the actual back pain 😬. ￼ I don’t live in the same city, or I would treat him myself. I’m doing what I can through FaceTime.

If he specifically asks for me so that he doesn't get a PTA I will make sure he gets treated properly.

I have my biggest comp of the year coming up in 16 weeks and could use some extra support in dealing with a few tweaks so I can push as hard as possible. Does not need to be insurance based and would prefer to be referred to an individual rather than a “sports clinic”. Thank you in advance!

For those who offer straight up stretching services in addition to regular PT eval / treat — do you do a separate consent form since it isn’t actual physical therapy if you’re not evaluating and treating an issue / pain etc - they just want 30 min of being stretched, full body ? How do you advertise this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same! Wondering how/ if people offer ala carte services like cupping or taping sessions after a workout class or after an event?

> **Response 2:** I have people often ask for specific things but i encourage them to just use my PT services and we include what they are requesting.  This makes it to where my system is simple and streamlined for billing and invoices etc. 

And it produces better word of mouth because the clients really benefit from the manual therapy, dry needling, education, exercise etc.  It makes for better word of mouth about my business in the community.

Pelvic PTs!! 
For those of you performing internal pelvic floor exams, how are you handling disposal of used gloves, chux, and other items that may come into contact with bodily fluids?

Are you treating these as regulated medical waste in your clinic, and do you use a dedicated biohazard receptacle and pickup service?

A fellow business owner asked me about this, and I want to make sure my setup aligns with New York’s requirements. Curious how others are managing it!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you!!

> **Response 2:** Every clinic I’ve worked in just threw the stuff in the trash. This is the same for working in acute care - if I patient had a BM on the floor or their chux were soiled with urine, it all just went in the trash. Even my gynecologist just throws stuff in the trash. It’s not the same as sharps as the risk of a stick and blood born pathogen spreading are so incredibly low.

Calling Scoliosis certified therapists! 

I'm looking to get certified either this year or next. 

Opinions on Schroth method or BSPTS- North America/Rigo method????

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Which one is Schroth vs BSPTS? I couldnt find it! Link please 🙂

> **Response 2:** I’m doing Rigo and it’s based on the Schroth method (I believe Dr Rigo worked with Katerina Schroth), they’ve just made some updates over time based on research and experience which is of course a good thing. I don’t know how different they are, I’d say do whichever is easiest based on travel for courses and cost.
My patients still come to me for “Schroth”.

Hi! For the golf PTs out there… if you don’t have a brick and mortar place, do you do ALL your sessions at the course? What about if you plan to do some strengthening sessions? Can you shoot me some ideas on how/where you are providing services besides the golf course?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started at houses, then a driving range, then rented gym space. 

If you can, get to know country club GMs, and do whatever you can to try and use some space on their property.

> **Response 2:** When I started I saw them at their house, which was difficult to sell at times. Then I transitioned to renting space at a driving range in their training area and it has worked great. 

Finding space in a gym or with a golf coach can go a long ways in my opinion.

The transition of going from an employee to solo business owner generally pales in comparison to the transition of going from solo to having employees. Being and becoming a better leader is essential to long term growth and sustainability in business. 

I'm hosting a 6 week leadership development intensive starting next Wednesday to help you grow and develop as a leader.  

Want to join? 

Comment LEAD and I'll reach out with more details.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What day and time (EST) is this course?

> **Response 2:** Let’s go! I’ve got something to say on this: if you are a solopreneur, you are the CEO. You must be able to lead yourself before you can grow enough to be able to lead others. Leading others (and also raising children which is also leading others) is the most challenging thing you will ever do. Grow yourself to be able to effectively lead others. Lots of people talk about having great teams where they can truly be the CEO and be able to see less patients…well, believe me, you better learn how to lead others…and it starts by learning how to lead yourself. 

I can’t think of anyone better to lead this program in Kevin DeGroot. Learn from him. He’s too humble to say it but he does a damn good job at leading his team at T-Zero. Being able to learn from him and how he is able to lead from a perspective of faith is invaluable, and possibly one of the most important things that people need to learn. We need more leaders, and leaders go first.

Hey everyone!
I'm looking to make a graphic/poster for work that highlights the benefits of cash PT vs. insurance. I'm opening a new clinic inside a private training/classes gym and while we will accept both cash & insurance, I would like to start educating our clientele towards the cash route😂

Something that includes the number of visits, total cost of care, time invested, quality of care, etc. 

Any recent stats, references, articles or existing graphics are much appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t have anything put together but currently working on a trifold pamphlets for some locations and highlighting tailoring specific client needs with in the scope of practice (pediatric OT here).  Number of visits and customizable treatment plans to fit the families needs and meet client specific goals.  No limits to the individualization of therapy plan.  No denials for services based on insurance limitations.  

I offer to adjust the treatment plan with more parent involvement in home programming up to multiple sessions per week if desired to maximize client progress.  Both are great ways to customize the therapy plan to meet client and family centered goals.  As stated above I work with kids so parent involvement always makes progress and carryover better.  

Hope this helps in some ways.  Don’t have graphics to share at this time.

SLP question:
When a doctor says they have a potential referral for you but first wants to know if you are certified in Parkinson’s for swallowing and speech…

What do you say to them to explain? 
How do I say this without sounding cocky?

Even though I have not taken the LSVT LOUD courses, I am fully competent to use evidence based practice voice treatment to increase vocal intensity, interpret findings from a videofluoroscopic swallow study, train the patient on safe swallow compensatory strategies and/or diet recommendations. I also am competent in using evidence based practice techniques using expiratory muscle strength training to improve voice and airway protection at the same time to reduce risk of hospitalization from aspiration pneumonia, which is the number one cause of mortality in those with PD.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Be cocky! Doctors aren’t afraid to toot their own horn

> **Response 2:** Simply let them know that, yes, you have specific training that involves the Parkinson’s pt as it relates to their voice challenges. 

You can answer confidently without being cocky 😃

How is reimbursement/cash pay?

I also use cupping and IASTM a lot, but you definitely don’t need to pay for a course on those techniques.

All, 

I have a colleague who is looking to sell their MSK Ultrasound imaging device. It has only been used 3 times and she has decided to no longer pursue MSK ultrasound. 

The device is the Sonon 500L handheld, retials at 4,995 and she is looking for 2,500$ out of it. She is located in AZ. 
https://healcerionusa.com/product/sonon-500l-linear-ultrasound/
If you are interested or know someone interested please let me know and I can connect you. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Can this be utilized for pelvic health as well?

> **Response 2:** Why not continue to persue it? 
MSK ultrasound has so much potential and leading revenue opportunity.  

For anyone in the comments looking into MSK I strongly recommend it. And for reference this exact device is the first one we used in our clinic before we upgraded to a higher end unit. Ps we still have a use at times. 

It’s great for PT and OT especially the hand therapist.

Is there a good HEP app that has videos you can send to patients? Looking for something affordable because I work very part time.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Physitrack is really good

> **Response 2:** I use Wibbi. I purchased the version with exercises for ortho, vestibular, & neuro conditions. The cost varies if you don’t need or want exercises for all these conditions. It has videos & if you email it to a patient, you can see when they last logged in the view their exercises.

Is anyone practicing in Manhattan (NYC) that has availability to see a client once or twice in the next 2 weeks?  I have a lovely gentleman that will be traveling there and doesn't want to lose momentum.  It's a very straightforward non-surgical meniscus irritation/slight tear that is doing really well with manual therapy (joint glides, cupping, STM) and progressive exercises.  Send a DM or email me at jessica@physioyogaandwellneas.com if this seems like a good fit for you.  Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey, I’m in Long Island city just a quick subway ride from Manhattan. Would love to help!

I live next to three assisted living facilities. I have been tossing around the idea of a Saturday ” balance assessment” - 20 minutes each and giving a score of fall risk. From here I am hoping for some business but as a PT can I really legally do this?   I know they are of Medicare age but isn’t there a way around I am not giving them PT per say ?  Just trying to be creative. Thanks!!

This assisted living campus does not have skilled PT yet in there. Does that change the answer??  You all are so great to give answers. Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Colleen Walz People 65 yrs and older can pay cash for medical services, Right? I am PM you

> **Response 2:** Do a falls prevention class (we've done that, so feel free to DM with questions).  And yeah like others have said there is probably a PT company in there already since it's AL, but that doesn't mean they are happy with who is in there and it also doesn't mean they're doing part B.

For those of you experienced in treating Parkinson's, do you often see exacerbation of disease post surgery...ie joint replacement?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t quote me on this but what is it the average person takes 3 days of exercise to recover per each day in a hospital 
With PD it’s like 7-10 

I treat tons of PD patients like 70% of our practice and anecdotally - everything gets worse after surgery and typically double to triple what a non PD time frame is to get better  post surgery.  

Side note I have seen some amazing improvements with patients post DBS  immediately out of surgery. But then again that was specifically for their PD symptoms.

> **Response 2:** I experienced this a lot in inpatient rehab! We'd get total knees with Parkinsons there more for PD than knee. Def a flare up after or also felt/wondered if their medicine wasn't as effective right after surgery. Would usually phrase it as "your body requires extra time to process, including your healing." Completed less TherEx and a lot more Big movement work outs. 
The pain associated with improving range would also trigger more sx. As long as the range was functional we limited heavy interventions to improve to full(at least in acute phase). Same with new learning for compensatory strategies depending on where they were in their disease progress. Focused on what they felt was most important: usually going to the bathroom, but could care less about shoes kind of compromise in independence goals.

Okay posting this to see how this could even be feasible. 
I love working with stroke clients and do extra CEUs and certsnpertaining to stroke even though when I see them in my current role can be few and far between (although they send tons my way when they have them). Just recently I’ve had a couple strokes who were told in rehab they’d never walk again and I’ve gotten them walking with assist in the first few sessions. It may not ever be their primary mode of mobility but the fact that they see they CAN at all is a huge motivator for them and family. And I always preface with “this may still not be your main mode of mobility and we have to figure out a way to be at peace with that”. 
That being sad I’ve toyed around with an idea of how I could develop a post “traditional” therapy route where I can further work on their skills and recovery, at the point where many start to drop out of the system because they’ve “plateaued”. 
I follow a coupke insta accounts of therapists who specialize in niche and iffer “intensives” like a 2-4 day program that focuses on them for x hours a day obviously with built in rest, but trying to do a ton of reps in a short period of time to re stimulate neuro plasticity to add more skills, awareness, activation, etc. 
now how the heck could one even attempt to start this. I’m thinking because it’s so out of the box it would have to be private pay, not sure how I could “bill that” but then it also filters out all the Medicare clients which is a huge part of the stroke victim community. 
Also licensing, I would think the easiest way is for them to travel to me but that’s not always feasible either. And not sure how that works if I’m licensed in one state (it is a compact state) and they live in another. Or whether travel for me would have to be inckuded for me to travel to you (which could put a strain on us as we have 3 girls under 5 and my husband works long hours in food and beverage hospitality). 
Like I said, I’m not even sure something like his would be feasible, but when I give clients that glimmer of hope it’s amazing. Not only that but their transfers get significantly better once they learn to trust that impaired leg even just a smidge which decreases caregiver burden. 

If you’ve made it to the end, thank you! And thanks in advance for any advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You need to chat with David Bayliff, Josh Payne, or Kevin DeGroot! I see your passion and your dream all over this post and that’s half the battle of getting started! Now you just need direction! I wish the best for you!

> **Response 2:** Offering adaptive fitness/wellness training is a niche that rehab clinicians can be well suited for.  I've spent 6 months training a person with an incomplete SCI.  He returned to his neuro out-pt PT and they are impressed with how strong he is!  Which has accelerated his progress with all mobility and gait.

Hi guys! EMR question here. I attempted to find the answer to my question on here but didn’t see one specific to my question. 
I currently have hellonote and it’s user-friendly and relatively inexpensive. The only downside is that it’s documentation set up is geared more toward the neuro population. It does have sections to put in ROM and MMT values but it doesn’t have any ortho special tests or areas for joint mobility assessment. I’m primarily looking to treat athletes/fitness athletes.

Does anyone recommend another documentation system that is more specific for the ortho/athletic population? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have you talked to Steve Glukh? They can add tests to the list for you to choose from…. And ask about the new format that will be coming out with the upgrade 2.0. Steve is easy to work with…

Hi! I became uncaged about 2.5 years ago and started delving deep into helping those with osteoarthritis particularly knee and hip osteoarthritis 🦵🏽

I started focusing on online education for both patients and clinicians and just created a CEU course that's available for both PTs and PTAs. 

The opportunities are truly endless! The course is 5 CEUs and is on sale through the Labor Day Weekend. If you're looking for CEUs and want to gain a different perspective for treatments in those with knee OA- sign up link is in the comments 👇

Hi all! I’m doing a presentation this week (half hour) to young gymnasts (ages around 10-12). I have some content ready (stretches, when to use ice versus heat etc)- but is there any other glaring content you think is good specific for gymnasts? Any suggestions helpful! I was a gymnast when I was young so I do know that side of it, but I’m looking for other specific ideas I should talk about or good resources!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would talk about how food fuels performance.

> **Response 2:** Fueling for training, performance & recovery!  Maybe briefly touching on the fact that it’s normal & healthy to get a regular period, since they are close to the age it will/should start. Also, i like to use a guideline of age = absolute max training hours/week (so a 10 year old shouldn’t be training more than 10 hours/week), and that should include all aspects of training not just the actual gymnastics part. I can’t remember where I got that, I think from CSM when I was a new clinician.

Has anybody ever sponsored a local athlete? What was the arrangement?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I mostly sponsor Hs athletes. College athletes will cost a pretty penny to sponsor now days with NIL. PM and I can let you know what some of the rates I see PTs and Chiros offering for college sponsorships. 
For my HS kiddos. I may sponsor them and provide free services but then will have classes where the athletes bring a friend but the friend pays. I like group student athlete sessions for a lot of reasons.

> **Response 2:** I’ve received a lot of those offers before. Also, before earning my DPT, I completed a Master’s in Sports Management and worked in that field...so I’m pretty familiar with how these things are typically structured. Feel free to message me if you want a second opinion or some honest insight. I’m happy to help however I can. In my experience, the reality usually doesn’t match the hype so proceed with caution my friend!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pull some systematic reviews on the topic and educate your patient and doc and then get the patients better without it!! Now that being said I would use manual therapy, massage , dry needling and any other modality you have available if it’s indicated to go with the exercise piece but don’t do phono to please the doc! Let’s be experts and find systematic reviews and back up why we are doing what we are doing and have a conversation about it for our patients!

Hi. Has anyone done a service exchange and seen a client for free? I'm an OT who is also pelvic floor therapist and I'm 31 weeks pregnant. I met a doula who would like me to see her for pelvic floor therapy in exchange for her doula services for me. Do you just modify or add in your paperwork to state something like - this contract guarantees 1 OT pelvic floor evaluation and 9 treatment sessions in exchange for complete douls services per ____'s contract." Or better language than that but still the same concept. Is there anything else I need to do in particular for this type of relationship and contract? Thanks for any help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am always wary of trades. Even if it seems even. Both your services have a monetary value, why not pay her and she pays you? 
And I his is 100% playing devils advocate what if she can’t attend your birth for some reason and you have already provided pelvic health services? Does she pay you back? What if you have a precipitous birth and she is only there for 20 minutes? Is it fair in exchange for 10 hours of OT or if she is with you for 36 hours because you have a long labor do you owe her money? I would make all these clear in the contract if you decide to go ahead. Ps I’m a pelvic health OT too :)

> **Response 2:** I always break down the cost, and apparently I’m the odd man out- but I LOVE trades 🤣. Been doing it for years! For doula services, I’d just divide her payment by your hourly rate and see how many sessions that gets, and put that in the contract. Barter systems are freaking fantastic IMO 🙌

So if the doula costs $1200 and you charge $200/eval and $150/session, she’d get 1 eval and 6.67 sessions, which I’d round down and give her the extra $100 back to make it an even trade.

What other offerings do you provide outside of 1:1 patient care? 

I am a solo provider practice and I don’t plan to be anything beyond that. I would love to hear some ideas of other ways of serving clients on a larger scale and also having multiple revenue streams.

Just for reference: I specialize in women’s health and work with female athletes.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You might consider rather than discharging patients after they are done with therapy or keeping them in house for wellness, moving them to a remote wellness program. Only takes a little bit of time each week to update a program or check in and they get value through strength and conditioning. Plus they don’t need to come into the clinic, keeping time slots open for new patients or ones who might need to be there for more focused care. Would fit well in your women’s athlete niche

> **Response 2:** Online courses and as for another revenue stream (but not service) affiliate marketing. These are more hands off. 
Def agree with US for clogged ducts and dry needling as great options too!!

I've been a PT for a long time but newer to this specialty so I would love to look at others' forms  to make sure I'm not leaving anything out. I took Herman and Wallace PF1 2 years ago, and just completed the  PCES certification with Sarah Duvall.

**Original Post:**
Would love to hear thoughts from anyone who has done programs instead of packages for their practice. 

I’ve heard of this idea and played with in my head a bit and like the concept. I like the idea of committing to a program and outcome instead of set number of visits.

Am curious to hear from those who have done it how they have broken that down? And pros/cons or other things to consider from doing it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I personally love the idea of programs as it makes your offer much more about what the patient actually cares about. I often compare it to someone remodeling my kitchen - I don't pay them to come to my house for 5 days, I pay for a remodeled kitchen! The challenge with PT obviously is that it isn't just reliant on the PT but also the patient doing what they're supposed to. 

That is where programs are very helpful -- you have a little more clarity on outcomes as your program is usually tied to a specific injury/diagnosis. I also love the idea of a "conditional guarantee" where if the patient meets certain requirements (does their HEP, etc) then you can offer some sort of guarantee on outcomes. Something that 95% of clinics aren't doing and helps you stand out from the pack. 

My wife's clinic implemented something like this and it has made a huge difference. She says it also makes selling much easier for her as she has a program for their specific injury and you're just selling that vs. trying to guess how many sessions someone will need. She priced it at what she thought the max amount of sessions would need to be for her program -- if the patient gets better sooner than that then they are happy as they reached their outcomes faster and she is happy as that boosts her profit.

> **Response 2:** Benji Toh I think it can work well for things like post op ACL, hamstring strains, plantar fasciitis to name a couple. I haven’t tried this but I think it could work.

**Original Post:**
I need some ideas to increase flexion/scaption ROM after a reverse TSA. I have a patient who sustained a humerus fix during a snow skiing accident and required a subsequent reverse TSA. I suspect the pre-surgical trauma is slowing his progress  He’s 11wks S/P and still having significant pain…and his flexion ROM has been around 130 degrees for the last couple weeks. Clearly, I’m doing about 20 min of PROM and mobs twice weekly. His scap mobility is good.  It’s the glenihumeral joint and lats that seem stiff. Ultimately, I’d like to see him get about 150 deg flexion.  I appreciate any ideas.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'd stop trying to get more range. That's about as good as you are going to get a rTSA. He is probably in more pain because you are pushing the joint beyond what it should do. Work on mid range stability and correct muscle activation and he should continue to improve. I'd also do a lot of STM to the infra and teres muscles as well

> **Response 2:** A reverse TSA to 150 may not be a realistic goal

Wanting to get some opinions. I'm a male therapist who is the only employee in my new clinic. I treat a wide variety of people, but the demographic that brings up my question is the female minors I see that are not accompanied by a parent. If I plan to do any manual I do request that somebody else accompany that patient to their appointment.  I can't imagine any scenario where anything would show up but wandering thought got the best of me.  In a CYA mindset, is it appropriate to have camera monitoring on full time just in case anything was to arise? Is that legal? Would I have to have each patient/guardian sign an informed consent etc? Thank you for your input.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Honestly, I wonder about anyone treating a person of any age, alone in an office.

> **Response 2:** Leave the door open, have patient come in gym clothes and definitely have a female staffer nearby. I don't know where you are located but treating extremities seem less risky than thoracic or lumbosacral/pelvic/hip/ SI treatments. The clinic should cover you but you want to be as transparant as possible. I'm sorry this is the world we live in.

Anybody had good luck with applying estim or Russian estim to the medial quad to get it to activate for a pt post PCA stroke (minimal impact) and post TKA about 8 months ago? 
I have a pt in home health who is in 60s and still got life goals to meet but can’t walk steady and demonstrates knee valgus. Atrophy is noted on the medial side of quad. Anybody have better suggestions? 
Would greatly appreciate.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We just purchased a Bioness quadricep e-stim unit. It works the same as the foot drop model with a gyroscope the patient uses.  Every time they heel strike it kicks on.  

It is very high in price but they do work with the VA and get them covered for patients.  

If you follow the same concept, regular NMES would be the same.

> **Response 2:** If the issue is valgum, medial knee strengthening is probably not where you need to be focusing. I’d switch gears and look hard at the glute max and femoral external rotators.

Just started my own cash based practice in Richmond, VA but still trying to figure out my niche as I find clients. I have a personal training background before becoming a PT and I work outpatient and SNF currently (both per diem). 

I’ve been thinking of taking some courses to specialize in something to set me apart. My two thoughts have been pelvic floor and TMJ. Anyone work specifically in these areas and have recommendations or input on con ed to get started?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My advice would be to only enter a specialty if you're passionate about it, not because you think it will get you clients. As a pelvic floor therapist, you have to be knowledgeable about pregnancy/postpartum/reproductive care, gastroenterology, urogynecology, menopause, etc. so one or two courses is not going to cut it, it's a lifetime of learning!
That being said, we were all beginners at one point so if you are truly passionate, you'll want to start with Pelvic Health Level 1 through either the APTA or Herman & Wallace. But just know that it doesn't stop there and you will need to continue to take many, many courses to truly excel as a pelvic floor therapist as there's so much about this specialty we don't learn in school.

> **Response 2:** Hi Jazlyn! Your personal training background can be a great way to set you apart! I agree with Rachel's recommendation to only enter a specialty if you're passionate about it.

I am in the (very) early stages of negotiating renting out of a gym. I would love to have some seminars to offer both to increase my value and for marketing. I have done a core and pelvic floor seminar for a crossfit gym in the past which was well received.  What other seminars have you guys done for your barbell athletes?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Overhead and front rack mobility, shoulder pain, back pain, knee pain, ankle and foot pain/mobility, hip pain/mobility. Running assessments, pelvic floor focusing on reducing leaking, breathing and bracing. Talk to the gym owners and see what the members are struggling with currently,

> **Response 2:** I’ve done quite a few. Form + breath mechanics for better performance, lower back pain prevention, general core education. I specialize in pelvic floor so I have also done them on bladder leakage prevention and heavy lifting.

Hello, when I was an aide many years ago the clinic I was at had a massage therapist. The massage therapist would perform  manual therapy (soft tissue) and then the PT would come in and do a little more quick manual (joint mobs,etc) and then proceed to do the rest of the appt like NM re-ed. So 30min with massage therapist and 30min with PT. They billed the whole treatment including the manual therapy units under the PT. Does anyone do this? Is this legal? I’ve tried to find info in my state practice act or online but couldn’t find anything substantial. I think some chiros do this?

This clinic was hybrid cash and PPO. No Medicare.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would think the only way it could be billed under the PT is if the massage therapist was working as an aide. But I don’t know if any states allow for manual work to be done by an aide, only exercise

> **Response 2:** My concern is why you want to take someone else’s liability on you? Taking a PTA is a different story as we know we are legally allowed and we know what their education was. But LMT, (Not trying to talk LMTs down)…. It is completely out of scope of practice to supervise LMT.

Has anyone does back to back sessions with a patient before? For example: Monday and Tuesday.

This is a trend I am seeing near me from a local orthopedic group. I feel some can handle this but patients may be tired from back to back says. What are your thoughts? Any pros that I may be missing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always envision each session an extension of the last, you either diversify or you stack on what was already done. 

However,  if you're not making the POC for your patients and doing what you believe is right for their situation you're giving away your autonomy.

> **Response 2:** Depends on the diagnosis.

Total knee, and we're working on hard stuff that I KNOW requires recovery time? No. Not doing back to back. 

Balance stuff? Tons of room to mix things up. Can easily do back to back, even if the activities are moderate intensity for that individual.

For those who dry needle, what are your thoughts? Just bang for your buck? Worth it? 
In NJ it took a while for PTs to be able to do this, but seems like it also requires 40 hours of hands on- which I am okay doing. But just wondering for those in a hybrid practice (cash, medicare and OON benefits) is this worth it of would you recommand spending the moeny on other courses?
I love to learn - and being hands on is something I actually enjoy and feel it connects me to my patients and helps with their recovery so looking into where I should allocate some CEU money. 
I specialize in pelvic PT if that helps!
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It's a game changer in my opinion! NJ requirements are 80 hours total...40 hands on/40 academic. You will need them to ask be live webinars. Consider myopain which has a third course for pelvic floor! I'm sure there are other ones as well. I liked IDN bc it covered most of NJ requirements with the least amount of money .... Of course that just means I get to take more DN courses with the money saved lol. As reference, it cost me like 4-5k to get certified and I made my money back with packages

Hi everyone — I’m hoping to learn from those who’ve been through this phase.

I’m a PA-licensed PT, Schroth-certified, building a very small, part-time cash-based practice Reedy to Align, LLC. I offer telehealth PT in Pennsylvania and education-based scoliosis coaching nationwide, and I’m being very intentional about staying compliant and ethical.

I’ve been doing the work — phone calls, faxes, in-services, and relationship building — but I still have very few patients, and I’ll admit it’s making me a little nervous.

For those of you who’ve successfully grown:
 • Is this early slow phase normal, especially for a niche specialty?
 • What strategies actually helped you get your first consistent patients?

I’d really appreciate any perspective or reassurance from those who’ve been there. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi, I am also a PT in PA(Philadelphia suburbs), Schroth-certified. A lot of patients find me through the Schroth registry. Do you have a brick and mortar clinic. The majority of the people reaching out would like in person PT. Feel free to contact me to brainstorm about the challenges.

> **Response 2:** Are you telehealth only?

**Original Post:**
I've been a solo mobile outpatient provider for 5 yrs. Worked in many different settings for several years prior including neuro, vestibular, some ortho, home health, and more recently some pelvic health. I also provide mobile personal training services. 

I enjoy what I do but I'm getting tired of the driving and I don't want to go back to a clinic setting. 

I've been considering moving my business in a different direction. I've always been passionate about the wellness/fitness/nutrition space and I'm considering two ideas:

1. designing an online coaching program for the 40-50 and up demographic. I feel this is a very underserved population. I also have a personal training certification and I'm currently studying for my certified nutritional coach certification. I have a lot of pre-existing knowledge in both of these areas since they have been a lifelong passion of mine. This would fall strictly under the non-physical therapy category and would clearly be defined as such. 

2. My other and newer thought is to design written programs/guides that people could purchase. For example, mobility training, a beginner's guide to strength training, an intro to balance training,  intro to your core and pelvic floor, how to successfully achieve fitness and weight loss during menopause etc.  

I'm a big consumer of social media, vs actually posting, but I realize that for both of these I would have to do more posting, promotion and marketing. Also, because of my current algorithm all I see are physical therapy and wellness posts so it's hard to tell if this space is truly saturated or if it's just my algorithm. I'm thinking the latter.

I'm having a hard time deciding which route I would like to take. My mobile practice is doing quite well, so this has to make sense financially. But I'm really itching for a change. At this point I don't really need a full-time income, probably just half. But it's something I want to develop as I head into the last 8 to 10 years of my career. 

I think about this all the time as I have lots of time in the car 🤣🤣.  I have a notebook full of ideas for content creation, and both ideas above but they do nothing just sitting there. 🤪

Would love suggestions and input from anyone who has done either! And maybe a swift kick in the butt to just do it already!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Anthony Maritato tagging you because I would love your entrepreneurial take on this!

> **Response 2:** Britni Barber I wanted you to see this as #2 is my latest idea. I pmd you also.

Clinicians who run a solo practice part-time: when you reach the point of a waitlist, what have been your next best steps to keep scaling your practice? Raising prices? Going to the online space? Memberships? Other way of generating revenue?

For reference, I specialize in working with pelvic health and female athletes. Both for physical therapy and wellness coaching. ￼

My practice is booming on all fronts. I am scheduling out evaluations 4 to 6 weeks from now. And I only see that growing as referrals keep coming in. My intention was always to run my practice part time. I don’t intend to hire additional staff at this point. ￼￼

Anyone out there doing ‘Nasal Release Technique’? Just saw something online about this and watching videos on this. Looking to see if anyone has done this, certification out there, and supplies. PT, chiros, naturopathic, and general practitioners all do this apparently. Sounds like an easy cash pay thing with instant results.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Counterstrain provider here
We definitely treat sinuses & beyond. As far as facial, oral & cranial structures go, there's a lot of potential in those regions! (Fully cash practice specializing in fascia - just for reference)

> **Response 2:** I’m a Myofascial release therapist and we do all sorts of cranial work, in the nose, in the ears, in the mouth, belly button etc, I’m also a pelvic floor therapist so I’m in those areas too releasing tension.

Hi everyone! Is there anyone here that specializes in treating patients with abdominal adhesions post surgery?  Or familiar with the Wurn technique?  I am asking for a dear friend that is dealing with a lot of pain after having a hernia surgery back in August - and is finding little relief 😞
Thanks so much

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do a lot of scar work. Is it possible that there’s something wrong with the mesh? What does the surgeon say about the ongoing pain?

Quick question:
I’m PT. Do I need a special certification to perform a Functional Capacity Test? Pt is applying for disability. 
TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The words you choose to use here are important.

A functional capacity evaluation as a very specific test. I used to perform them and yes, I went through the training in with certified.

But my guess is nobody is asking for an FCE.

SS and disability doesn’t require an FCE. 

https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms/images/SSA4/G-SSA-4734-U8-1.pdf

> **Response 2:** It really depends on who is paying for it and what they require. Can I evaluate ones functional capacity and report it to you? Yes. Am I certified in Isernhagen? Not anymore. Does that stop case managers from requesting that I evaluate a client's ability to safely climb a step stool and retrieve a 50# item from overhead as part of a progress note or reevaluation? No it does not. Do I offer 8 hour FCEs anymore? Nope.

Hi everyone!
I am collaborating with a family-friendly gym to provide a workshop and then an 8 week class focused on pelvic floor and returning to the gym postpartum. The goal being that at the end of the 8 weeks, participants feel comfortable joining the regular group classes without discomfort, leaking, or doubting that they can keep up because they will know how to modify movements. The workshop will be one hour and used to draw interest to get people to sign up for the class. 
I would love your thoughts and ideas on what should be included in either the workshop or the class itself. This is my first time partnering in the community like this!
Thank you so much in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Try to offer it at a time of day where moms are most likely to be able to find coverage for the baby (e.g., evenings) - this was a huge barrier for me postpartum if classes were mid day

> **Response 2:** Fellow PFPT here. I think in the workshop I’d hit the what’s common vs normal piece first (leaking, pain, hyper mobility, etc). I just took a class where we talked about teaching people how to palpate sit bones and pubic and tail bone to help visualize and feel for a pelvic floor contraction. I like that since you obviously can’t do a real PF exam in a group setting. 
I’d focus on teaching some general recruitment, coordination, and relaxation activities focusing on breath, TA, and PF (canister). Then you can build on that with functional movement in your actual class. 
This sounds like such a fun opportunity for you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just document as much as I can and reduce frequency gradually. As frequency changes I make sure to repeatedly test functional measures to assess for a decline in function and other risks like hospitalization, pressure sores, potential for increased level of care needs, and falls based on gait speed and other tests (4 square step test, DGI, TUG, ect). Also documenting caregiver training and feedback from caregivers on what they’re observing in function and concerns.

For those of you integrating yoga into your pelvic floor PT practice—how are you structuring it? Do you bill it as part of your treatment sessions, or is it a separate service?

I don’t hold a yoga certification but have extensive training through various courses, and I feel confident using it within my scope as a PT. However, I’m curious—do you think a certification is necessary? Have you run into any liability concerns?

Also, if you’re a mobile PT, I’d love to hear how you incorporate it in a home setting! Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey I recommend getting certified as well, but you can also start integrating the work while you get certified. Happy to answer any questions.

> **Response 2:** I incorporate it into my general PT practice.  Sometimes it is billed as treatment.  If it is for maintenance then it is cash based. I teach several group classes per week which has been a nice way to keep tabs on former patients, bring them back in as patients if something comes up, and they invite friends/family who usually end of becoming patients. I have also done yoga in homes as small groups or privately when I was more mobile. I only got my certification because I had time during the pandemic. Otherwise, it really is unnecessary. PM if you want more details 🧘🏻‍♀️

Hello, 
I was wondering if anyone has received personal trainer certification after became a PT. What classes you had to take and how was that process. Thank you in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got mine from NASM. I don't really need it as a PT. Then I got more certifications. Realizing I didn't need those letters. What I needed was a kick from my behind by Captain David Bayliff . 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** I'm toying with the idea. It's not essential, but I do think there are some perspectives taught in personal training certs that don't get as much attention in PT school.

If I get one, it'll be with NASM, most likely.

Above all, make sure it's something you truly believe will be of benefit to your clients -- not feeding into some imposter syndrome.

Here is an entrepreneurial story that I believe all of us can learn from:

There once were two bakery’s next to each other in my town. Nothing Bundt Cakes and Swirl Bakery. They sit less than 50 feet away from each other.

If any of you know Nothing Bundt Cakes, you know what you are getting when you walk in: Delicious cakes, ready to go, and a great experience. Everyone who works there is always so kind and ready to serve.  Ever notice how they even come around from the counter to greet you when you walk in?

Then there is Swirl Bakery: a fantastic bakery. They had cakes, cookies, cupcakes, scones, breads…everything you could possibly imagine. Everything was really good there. It was just an okay experience when you walk in, depending on who was working. 

So, what can we get from this?

Two things:

1) The power that comes from being EXCEPTIONAL at one thing. What is that for you and your company?

2) The difference it truly makes when you are greeted with a smile EVERY TIME you come in.

Now, I don’t know why they actually closed down. But, they were in our town for more than 10 years and I would be led to believe as a customer than 1 (or both) of the above reasons led to them closing up shop.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have Nothing bundt cakes here in Downingtown.  Love the cakes.

For those who treat chronic pain:

What does your Perfect Patient Plan look like?

I feel I will need to modify compared to my regular MSK patients.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It involves a lot of pain neuroscience education

> **Response 2:** Not sure about a “perfect patient plan” as I’m not familiar with that phrase. 

I use trauma neuroscience as a method to address the root cause of the symptoms. I focus on increasing specificity of interoceptive awareness of the specific tissues involved. I also help the patient create internal safety/stability so the brain can finally process the innate memory that contributed to the altered interoceptive awareness and limited processing from involved tissues the first place. 

Ideally patient will experience significant changes after each visit while simultaneously increasing their sense of internal safety and stability. This leads to a larger window of tolerance, resolution of pain, and significantly less recurrence of symptoms.

Recommendations in DFW: (asking for a friend)

I have a friend who I just learned never did any PT for her multiple undiagnosed soccer-playing concussions. She has daily headaches, dizziness, nausea. She’s been to neurologists, neurosurgeons, done dry needling, Arrosti, had nerve ablations, had injections. She lives in North Richland Hills. Wanted to see if there were any neuro/concussion-specializing PTs who could give her a go and see if she can get any relief with this route of treatment. 

Can anyone recommend a Neuro/concussion PT in that area? Thanks!

(Dog pic for visibility!)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We do neuro PT in Bedford (adjacent to NRH) happy to help

> **Response 2:** How long ago were the concussions? If it has been a while I can do some telehealth pain education coaching. Since I’m in another state this would not be PT but lifestyle medicine coaching. As a Pain Fellow this is right up my alley! Reach out if interested. If it has been more recent then find post concussion rehab place!

Thanks for the suggestions! Website name: (forgot to ask this in the initial post ): pelvic specific or general?? 

Hello collective brilliance!!

I am thinking of starting a mobile PT practice over the next several months.
Some of you have your own practice and I have a question, if any of you were ever in my shoes and can offer advice!

I am working on starting a website and am torn between going for pelvic specific versus a broader umbrella of ortho pelvic conditions. 

I specialize in both and not sure what will be best at this stage of starting a business.

Thanks! 😊 

Yours super confused,
Tanvi

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The name should be something that can encompass both groups. You can educate the customer on your services. 

While niching down is be important, it can be beneficial to have the general name so you can adjust services as needed.

Hope this helps. Happy to chat further!

> **Response 2:** Isn't pelvic always pelvic/Ortho?

Are we as PT's able to utilize something like ethyl chloride or any other numbing spray prior to Dry Needling? If so, what do you use?
I have had a few patients ask me if I had any sort of numbing spray.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not sure if we are allowed to use it or not or not, but a big part of the mechanism behind dry needling is the gate control theory of pain. Without the painful stimulus from the needle, you lose that potential neuropathic mechanism of healing. Still get the increased blood flow from micro trauma and twitch response but I think that’s an important piece of the healing process.

> **Response 2:** I don't think a numbing spray would be of much help as the initial price of the skin is minimal in my experience.   It wouldn't help with the deep ache people experience or stronger twitches.   As some said earlier,  there are alternative treatment options.   I frequently use SCS for patients who are needle phobic or just don't want dry needling.   I personally don't find it quite as effective but try to accommodate people as much as much as possible

I'm considering a concierge type Women's wellness mobile practice, with a focus on pre and post natal but also treating across the lifespan (menopause and Medicare age and beyond as well).  I'm a CHT, so I want to focus primarily on all the UE issues that arise - ergonomics of caring for baby/baby equipment, breastfeeding positioning (from an ergo standpoint), and treating common conditions in the convenience of their home.  Question, legally can I only treat women or do I have to open my practice up to everyone?  If I were to ever take insurance would that change?  Is it possible to be cash based but still allow clients to submit super bills for reimbursement?  Thank you all for your wealth of knowledge!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think the female legality is probably a little gray. But if you are just treating anyone pregnant and post partum or going through menopause you will be working with people born as female, just may identify as something else

> **Response 2:** Just to follow up… we have several students (female) who choose to treat only females, FYI

Hey everybody. I have an opportunity to work as the Consulting PT for a doctor who is building a welness center. I would do evals as needed, make generalized PT sessions that a PTA would carry out (not under my business). I’m really wondering how I might go about this situation to make it beneficial to me.  I don’t plan on taking insurance in this situation. But hope to have the doctor hire my company as needed to meet physical therapy needs for the company. What pricing schemes would you setup with doctor who is employing my company for the various exercise and PT services they are thinking (group classes - special populations - pediatric, geriatric, morbidly obese, neurological) and Then physical therapy related cares.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not sure about your state practice act, but here in PA there is a requisite PT treatment every certain # of visits that is performed by PTA in order to ensure adequate supervision under the law....

> **Response 2:** sounds like you need more clarification from the MD on how he/she wants things to go.

**Community Responses:**

Asking for a friend (that friend is me)- 

I bought my 17 year old volleyball playing son a massage gun for Christmas because "all the boys use them". He is interested in pursing a career in PT/athletic training/etc. I want him to use it correctly and show his teammates how to use the device correctly. I went down a YouTube rabbit hole looking for reputable videos on the science/physiology/technique but couldn't determine which videos were really legit/evidence based. Are the TheraBody videos any good? 

I thought this group would love able to help me out. Please post links of videos, articles, webinars, etc on massage guns that would be age/audience appropriate. Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Personally I do a lot of hands on manual therapy and I hate the massage guns for rehab. I think they're not bad in muscle recovery after a workout, but find them to be of limited use in real rehab techniques. The oscillation is really only good when used directly on the muscle, but I find most problems in the tendons and bursae around the joint, kinda hard to get into those areas with a massage gun, the head attachments are usually too bulky, and you cant really "feel" the tissue for inflammation. I'd rather just use gua sha tools or my hands.

> **Response 2:** Honestly I don’t think there is really a “correct” way. It’s great for recovery if you’re sore but otherwise it’s mostly just a feel good. I treat a ton of runners and triathletes and mostly tell them to just avoid overdoing it to the point of bruising themselves- something I have seen way too often!

Hello all! Looking for recommendations for outpatient facilities/uncaged clinicians in  Midlothian, VA for a family friend post CVA- BCBS and MC secondary. 
"He just is having some coordination issues with the left hand and arm, minor left eye vision issues" Strength is equal bilaterally, the patient will return home to  NJ, but the stroke happened in VA so the family prefers for the patient to have treatment down in VA for a few weeks before returning home

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jenny Place, how far away are you?

> **Response 2:** Hi there! I live in midlothian, VA, I have my own outpatient orthopedic clinic, but he could probably benefit from more specialized neuro care. If he needs in home care, I recommend Fox Rehabilitation (they treat Medicare part B and are mobile) they have PT, OT and speech. Sheltering arms is also a rehab center with all 3 disciplines. I hope this helps!

There was a fascinating study that looked at the longevity of humans called “Blue Zones” by Dan Buettner and his team.

They looked at the highest concentration of areas of the world where people lives the longest.

Want to know the highest determining factor?

…

Yes, diet played a part 🍎, but wasn’t the biggest factor.

Yes, exercise 🚶‍♂️played a part, but wasn’t the biggest factor.

The biggest determining factor was…HUMAN CONNECTION and RELATIONSHIPS. 

The study deemed that being part of the RIGHT TRIBE was possibly the most powerful thing you could do for your health.

And Healthy people build healthy businesses.

So, who is your tribe?

And are you surrounding yourselves with other business owners who are where you are at and also further along than you?

Well, Uncaged Live is the beginning of finding your tribe. I haven’t met or experienced a more supportive, loving, caring group of individuals in the healthcare space.

It’s time to change healthcare through creating a tribe that helps us to make the change that we want to see.

Will you be there? 👇

Merry Christmas to those who celebrate!

If cost was not a factor, what is the absolute best knee brace for an adult in their 30s who likely has Ehlers-Danlos?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I treat almost exclusively eds. I usually start with a compression sleeve. I find that braces can sometimes over correct and they're so mobile that a slight over can actually just push them the other way.  If that's not enough I've had good luck with the ACL braces (like don joy)

> **Response 2:** Futuro are my favorite. Target sells them. She can even try them on at target too before she buys. I give them to my professional athletes. They are sleek/not bulky yet supportive. I like the neoprene Velcro adjustable brace. They have a few different options for knee bracing but I like the discrete ones. The sleeves, I recommend those more for compression or lymphedema needs but people love the copper compression sleeves. I also specialize with hEDS in professional athletes and EDS in my private practice. I usually like something that maintains mobility but has great compressive support to reduce pain and discomfort.

**Original Post:**
I need expert advice from our pelvic floor PTs. There is a new FDA approved device called Osteoboost that is designed to improve bone density. It is a vibration therapy device that is worn 15 minutes per day. It will be available in February. Research is promising.  The only issue that may be of concern is how it might effect the pelvic floor. This is not my area of expertise.  So, I really need guidance.  TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So from the bit I read… it seems a little far fetched. It doesn’t say it improves bone loss, it says it prevents it but the research shows there is still a reduction in bone density when using this device. 

When reading the research… #1 it says it is not statistically significant. #2. There is still a reduction in bone loss. 
*for these reasons I would not recommend this device for bone density. Maybe for period cramps or something minor but not for bone density. 

The sad thing is, if these women got on a treadmill or elliptical or something for three days a week, for a whole year, they would likely have greater results than this vibration belt. 

I’m a pelvic floor OT. Have a ton of experience with vibration plates for athletes, people in wheelchairs, and children. However, I haven’t seen it marketed to increase bone density. 

Just curious what makes you think it could affect the pelvic floor? It seems like it may be a good relaxation device that could help with pelvic floor discomfort. I usually recommend the hypervolt back brace that has vibration and infrared￼ heat.

> **Response 2:** It’s only approved per research on people with osteopenia if the lumbar spine. It’s a $$$ making toy. Osteopenia and osteoporosis is systemic.  The whole skeletal system is affected. We have far better evidence for exercise than this gimmick. I do not recommend this device to my clients.  ￼

I’m a mobile cash based PT who specializes in concussion. I was contacted by an athletic trainer at a local high school who asked if I’d be willing to see kids there at their training room. I don’t see why not—I have no location listed on my insurance because I don’t have a clinic, and travel to peoples homes. Any insurance considerations here that I might be missing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do that as part of my full time job (have a side cash practice) but my full time job has a contract with the high school and my employer pays for this. Other clinics in our area do it on different days, but I'm pretty sure they do it as a write off (I'm sure mine does as well). I would want to know who paying for it and the liability coverage. The other thing is many are minors, so any sort of consent to treat would be important to cover. Parents of athletes can be difficult. The athletes are typically awesome to work with and a fun environment overall, but some things to consider

> **Response 2:** List them as an additional
Insured on your policy. Make sure your policy covers services there.

What apps or programs are available for this (not too costly since I’m a small practice so would like to stay under $75-100/month if possible)

I want to have customized exercise programs that are released to clients every 1-3 weeks (ideally would be customizable to the client and take payment when a new routine is released or a subscription model). I would need to record and upload the exercise routines since they won’t be commonly seen activities due to my specialty, so program would need a library where I can drag and drop per each client

Does this exist? Learning very quickly I can’t keep up my virtual clients with two kids so need something a little more automated

I have a patient with commercial BCBS, he just got evaluated by a PT somewhere else in town. But they don’t offer dry needling. He wanted to come see me and be evaluated and do dry needling.

Is it simple where he can just come and start here? He wants to see if it helps and he may go back to the other place. So I wasn’t sure about him flip flopping. Is it same as Medicare where he can’t be going to 2 different places at the same time?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good question..It's my understanding they can have multiple evals but not go back and forth .
But dry needling isn't covered . So can he come back to you,  pay cash for DN only  ??

> **Response 2:** As long as services are performed on different days, he can go to multiple clinics. We have several patients who go to us for neuro and other places for ortho or aquatic--hasn't been an issue

Anyone doing concussion evaluations/assessments? I was curious if Physical Therapy is classified as a “qualified healthcare provider” for the following CPT codes. 
￼Can we bill for the evaluation under code 96132 or would that be our regular PT low/moderate/high complexity evaluation?

96132/96133 (neuropsychological evaluation by physician or other qualified healthcare provider first 60 min/additional hours)

96138/93139 (psychological/neuropsychological test administration performed by physician or other qualified healthcare professional first 30 minutes/additional 30 minutes) 

Any insight is appreciated, thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cognitive screening measures (impact, moca, etc) are not billable or equivalent to standardized cognitive assessment performed and interpreted by Neuropsych or SLP. Screening measures can be given by nurses or athletic trainers. I can't imagine these CPT codes would fall under the scope of practice of a PT

> **Response 2:** Depends on what you are doing in your evaluation and treatment. Are you using anything like imPact?

Can PTs treating Parkinson’s patients, share which they like better -LSVT and PWR? Thoughtson which you like better as a certification?

I was LSVT certified years ago, and while it’s a grest program we didn’t get to use the program as effectively given the protocol time line. We also only had a clinic with one certified clinician at the time so deliverying services with the protocol was hard. 

I’m a sole clinician again and wanted to see which protocol maybe more “doable”.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have both certifications and like PWR better bc it’s flexible and like the others I find it hard to do the BIG program as designed.

> **Response 2:** I am currently certified in both, but I pretty much exclusively use PWR these days. As a mobile therapist, it's just a lot more feasible for me.

To be very honest, taking even one person through the LSVT BIG protocol is exhausting for me -- mentally and physically.

Just met someone who has severe diabetes and has been given virtually no education on a proper diabetic diet. 🫠 I was googling for simple pdfs in english/spanish for diabetic education and basic food list of high vs low glycemic index.  Any great resources yall have to keep on hand?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I find that in a lot of these situations it’s not that someone in their path hasn’t tried to educate; it’s that whatever education has happened wasn’t given in an understandable format or the education was too overwhelming at the time to sink in. 

I’ve been getting a rash of oncology clients with terminal diagnoses and when I or my colleagues start talking end of life prep and education on how this will effect basic mobility and ADLs they’re often shocked that this is the end. But I can see in their charts their oncologist documented educating them, “you are dying.”

Also if anyone has any recommendations for CEU on HOW to provide that education and coach through that decision making process, I would be most grateful 🙏🏼

> **Response 2:** That is SHOCKING. So glad you're able to help them out with this crucial piece of their diabetes management!!

I don't have any resources to share. Hopefully more folks here will respond soon. 

If you're in the Doctors of Physical Therapy group, there's probably a bunch of folks there who have stuff, too

I know you all already download and listen to my podcast (Strength For Your Purpose Podcast for anyone who’s slackin) but next week’s episode will be with the CEO of Hancock Lumber (local to Maine). He’s so inspiring and as a business owner and leader I can’t wait to share this with people. 

Hancock Lumber is one of the oldest companies in all the US. It Started in 1843. And with his leadership principles that changed around 2010 they made more money from 2012-2022 than they did from 1843-2010

He also wrote a book we should all read.

I have someone interested in Dry Needling for their knee but does not want to do formal physical therapy. She has Medicare. Medicare doesn’t cover dry needling for knees so can I charge cash and only charge for dry needling? Does there need to be a formal plan of care to legally dry needle?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t see why it would matter. I’d have them still fill out some paperwork but don’t think it should be an issue

> **Response 2:** FYI check the language on dry needling for MC for back pain. PT is not listed as an approved provider for it from what I understand. Specifically for that scenario is what I mean.

I have a question for the swimming experts out there…I have an 11yo patient with HPP (soft bones) who I’ve worked with in the past.  H/o multiple fractures, including L iliac apophysis and L tibial tuberosity.  She has finally found her sport!  Swim team!…but now cannot do the breaststroke without pain in her L knee (she can do other strokes no problem)…Before I evaluate, just wanted to get your input/ideas since I am not a swimmer.  I’m hoping it’s just a mechanical issue and not another fracture.

**Original Post:**
Hi all! My first post here. I’m a full time hand therapy OT, and have been a clinician for 2 years. I love it, but I feel like there’s more I want to do. I tried a different setting (inpatient rehab) but that did not light me up at all and I won’t be proceeding with that. It’s an odd feeling, like I’m in an egg trying to break through. 

Is this a feeling I need to investigate more? I’m hopeful some of you can provide some wisdom here. 

My brain immediately thinks of being a “functional movement specialist”. Focusing on the aging population living and moving through their environment from an OT perspective, but with a strength based approach incorporated too. 

I’m worried with the strength based approach is it coming off too much like a personal trainer? 

I’d love to hear some feedback. If you have made it this far, thanks for reading!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey! What’s wrong with a strength based approach? As health care providers we have a duty to do things that are going to push our patients health forward, and nothing comes close to exercise and strength training. And the aging population definitely needs it! The benefit of doing something strength forward as an allied health provider is our understanding of the MSK system. I would say you’re much better qualified to do this than a personal trainer, especially for that age group. What in particular are you worried about?

> **Response 2:** Just a thought if you want to explore many OT settings before settling down you could try travel OT. 3 month contracts that pay VERY well and try different settings. I did Acute, IPR, Occupational medicine and outpatient. I would have loved to have tried something in PEDs the pandemic hit though and I wanted to be home.

Don’t know if this is allowed…Can anyone recommend a good tennis shoe for my nephew who has always toe walked and now at 7 yrs old is experiencing heel pain. My sister has taken him to an ortho, but she didn’t feel he answered all her questions so she made an appt with a pediatric ortho in a neighboring bigger city.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Plantar Fasciatis? Have you recommend PT? Release of gastric/soleus/anterior tibialis?  Hamstrings? 

I am a big fan of barefoot shoes, but they are not for everyone. 

Xero brand is lovely. Soft, flexible soles, wide toe box, they look like normal shoes. They have sizes for men/women/children, a great exchange policy and you can measure at home..

I have completely eliminated my own bunion pain with stretches, exercise, and barefoot shoes. 

Disclaimer: I am a medical massage therapist, reflexologist, and CST (not a PT)

> **Response 2:** For the most immediate relief- she could add cushion heel cups to his current tennis shoes. Sounds to me like on top of toe walking history, he may have some Severe’s going on too. Definitely get a PT referral

Hey y’all, Long-time follower of the page, first-time poster here.  I’m a Physical Therapist in Michigan. 

I know this question has probably come up before, but I’m seriously considering taking the next step and opening my own physical therapy clinic in Michigan. I have a general idea of the path forward, but I’d love to connect with someone who’s been through the process. I’m hoping to learn about the necessary steps, hear what worked (and what didn’t), and get feedback on ideas as I start planning. Any mentorship or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Hi everyone! Any PTs in Brooklyn (Flatbush area) that do home visits? I work with a private patient that comes to my area for the summer and she wants to continue with someone when she returns to Brooklyn.

We’ve been working on just general exercise and conditioning. She has almost no exercise experience so I’m working with her on a very basic strengthening program and giving her some cardio to work on. She is an apprehensive exerciser and prefers to have a PT work with her due to some cervical disc herniations, and a diastasis from her last pregnancy. I also do some soft tissue work with her on her neck/ upper traps. She’s very deconditioned following not having the time to exercise while caring for her children, but her youngest child is in school this year and she is prioritizing herself. 

She is really lovely to work with and extremely compliant. Please let me know if anyone is available! 🙂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm an OT who specializes in pregnancy and postpartum. I treat postpartum patients with diastasis all the time, and I love helping moms incorporate movement into their daily routines. Feel free to reach out!

I’m trying to figure out the best way to offer services. I feel like I should have a 1 hour option and a 30 or 45 option but all initial visits need to be an hour to give plenty of time for a good assessment. I will be offering hands on services such as dry needling, IASTM, cupping-I don’t love the idea of offering these as stand alone “a la carte” options though. General strength/mobility is also offered without hands on intervention. SO- is it best to just have an hour rate (your time is your time) with the goal being that you’ll provide whatever is needed within that hour? Do you have a base rate and then the other manual treatments as “add ons” (which sounds hella confusing for all parties). What works best for y’all?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same as above. Your time is your value ultimately. Your expertise, applicable knowledge, guidance, and skills come within that.

> **Response 2:** Hi! I have 1 set rate for my hour appointments and a set rate for 30 minute sessions, no additional fees for anything we do within those time frames. The first session is always an hour. My evals and hour follow-ups are the same price, though I know a lot of therapists charge more for the eval. Like you said, and hour of my time is an hour. The only manual I offer a la carte is dry needling and it is also 1 rate whether it takes 10 minutes or 30 minutes.

Chronic pain focused PTs:  have you done your own workshops focused on chronic pain?  If so, who hosted them or who best to contact aside from pain management doctors?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, I’ve been teaching pain relief classes for years, both to lay people to relieve their own pain and to clinicians to learn my therapy approach to use in their clinics with their patients.

There’s lots of ways you can start teaching, and filling your classes.

The first step is to figure out who your “dream clients” are and what’s causing their pain. 

For example, do you specialize in sports injuries, MVAs, fibromyalgia, migraine, etc.…

Once you know who you want in the class you can formulate the structure of it. ( 1-hour, 3-days, etc)

The clarity will also help you know who to connect with to help you fill it with participants or who might be interested in hosting it for you, such as other healthcare providers, athletic stores, professional organizations. 

If you feel good teaching to impart your wisdom and insight, it’s a lot of fun and very rewarding!

**Original Post:**
Hi! I am a PFPT (have my DPT) & a certified doula and work with prenatal and postpartum populations. There is a huge demand for prenatal massage in my area. Is there a way for me to get “certified” in prenatal massage? I know technically massage is a skill we know as PTs, but I’m also looking for a way around needing referrals.

Editing to add: I’m in Texas bc I know that probably makes a difference.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Since you have your DPT, in Texas you can technically evaluate and treat for 10 days without an order.  

I’m sure you have an established assessment/ evaluation process, and treatment would be the pre-natal massage as indicated.  The pre-natal population sees their providers regularly, so when the pre-natal client leaves your care after the first massage, they could take a referral/order for continued pre-natal massage for the referral’s signature.  Then you’re covered for longer than 10 days with the signed order.  

The PT Rules state a reassessment is required every 60 days at a minimum. 

Thanks for providing your much-needed services in the Permian Basin!

> **Response 2:** You would need to attend an accredited lmt school and have an lmt license in conjunction with your PT. They may let you out of some of the classes.

**Original Post:**
Can someone point me to the definition of wellness services vs PT? Like at what point does therapeutic exercise become exercise and manual therapy become stretching/massage etc. 

Mainly asking this in regards to treating Medicare patients but also when patients get transitioned to wellness program. 

What forms are you using for this?!

Thanks so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My opinion is that exercise is wellness if it’s not addressing a specific established diagnosis, AND therex become exercise after you’ve taught it. I think that for too long PT has been a crutch for people who need accountability.

> **Response 2:** As Abby Regan said, the minute the conversation becomes “I want you to…” vs “you need…” it’s wellness. How many times have patients begged you not to DC them from therapy even when it’s not medically necessary. “But I just can’t do it with it you, you encourage me and I do it better with you.” 

What they are asking for is personal training paid for by insurance. That’s a come to Jesus conversation about what MC SHOULD have to pay for vs what the PATIENT should have to pay for

For those of you who treat out of a gym with excellent trainers.  How do you balance the exercise you do in PT with the gym activities they already perform.  I find myself educating on how to do things, the trainers and I talk, but I rarely have them do exercise in the office because it seems like overkill.   Asking because we're looking to expand and this is a question I have moving forward.  TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I work at a clinic that sees a lot of fitness forward clients meaning they have a personal trainer, participate in boutique fitness, etc and I find these patients are typically the ones that need a lot of education on volume management and dosage. I spend a lot of time on programming for these patients, so maybe your time can be spent there. I also find these patients really benefit from a combination of manual therapy and neuro reeducation type exercises and/or exposure to different workout types like EMOM or AMRAP to vary the overall intensity of their workouts.

> **Response 2:** I usually have the patients do the PT exercises as accessory work/mobility work. If I know the main muscle groups are going to be hit in workouts i focus on the smaller muscles, motor control, mobility, specific tempos or range of motion, etc that aren't targeted in their workouts.

Planning to launch concierge PT ( cash based ).. I am leaning towards  NEURO  PT as the focus  .. But being new practice  (I don’t want initially to loose patients by serving only  a subgroup , so  Shd I also include in my website or brochures that other ortho conditions/ wellness / pain mgmt will be treated as well ….. or Shd I stick to one main focus area ….. ALL SUGGESTIONS/ ideas are most welcome … thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Myself (PT) and an OT colleague opened a neuro focused brick and mortar clinic about a year and a half ago and there is soooo much need for neuro specific care out there, people just don’t necessarily realize that not all PTs have the same expertise in treating neuro conditions. We have marketed only as neuro specialists and while it took some time and some work to get our name out there as the place to go for neuro PT and OT, it was definitely the right way to go. We have received referrals for other diagnoses and typically don’t turn people away if they don’t have a neuro specific diagnosis, but we don’t specifically market to other populations.

> **Response 2:** Keep it narrow.

It feels scary, but it's SO MUCH EASIER for folks to recommend you to their peers when they know EXACTLY what you do and the problems you solve.

(Easier doesn't mean it's the only way. And, you very well might see an initial dip in... Everything. Be prepared, be patient, and keep stepping forward.)

Are there any PTs in the Rochester area that are good with SI jt pain in an athlete? 

Little hx, she's an athlete who recently had SIJ injections with some relief and has been seeing PT there that are just giving her exercises mostly. She needs a PT that can help her figure out the source of the problem so she can return to activity.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Limitless and Evolve handle Pelvic health cases in the region.

ROC PT and Mana PT work with a lot of athletes. Mana seems a bit more exercise based where the crew from ROC have a strong neuro background and take some pretty unique approaches. 

I’m just breaking off from my insurance based clinic and will be mainly working with athletes and the active population. 

Lots of great PTs in this region. I know I’ve missed a few others like myself that are just establishing themselves.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have “wellness” in my DBA- it has allowed me to pivot my business so that I could open up a yoga studio as well.

> **Response 2:** I added wellness into my name for the exact reasons above! I also feel my treatment approach and philosophy in general is more geared towards a wellness approach, whole-person, beyond the physical. I feel like the lay individual sometimes thinks physical therapy is strictly what they see in the ads, what their grandparents go to, where they to after surgery, etc.

Is this allowed? A physical therapy aid performing manual therapy….. so I guess technically massage, under direct supervision of a PT.
The thing is, the aids is a qualified massage therapist. 
Is that alright?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a potential consumer I'd see it as a red flag if a therapy group claimed I was receiving manual PT services but it was from a massage therapist not a PT or PTA. Our trainings and the outcomes are so different imo. Unless it's advertised/billed as massage, which sometimes isn't covered by insurance.

Any suggestions for fun & education on fitness??? Thanks in advance

Lateral rocker boards they have to squat to stand to retrieve balls or beanbags and toss at a target

Blindfold and see the difference with visual cues removed

Hi! everyone! I’m curious if anyone here has experience doing mobile outpatient pediatric physical therapy (not early intervention, though if you’ve done both, I’d love to hear about it). What did your model look like — what ages did you serve, how did you handle logistics like scheduling, billing, and equipment? Did mobile feel viable, or did it seem like pediatrics really needs a physical location? For context, I’m looking at this as a part-time side practice alongside school-based therapy.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m an OT with a mobile peds practice.  It’s totally doable.  Challenging but doable.  It’s a smart way to start and save money rather than renting a space.

> **Response 2:** I do this! We serve all ages and mostly developmental cares but sometimes pediatric orthopedic cases. Scheduling is super hard logistically but I think it's worth it.

Is anyone here in Nevada and dry needling certified? 

Moving from Alaska to Vegas and trying to figure out their 150hr didactic requirement. Someone said I could use relevant classes from my DPT program to fulfill this, but I don't know how to translate them to hours. 

This is frustrating hitting a wall with a tool I've been utilizing already and feeling like I'm having to spend a small fortune on further con ed. 😩

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The 150 hours is fulfilled by your PT school. The 25 hours is fulfilled via your dry needling con Ed as I understand/remember.  There is a form to fill out and you submit the proof of the dry needling con ed and you should be good to go

> **Response 2:** I am! From what I remember is that you just fill out a form online. I think the 150 hours is just from your degree? And 25 from like con-Ed from a dry needling course. And submit your certificate from the dry needling course.

Does anyone here operate on a membership model? 

I'd love to hear how you structure it, make it a really good value and enticing for your patients. I've had ideas on how it would look, but I'm curious what has worked for you.

(And bonus if you successfully implement it with a pelvic floor or pediatric population. Then I REALLY want to pick your brain!)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We just tell our patients at the 1st visit, throughout their POC and just before they finish with their PT POC about our Wellness Continuity Program and what that might look like for them. 

Most of them it's personal training type visits. Some do 5x a wk x90 mins, some do 1x a month x60 minutes. Very flexible to their needs and great for cash flow.

We are about to implement the same program into our new women's health program

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not telling you what to do, but a good idea would be to have a website with a free gift like a “coming home from the hospital checklist” and collect contact info. Point your inpatient clients to your website who you treat at the hospital for your free checklist.

There’s a slight chance the hospital gets mad and fires you, but whatever.

> **Response 2:** At the beginning I worked weekends at PRN acute and m-F at my brick and motor. It's not for everyone. Then I got clever enough to schedule my OP patients  MWF at brick and motor , and Tuesday /Thursday at Acute PrN. Eventually you'll get busy enough to have your weekends.

Anyone in this amazing group have success marketing directly to total joint replacement patients?  Any good tips/ tricks with this group? My mobile med B practice is nearly entirely geriatric deconditiong/ falls (which I love) but I'd love to get more into providing rehab post TKA and THA. Currently nearly all the Orthos in my area go to corporate owned dime-a-dozen type clinics and I'd love to break into that population more. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are any of them participating in the Medicare bundling?  I am mobile and I contract with an agency who works with an orthopedic surgeon who does the minimally invasive total knee replacement. It's same-day surgery patients are sent home, we see them post-op day one, teach dressing changes, monitor the incision and do the PT, all billed under outpatient benefits. 
Most patients get about 12 visits some don't need them all some need more. Way cheaper this way than using home health.

And the physician usually does a call on day one post-op and on day three. 

The company I contract for estimates that using us costs about $1200. If they start with home health it's so much more costly.  For difficult patients we do a pre-op visit so we can teach them everything they need with regards to equipment assessing the shower all of that.

> **Response 2:** Prove to the orthos why your personal attention is better, and I think they'll be swayed

Advice please! What courses do you recommend to teach me to MAKE a course? I have 11 months OFF from patient care while living in Mexico. I want to make a course to market to the public (Pinterest, Instagram, etc) for lumbar stenosis. I am NOT looking for the cheapest route, rather the most effective and efficient (I am happy to pay the right people to help me make a quality product). Basically I want to go all in rather than dabble and would love some direction on who can help me get there. Thank you in advance!

Those who have developed a CEU course...I have some questions:

1. Is there a way to get blanket approval in multiple states without applying separately to each state? (My state of FL is $125  for 1-3 hrs but this could get quite expensive if other states' fees are the same or higher)  This particular course is for a very specific niche, so I would prefer to have access from all states if possible but that doesn't seem feasible. 

2. What format did you use? Video, written, or a combo?

3. Which platform did you use for your course? Looking for good quality but obviously not breaking the bank. 

Thanks!

Hi all! 

can i bug any of you for feedback? 

I graduated my course on holistic hormones and am a certified functional hormone specialist now wooo! I made a quick rough draft flyer and faq — 

Any feedback on my flyer and my FAQs? It’s just a rough draft for each, and for the flyer I plan on adding color / design. 

Also, any other FAQs i should add? Maybe “how long until i see results”, anything else? if you were a potential client, what questions would you have? I will post the flyer and faqs in comments 

Thanks for any input!!!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is such a needed area! I didn’t realize there was a cert for hormonal coaching. I’m going to look into that myself. I think your FAQ is great. For the flyer I would simplify the call to action at the bottom and say something like “call to schedule your 15 minute consult today” otherwise it looks great!

> **Response 2:** I would just make a simplified flyer educating your target population in what holistic hormone therapy is and the areas you cover. People don’t read lengthy fliers especially if they don’t know what it is about. I did t read the FA Q but hopefully you included if your services are covered by insurance or not. Good luck. As one poster mentioned I did not know that certification existed either.

BOOTCAMP starts on Tuesday next week! 

We have had quite a few questions about UNCAGED BOOTCAMP starting on Tuesday, November 1st. We wanted to make sure you got answers, so that you don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to learn from the coaches at Uncaged Clinician:

 1) How long will I have access to the recordings?

A: Forever. On Tuesday, November 1st every person who has signed up for bootcamp will get access on their Kajabi accounts where the training recordings will be uploaded. That is evergreen and you will always have access to them in your account!

 2) Will I get LESS value out of the bootcamp if I can't be present for the live trainings?

No, not at all. Each Training will be a 60 minute training led by Josh Payne on the topics. Then, that will be followed by a 30 minute Q&A. Most questions asked will be directly relatable to you as the majority of clinicians in bootcamp are in the same spot of just starting up their business.

 3) Would you recommend reading another book or listening to some podcasts before registering for bootcamp?

Definitely not! The bootcamp is all of the information that you need to get started with your practice effectively. Remember: The answer isn't always MORE information, but rather how you are implementing the information. Bootcamp gives you all of the information you need AND the implementable steps necessary to take action on the information. 

 It's TIME to take action and set yourself and your business up for success! 

Our team is geared up and ready to help you starting on Tuesday night 👊🏻

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** CAN. NOT. WAIT.

> **Response 2:** I have a question. I see that going over legal issues is included in the training. Does this include helping to develop a HIPPA p and p?

Any advice on starting a mobile, cash based dry-needling service? 
Thinking of primarily marketing to ENT and Dentist in small town for TMJ and Headache cases first and then branching out based off word-of-mouth.

Also wanting to avoid conflict of interest with my current employer.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Whatever you do, please do not market it as a dry needling practice. You are either a PT, an OT, a chiropractor, etc. Dry needling is one tool in your overall toolbox and should only be used as part of a holistic plan of care, regardless of the diagnosis or patient in front of you. We are fighting for multiple professions to be able to dry needle in multiple states and using dry needling as a standalone intervention is putting many of us at risk for losing the privilege. Thanks in advance.

> **Response 2:** I would suggest you join the formal Uncaged Clinician coaching group. Not only would it give you the exact steps that you need, but also specific ongoing support. David Bayliff is incredible.

I'm just starting up a mobile cash pay practice with dry needling and I have a connection for a tent at a local event. There will be over 40 vendors and none of them will be PT or health and wellness related. It's a pirate festival and I've been thinking a lot about swag, decorations, services offered at the event, and how to get people to want to come to my table and stand out. There will probably be some alcohol samples involved at some of the other tables. Any ideas would be very appreciated. It's a fun way to get my name out there in the community so looking to tap into the creative hive here! Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Can you use a safer needle to pop balloons to win prizes? Like inside the balloon is a card that says what they win? (It will make noise and people will come over to see what’s going on, then they use needles which gets the conversation started….and take home a prize ideally with your branding on it!)

4imprint does things like reusable ice packs that you can out your branding on. They’re tiny and not the best but they aren’t super expensive and they look cool. (For prizes) or little hand sanitizers and out stickers with your branding on them….or lip balms 
And pirate eye patches with a sticker with your branding….if you did in fact mean that this is a pirate themed event and that wasn’t a typo! 

maybe a silly poster or two that says to use a needle to fight pain rather than a cannon….or after a day of sword fights pirates come to you for dry needling (or when on water they use cannons but on land they do dry needling for a play on words….) 
I don’t know, just have fun with it!

> **Response 2:** Stand in front of your table, not behind it to get more interaction.
Put your swag/give aways in a “pirate chest”. 
Wear an eye patch? Parrot (stuffed animal) on your shoulder?
“DN can help fix the pain in your booty… and shoulder, back, neck”

An old patient of mine. He’s the head coach at a big school near me. We have a good relationship.

He is coming to my clinic this weekend and I’m going to show him some new stuff we have now. Like balance testing. Manual muscle testing. Ultrasound imaging. And my goal is to test all of his athletes. I’d love ti di like a weekend workshop and go setup at their school and pick a few kids to test  

My question is: should I charge anything? Like $40/kid? I could create a flyer and the coach can send it out to the parents explaining what all we will be doing and how beneficial it can be.

Or should I do this for free?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A few kids,  offer free.  A whole team, your choice.  We had an ortho physician offer free sports physicals one night to our high school team. Who do you think they'll go to when they are injured? He also is very busy and doesn't need  a much bigger load,  so just genuinely nice as well. 
I've also seen discounted exams/screens etc. 
I'd say,  what's your goal? Get in with the team? Make money off this particular offering? A favor for an old client? Go from there.

> **Response 2:** I’m a high school coach and PTs offer to come in and do functional strength testing for my team for free all the time.   As a PT myself I have never needed this, but other coaches I know have done it and it’s a great way to get in front of athletes and tell them what you can do to help them.

Hi all, does anyone happen to know if with telehealth (e.g. on the Jane App), are we allowed to treat anyone in the U.S. even if we are licensed in 1 state? E.g. If I am licensed in Hawai'i, can I treat patients who move to or live in California, Washington, Utah, etc? Much appreciated 🙏.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding is wellness yes but physical therapy skilled treatment based services you need to be licensed within the state you are providing those services whether teletherapy or in person. Each state has different laws and regulations

> **Response 2:** My understanding is as a licensed PT, OT, SLP you can only treat in person or via telehealth in the state you are licensed in

**Original Post:**
Is this legal: 
A local hospital is telling their therapists that they are not allowed to recommend external resources. 
Example: The hospital does not have a good pelvic floor PT and therapists in acute care/inpatient rehab are recommending an external PT to those patients. These therapists are getting in trouble for doing so and the hospital is calling up that pelvic floor PT's patients to see how they were recommended to that pelvic floor PT (unsure how the hospital is finding out who to call).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not sure about the legalities, but certainly not ethical; particularly if there is an area that the hospital doesn’t provide good care

> **Response 2:** Sounds like the hospital needs to do a better job bringing in a skilled clinician in that field or train who they already have. I find it laughable when a clinic tries to muzzle the treatment options like this. They’ll point fingers everywhere but themselves 🤷‍♂️

I received notification today from our local BCBS that they will start using Carelon’s Claims Anomaly Detection platform. Since I started my practice almost three years ago, BCBS has been super easy to deal with. Should I expect this will no longer be the case? I specialize in peds and adult neuro, both which tend to have longer care plans. Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have to use Carelon and it’s been a nightmare. I work in pelvic health and the POC is usually long, and a lot of patients have chronic pain conditions like endometriosis or sexual trauma histories. I get 4 visits at a time and have to do peer to peer reviews every single time I submit. Peds and neuro might not be as bad since there’s a lot more standard objective data you can gather. Insurance companies don’t care if you can’t have sex or use a tampon.

> **Response 2:** I haven’t received any notification like this but the last year has been miserable with BCBS.

Therapists doing preventive practice… would love to hear your ideas on how to carry this out in a pediatric setting. 

I’m thinking of addressing the prevention of developmental delays. So it’d be educational sessions on handling to help facilitate upcoming milestones. 

How do you advertise yourself so as to be using PT skills but not actually doing PT so you don’t need the PT eval and treat order? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I heard an OT speak at a local Rotary meeting 2 weeks back about her practice and her treatment observations. She said/felt a large percentage of little kids were a bit behind b/c of Covid and the emergence of the IPad. 

I’m OP/Ortho/Manual by trade by my thought listening to this was a cash based studio that focused on tactile skills, movement, and speaking through the use of fun and games (could even do Blaze Pods). 

I’m thinking you could make a mint.

> **Response 2:** Are you doing early intervention? Just wondering how you prevent delays with babies that aren’t reaching  milestones ?

Do you need a certification in BFR to perform BFR? We have a new PT who is not certified in it. But I am. So I have all of the BFR devices and everything.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I worked in a hospital based clinic where at the time only one PT was certified and she held an in service to train everyone who would be using it.

> **Response 2:** I’m no expert but from an effectiveness view point wouldn’t it be better to have someone certified in the exercise protocol with the cuffs (time worn, sets, reps, rests, pressure) versus just letting a PT use the equipment? 

They’d be better off sticking to the treatments they know how to use most effectively instead of wasting client time with something they aren’t trained to give best practice in. 

Also from a business liability view… on the off chance there’s an adverse effect and records show someone not certified in the technique provided treatment how will that fair for your business?

As a prior ballroom dancer, and current manual therapist, please stress the importance of leaders to never ever force a turn. He suggests the movement and she chooses to follow.

Do you girls have any suggestions for the courses I can do to deal more with clients having issues with intimacy targeting more on increasing pleasure? TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1) there is so much pelvic floor has to do with pleasure
2) there is so much mental/emotional stuff that goes into pleasure. P*rn and such can actually make it to where the brain struggles without this specific stimulation 
3) there is so much stress management that plays into the situation. 
4) your patient has to know what works for them and know what is actually normal vs what culture says is. 

There are cohorts for sexual counseling for PTs. Not sure if you already have this or not but you definitely need to be a pelvic floor PT to assess external, internal and pelvic fascia before/in conjunction with the other sides of this. 

Pleasure is a very layered topic and changes patient to patient, by region, by situation, etc

> **Response 2:** GPHAM sex counseling. Lots of recommended books there too. Books I refer to patients a lot are by Emily Nagaski: Come as you are and Come Together. It’s the science behind sex. Love these books especially since they are evidence based.

I was asked to be on the sideline for a local football team, during their games. I haven't the faintest Idea on what all I need to know or be able to do? Alongside would be an ortho surgeon who is the official "Team Doc" but he apparently sucks and isn't that great to work with. I know the head coach very well and he has been an old patient of mine who I helped avoid a surgery. He sends me a lot of his football guys. But I just want to know what all I need to know or be able to do?

I just rcently started doing a lot of ultrasound and I'm in the process of getting my RMSK. So I showed him a lot of the ultrasound that we do and also a lot of the manual muscle testing/force plate eval's we can do and of course dry needling.

My main goal was to establish communication with the athletic trainer and directly with the coaches as well in case they ever need to send me someone urgently, etc etc

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I see this topic brought up a lot. In short - don't do it. I'm a DPT, OCS, SCS, and a host of other certs. Part of getting and maintaining the SCS involves venue coverage and an Emergency Response for Athletes cert. It takes training and preparation to be ready and qualified for venue coverage. If you haven't done the prep work, dont try to provide the venue coverage.

> **Response 2:** Even if you have an idea of what to do, if you don't have the appropriate training, do not do it. You can be held liable in the event of an unfortunate incident. Message this fact to the coach and offer your urgent orthopedic care only and not on the sideline.

Hello everyone! 
Apologies if this question has been asked here earlier. 

What kind of safety measures do you guys follow for yourself when you go to someone's house for home PT? I carry mace spray and have Google location on on my phone. But should I be doing anything else? 

I am a petite female and I am very strong for my size, but I'm just thinking and looking for ideas to keep my and my husband's mind at ease. 
Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1- know your quick exit just in case
2- sometimes I leave my airpod in my ear( and kind of cover with my hair
3- there were times where I would pretend to be taking or make a quick  call just to tell my husband where I am even if he is not on the other line ( of course I asked to be excuse for the call)
4- ask if they have pets- I went to a pt's house with a pet snake as fat as my thighs I almost had a heart attack
   Dogs- i am not scared of dogs but my PT friend doing HH got bitten by a dog who seemed mellow in the beginning
5- I try to keep the door open if I go a pt's private room esp if the pt is kind of off
6- I don't take food or drinks of they offer or if I take it- then toss it later- unless I am sure it is 100% safe
6- I bring a lab coat in case I am not wearing  scrubs- esp in not so good neighborhood- I put it on- 
 - my friend coached me this- he said people will respect you and believe you are out there helping sick people - :-)

> **Response 2:** I treat elderly folks with neurological conditions... generally I only treat folks I can outrun, but I keep my phone on me, and read the room.  If the vibe feels a little off, I try to make sure I'm closest to the door, and am mindful of who else is in the home.  I haven't felt the need for anything else. I had one inappropriate patient who said some things, I had to address, but nothing that bad.

What HEP program do you guys like?  I recently added the one offered through Hellonote but do not like it.  My patients are all geriatric and the one they offer, My Rehab Connection, just didn't seem to have most of the exercises I would prescribe.

Question, if you’re doing a straight cash based, al acart type side hustle - do you still do a direct access consent form? I’m in VA for context. I have no intentions on working with insurance. My side hustle is cash and performance enhancement/proactive in focus.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The short answer is if anyone is coming to you without a referral, regardless of the payment source, you must have a Direct Access Consent signed. 
The specifics of that form depend on your state practice act.

> **Response 2:** Cash vs insurance are billing models.  No matter which billing model you choose, direct access has to do with the service you’re offering being licensed vs non-licensed. If you are treating a diagnosis or providing a treatment and that classifies as a PT licensed service in your state, you have to follow direct access laws of your state. Example in Texas - you’d need to follow DA laws to administer hands on treatments and dry needling, but not consulting/coaching. Example 2 - you’d need to follow DA laws to treat knee pain (there is an ICD-10 code for knee pain so it’s a diagnosis), but not to help someone improve performance during squatting. Hope this helps.

I am a pelvic floor and lymphedema therapist and I've got an opportunity for a good priced ad on my local country club golf scorecard. I haven't gotten official specs yet on size but I'm trying to decide how much info to include without making it to small to want to read but include the broad demographic of pelvic floor that I treat. Does anyone have any ads they would like to share for inspiration?
TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not to be a downer but I would be very surprised if this generated any additional business for you. Early on in my journey I ran a similar ad on a golf scorecard because I got a good deal on it and got literally $0 of additional revenue from it. Not even a single call from it (we ask all calllers how they found us).

> **Response 2:** Maybe use it to your advantage as a way in with the owners to set up a table in the pro shop to answer questions or even offer a golf seminar.

I might be hiring a PT that is interested in women's health. What does the certification/con-ed look like and what program do you recommend and why? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Herman and Wallace. I have heard good things about Apta courses as well.

> **Response 2:** I took Herman and Wallace and felt that it was good enough to get me started, but there are certainly other certifications to add as a supplement. For example I'm now taking my pces which is a postpartum and prenatal corrective exercise specialist, and that has been very beneficial to me.  However, I would also check references obviously. We contract out a pelvic Health PT and she came with glowing references from all of her employees and coworkers and so we knew she would be great.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pitt vestib course and Duke/Emory course are the best.
Good to have a basic foundation for both. If you are new to the vestib world then def do some online medbrigede vestib courses then sign up for one these in person ones. 
If you already have some vestib experience you can directly do Pitt or Emory course.

Most economical platform to create a short online 2-3 hour CE course for multi state approval?  I'm in FL and it looks like it's $125 annually plus the application. I don't want to have to do this in every state, so there must be a workaround to this? (FL is not a compact state if that matters)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t know about platform, but I’m in texas and I have noticed that many CEUs seek approval from Texas as it is if not the most rigorous, definitely one of the more rigorous for PT. And with that approval many other states will approve in reciprocity. Plus Texas just has a large volume of people that could be potential customers.

Clinical Mentorship. 

We all want(ed) it when we first got started and let's be real... if you're on your own as a clinician in a practice you miss being able to bounce ideas off of others. 

Residencies have their place but the reality for most residents is they work way more hours and get paid less than their worth for the HOPE that they actually get mentorship that may or may not ever happen. 

Image having access to pick the clinical brains of some of the brightest minds in PT, OT, SLP, etc. 

That's another PART of what we're building at Uncaged Clinician and want you to be a part of.

Hi all I had a question for anyone who has worked with private schools in the past. I was approached with an opportunity and asked to work with a local school working at some of their games being more of an athletic trainer, but also providing some physical therapy skills in terms of working with coaches and student athletes on rehab exercises following injury. The athletic director asked me to send over what my hourly rate would be so that they could talk to their school administration about it and I need help because I really want this position but don’t want to undervalue my services. Has anyone worked in this scenario before and what was a fair price to charge. ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would be very cautious to practice within your scope of practice. In PA, PTs have lost their license because of practicing as a ATC.  You need to be a “first responder “ and be certified in emergency care as a minimum.  Lots of liability issues. My company has many school contracts but we use ATCs (then PTs as needed for post injury treatment ). We also have PTs but they are ATCs too.

> **Response 2:** Thank you for the input on this! I’m in Colorado and I had told the AD that I wanted to look into the state laws as to what I can and cannot do and specified that I was not an athletic trainer but rather a PT but that were allowed to do splinting/ taping ankles, assess concussion, and assess acute injury as well as give ice for injuries etc

Does anyone here have any experience writing up a business proposal working with a club sport for high school students? And how did you determine your pricing?
Background: I have the opportunity to work with a volleyball club that I actually used to play for when I was in high school and have contacted the club director about providing PT/wellness services to the club’s players. Initially, I would do an injury screen to at least 1/4 of the players and give them 1-2 exercises if the screen came back positive for anything concerning. There is also the possibility of me providing 5-15 minutes of manual therapy to the players 1x/week during their regular practices. Both of these services would be paid for by the club and if any family/player wanted to hire me separately then that would be covered by the family/player.
Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you can... leave time out of it...   

For example don't say $30 for 15 min...

Base it on $300  to cover etc

Or.    $300 a day.  Or. $300 to serve 30 kids

make it about you being available, not just in doing

Make sense?!?

> **Response 2:** A point of reference: my daughter charges 50 per kid for 55 min OH hitting 2-4 kids , another defense trainer 1:1 45 min lesson $60-70. They all do conditioning training on the side 2X week at $25 session in groups of usually 5

Hi! I’m looking for a PT that does dry needling in Saint George, Utah. A client of mine lives there part time and responds well to that modality. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You might try the PT clinic near G.O.A.T. in the Linns parking lot near dinosaur crossing. I believe he is an outpatient PT with dry needling certification.

Those with experience with True Coach, would it be a good option for HEP creation? I’d also like to create various Prehab type programs for patients. 

Pros and cons of true coach as an option? Any other app suggestions? Seems pretty reasonable at $25ish per month!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I loooove Everfit. I tried truecoach but creating habits and tracking metrics was not as straightforward

> **Response 2:** I have used Truecoach in the past and now using Everfit. I like it a lot, has all the features of Truecoach and more for a lower price. Allows for tracking of specific metrics, outcome measures, habit formation, reminders, 2-way communication. Brand new to it, so I’m still sorting out links and finding that it doesn’t have some exercises, but I found that with Truecoach too. It’s very easy to create a new exercise though and link to YouTube videos etc.

Question for the cash based Pelvic PTs. 

Looking into the cash based model for pelvic health.  I live in a wealthy populated area with lots of potential for cash business. 

My initial research on current cashed based pelvic businesses is indicating that a lot of the clientele using cashed based pelvic PT are young athletic prenatal and postnatal clients, Cross fitters, marathon runners, triathletes, etc.  

Do cash based pelvic PT’s see many older/menopausal women with pelvic floor dysfunction manifesting as dyspareunia/constipation/fecal incontinence/urinary incontinence?  
I have built an excellent reputation with local primary care and specialist MDs working with this client base over several years.  I know when I go cash based those MD referrals may drop off.   I want to be realistic about whether or not the older clients I excel with will go for cash based pelvic services.  

Any input is appreciated! 

Posting anonymously so as not to alert my current employer. (Still caged)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think a lot will depend on if there are good pelvic PTs in the area who do take insurance.

> **Response 2:** I am a pelvic PT and while mostly cash based, I am participating with Medicare and offer to check out of network benefits for others. It only deters some older clients.

Hello!
I have a medicare patient who i have been seeing for a left ankle fracture, she has now seen a different doctor and received a second script for a different right knee injury. As a provider can I treat her for both injuries on the same day and keep her for an hour and a half and get paid on both cases? The patient wants to know if she needs to see a different provider so she can receive treatment 2 days a week for her knee and 2 days a week for her ankle. The only problem is i am currently open 3 days a week, so i would need to see her one of the days for both appointments if she stayed with me. Would medicare reimburse me for both knee and ankle cases separately? They come from two different doctors and injuries.
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Anthony Maritato speaks about charging for the 2nd body part, but keep it all in one case. Tony, am I correct with this?

> **Response 2:** Do a re-evaluation, in the assessment explain why that the re-evaluation was done which is to update the plan of care to include the new condition which requires it's own POC/eval. The re-eval is going to update current s,o, and a, add new goals, update old goals, add a new plan. 

On treatment days, you're going to get reimbursed on what you did and how you treated. At that point it's no different than if they had walked in with both problems at the same time. You may need to extend treatment time, but you don't need to add a treatment day unless you want to.

**Original Post:**
HELP! I'm in Ohio for reference. I am going thru the practice act, but it is so unclear to me. 

I am a certified manual therapist and that is a big part of the way I practice. I'm still a bit confused as to my place in this therapy / wellness world. I have a fully cash practice, no insurance. If I see somebody and do any sort of manual therapy corrections of the spine or pelvis or anything like that does it automatically make it physical therapy instead of wellness? If so, do I need to have a plan of care in place in their chart? For wellness, I just do it "as needed". People seem to really like the flexibility of coming when they want and are using me effectively. However, I want to be in compliance with our state practice act, and have my malpractice insurance cover me. Generally, many of my wellness patients are one-time monthly. Since that is the case, doing a progress note every 30 days does not make sense. I'm doing more "maintenance" work. However, during those sessions, I often use manual therapy ( manipulation, joint mobs, soft tissue work, dry needling, etc.) to get them aligned so that they're exercises are more effective. 
Can someone speak to these things? Can I do whatever they need if they are paying for a service, or am I operating outside our practice act? If all I need is a plan of care, I can add that easily. If I have to send to Dr, I think it's a bigger deal just because I don't see individual patients with a high frequency. I'm more of a maintenance program.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If fully cash, why would you need notes at all or any sort of plan of care except as a reminder for you for the next session? No electronic record, no HIPPA. Assuming your malpractice is as a PT.

> **Response 2:** I prefer to think of wellness as “could a personal trainer legally do this?” So I would not dry needle or manipulate a patient that I’m seeing for wellness. A massage therapist, those places that stretch people, etc. - those don’t require an MD Rx, providing exercise plan doesn’t require an Rx. So I would look more into what your practice act specifically puts under the term personal trainer and also what it says specifically about dry needling and manipulation.

I made a 10 minute video of stretches to do with one of my patients so she would have a short video to follow at home.  Follow it along and make these breathing and stretching exercises part of your morning. 
For you or the patients you treat.

Thought I’d share it because it can be a great little work out covering many muscles in the entire body. 
Some of the motions are good for nerve gliding, and overalll joint stretching.
Enjoy!

Hi guys. 

I'm wondering who gives the BEST Dry Needling Courses/Certs especially for the Pelvic region (my main reason for going)?

Apparently, it looks like I need 40hrs of academic and 40hrs of hands on instruction in order to practice DN in my state. So it looks like  getting the certification is the way to go.

Any thoughts on this would be helpful?

Thanks in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m certified through Myopain Seminars…. I thought they did a fantastic job! To get certified it was 3 3day weekend courses.  To learn the pelvic floor would be additional on top of that.

> **Response 2:** I did mine through Evidence in Motion, used to be Kinetacore. They have Functional Dry Needling level 1(2-3 days)you then have to do 100 sessions before you can do level 2(2-3 days). They have a pelvic floor dry needling course but it requires level 1 and 200+ sessions I believe. I’m a huge fan, I think it’s a safer approach than others I’ve seen but I kind of boils down to this: if you want a faster more condensed course, go with another company. If you don’t mind taking the time to learn it all, 100% do this one.

Need guidance for a certification:

Does anyone know if there is a nutrition certification that offers good clinical application and possibly also counts towards as CEUs for our license?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Brian, what do you mean by clinical application? Where you can actually practice the skills you learn?

> **Response 2:** Hey! I'm based in VA. I know CEU requirements vary state to state. Fortunately VA is pretty easy going. I took the ISSA nutrition coaching certification course. Great base information to utilize in a general clinical sense and also added a revenue stream to my business (that paid for itself in my first nutrition client).

I do know there is a Nutrition as Medicine course by PESI. I did look into it, and have heard good things, but decided I wanted to actually become a certified nutrition coach for the added revenue stream opportunity stated above vs just more information to apply clinically.

How did you deal with imposter syndrome at the beginning? I’m just starting my own business (have 5 years of PT experience)  and don’t feel like my services are worth charging prices I see on here for treatment/eval. I worry I don’t know enough/wont help my patients the same all on my own. Is this normal or am I not ready if I feel this way?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started my company with less experience than you (1 year in my own business right now).  For whatever it's worth- I had similar concerns, so I did a lot of self reflection regarding what I'd treat. What conditions do you treat that you feel you can treat better than the average PT? Market your business towards that. Get a patient with a condition you don't feel confident in? Refer them elsewhere. That's what I did, helped me feel so much better being in business by myself. 

That being said, don't rest on only treating only things you like- identify your weaknesses and work on them. Take awesome continuing education courses - they are a business expense now too!

> **Response 2:** Something that helped me when I was in PT school was even if you don’t know everything you know more than your patient. Sometimes the simplest things make a huge difference in their life. Also, it gets better with experience (from the business and cash side). I used to feel guilty with a $150/hr charge but now I won’t accept less than $185 and might even consider raising those within the year. You get people who want to be there and get helped by you. You’re totally ready. Just be confident in what you do not and hold yourself responsible for what you don’t and keep learning. You got this!

Hello, I am a vestibular PTA . I was wondering if any PTS would like to tag team on cash pay virtual vestibular rehab.

**Original Post:**
Good morning everyone. Does someone have experience working with patients after peroneal tendons repair? I have patient who had repair done many years ago and his main complaint is not being able to do SL calf raise on the surgical side along with instability. I researched some articles about peroneal tendon repair which were mostly case reports written by MDs and they reported "good" or "great" outcomes with no other details. Is there any possibility that those patients will never be able to do full calf raise on the surgical side?

My patient is 40-year-old personal trainer who is very active and exercise on daily basis.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you for all the comments! So after my eval here are some important takeaways: 1. Pt did "rehab" by himself (due to various reasons). Personally I think this is where the problem stems from. He did some exercises but I believe he did not have proper and progressive progression, as well as other set of eyes to see if he is developing compensations. 2. I learned from surgical report that his ankle was fused due to instability (ATFL and CFL) as well as his peroneus brevis was used to reconstruct the longus. 3. Based on my objective eval I deduct not only severe weakness in triceps surae complex but also in flexor digitorum longus (MMT of toes 2-5th are maybe 4-/5 at best). 4. During SL and DL heel raise pt demo'es ankle supination which looks like dominance coming form tibialis anterior and posterior . Thus my plan is to do progressive strengthening of triceps surae etc. I showed pt mobo board  but I recommended doing custom modification to have digits 2-5th do the work, not 1st ray, on top of other strengthening exercises. I plan to sprinkle in exer such as toe yoga so pt is able to learn dissociation between his 5 digits 🙂 TLDR: all we need to do is progressive overloading!

> **Response 2:** I’ve seen a few of them for post-op rehab. They all did well and were able to do SL calf raises by d/c with pretty symmetrical excursion to non-operative side.

Favorite in service/ free education class topics?! Would be a free 30 minute or less at a local personal training facility

Soreness vs pain? 
Posture? 
Lifting mechanics?
Targeted body part info (knee/ shoulder etc)?

I have only done one years ago for gymnasts so totally different demographic and really want to get my brain jogged on truly good topics and what im allowed to discuss in a free workshop like that. Obviously cant diagnose or treat individual issues - need a general topic to educate on! Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unsolicited advice since these are what blew up my mobile gig. You can position yourself as the expert that can solve their pain point no matter the issue. My favorite presentation pitch is: 
Clarity: identify exactly what you are talking about 
Authority: why you
Problem: identify it 
Solution: what it will take 
The why: why you are passionate or why there is the problem
Opportunity: what they have the chance to be part of 
Next steps: how they can engage with you 
Essence: the feelings you want the to leave with 
Capstone framework. Just pitch them with confidence

> **Response 2:** I usually ask the gym owner or head coach/personal trainer for ideas.  They most likely can tell you 2-3 things their clients complain of or would be interested in.

Has anyone taken an accounting class that really helped their practice? I am looking into something like this on Coursera but would love to know of any others you may recommend!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got my MBA and MS in healthcare admin which had several accounting classes in it. Most of them are more relevant for larger health systems not smaller private practices. A bookkeeping or a managerial accounting class may be a bit more applicable but honestly there’s probably better ways to educate yourself. 

A Finance class could be helpful  for not only your business but your personal finances as well. The best bang for your buck for your practice will probably be a marketing or operations class.

> **Response 2:** I got a MBA and the actual accounting class was the least helpful.

California PTs…do we need any personal training certifications to be able to do personal training/performance/wellness coaching? I read our practice act and it sounds like it’s within our scope of practice 🤷🏻‍♂️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Luke, I am a PT and also a registered yoga instructor. I practice in MD but went to school in Cali so I’m somewhat familiar with the practice act there. I would say this is mostly a liability issue. We can never truly take our “PT hat” off even when training folks/ teaching group exercise. However, it does help to have a separate cert to help distinguish those services from your other PT work. So I’d suggest getting a NASM CPT or CSCS depending on your population. I’m currently studying for CSCS for this exact reasoning for when my yoga clients want to do more performance training with me.

> **Response 2:** I'm a CA PT. It definitely is within our scope of practice, but I also maintain my CSCS, just to cover all bases and help distinguish sports performance training from physical therapy services.

Hi,I am a newbie, recently started my practice as pelvic PT and I have subleased a treatment room. I don't have hydrocollator yet but want to explore options what I can use. It's a little out of budget right now to buy one. Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pelvic pt here.. a question for thought.. Why do you think you need a hydrocollator?

> **Response 2:** Totally can wait. Not worth the expense, space or upkeep in my opinion -especially if just starting out. 

Can you do the Medibeads that can be heated in a microwave or an electric hot pack like the one posted? 

We use hot packs very infrequently but patients do like the slight weight of the medibeads on their abdomen when we have used them and many times we just encourage them to buy one for home use so we can prioritize our in clinic time for other things they can’t do on their own. 

My approach might be slightly different though because I’m in insurance based clinic so we are limited to 45 to 60 minutes for appointments so I usually defer heat or ice so I can do more hands-on techniques or supervised exercises. ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m sure you know this and will address but for the sake of anyone else who needs to hear it I think we are missing the picture here! A 10 year old playing 5 sports. Missed opportunity if we don’t pause and educate the parents and the child and give them the valuable opportunity to give their body a rest to heal. Regardless of needling. Emotionally and physically this is hard on the body at 10. We are in a unique position to have these conversations and help possibly change the trajectory moving forward for this child. Probably not, but we must try to promote some balance and help children at a young age pay attention to their bodies in a good way! Good luck with that conversation and remember we got people better before needling was a thing. Maybe at a young age we go old school?

How do you best help your patients with HEP compliance? Besides talking to them about the importance/how they won’t get better just seeing me 1x per week/helping them come up with a time in their day. I know it varies patient to patient. What has worked best for you?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ask them how much time they are willing to commit to the hep during the eval. Then give them a clear understanding of how they’ll progress based on that. And yes definitely incorporate into daily activities. Also discuss their why during the eval to improve compliance

> **Response 2:** What is their barrier to not doing? Sometimes we overcomplicate things for patients and they feel overwhelmed. Maybe identify 2-3 things most important to them and mimic that in the exercises. If they don’t feel they’re valuable to meet their goals, it doesn’t matter what we say or how great the exercises are. My favorite saying is the best exercise program is one that patients are willing and able to do🤷🏼‍♀️🤣 
There are some apps/websites that track compliance also

Hey guys!

I apologize if this has been asked or if this is waaaay off, but...

Any uncaged OTs working with the pediatric population? There's a HUGE gap in pediatric coverage in my rural area. I would likely need to be come a Medicaid provider as well, and haven't actually researched it super deeply yet. I have all the ideas and want to do all the things (everything from traditional to specialized to community based) and just don't have them narrowed down yet.

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I know several PP OTs in Pediatrics. What area of the US?

> **Response 2:** Yes we are in Illinois!

**Original Post:**
First of MANY nervous posts, I am sure...A shared space recently popped up as a very affordable option to light a fire for starting to have my own practice. (I am excited and nervous, and my husband is very skeptical).
It is happening very fast. My original plan was to cut my hours at work starting in July to start the process but now the timeline is greatly accelerated to May 1. 
1. My specialties are Balance/Vestibular and Aquatic- are there Aquatic therapists here that have been successful renting pool time from condos or hotels?
2. As far as a name goes does "The Nerdy PT" sound off-putting? Would it be a deterrent for the Geriatric population?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Idk about pools, but make some calls to places local to you. 
Not liking the name Nerdy PT. Why Nerdy? Is there math involved? Nerds to me are computer oriented, not physical.

> **Response 2:** Renting pool time in condos or hotels will be iffy bc of liability issues. Your better off renting from a privately owned pool.

Can someone point me in the right direction or correct me if I’m wrong? I have a patient who I’ve been seeing (Med B )for most of the year for treatment in the home. He had surgery in July on his knee (TKA) and I was under the impression I had to stop treatment since I had been working shoulders/neck and LEs as well. 

A local private PT company I’ve partnered with told me that he can have multiple POC at the same time as long as it is different body parts. I sent same patient recently for some neuropathy treatment at another clinic (hospital based OP) but they wouldn’t see him and almost forced him to do all his PT with them. I did a Google search for information on this and didn’t find what I was looking for. Anyone have any experience with this or know who is right in this situation?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Only one per day.  Medicare won’t pay for PT on two different POC on the same day.

> **Response 2:** They can have multiple open POC, you just don’t want them to overlap and double schedule on the same day 

Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group is a good resource for questions like this 😊

I’m looking for a home adjustable exercise stair step platform that has side rails for someone older to hold on to so they don’t lose their balance.

Does such a thing exist? Would it be a separate purchase from the stair stepper maybe? 

Like the photo below but with side hand rails.

Where to purchase?

Thanks in advance.

**Community Responses:**

For those whose clients pay cash do you get an order from the MD for dry needling? 

For those who go through insurance and already have a script, do you get an additional script for dry needling?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in montana. No specific dry needling referral. You are the expert- if PT is indicated then you get to make your best clinical judgement if it’s indicated. The only possible exception may be to touch base with surgeon if it is post op to make sure you maintain a good working relationship (if he sends you tons of referrals but hates or doesn’t understand  needling, for instance)

> **Response 2:** I believe insurance doesn't cover dry needling anyway? And in Colorado, I don't ask for a referral for anything. Ever. I'm cash pay. It's probably different in other states

He doesn’t mind paying cash, however wants his “money worth”.

Any recommendations for myofascial cupping courses. Ones that especially go over evidence based benefits, techniques, safety. 

Since I have a set I use on myself, I thought of incorporating it into my own practice.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I highly recommend taking an FDM course through the American Fascial Distortion Model Association (AFDMA). Cupping is one of the FDM treatments, but an FDM course will help you more effectively apply cupping as well as delivering ridiculously significant and rapid results for several other patient concerns (check out the testimonial videos on my business FB or Instagram page for examples.)

> **Response 2:** If you have Medbridge, there are three courses on there ￼

Happy Sunday uncaged friends!!
I’m looking for info on how much a certified Pilates instructor might expect to be paid/ going rate?

I have one reformer now, so am considering hiring someone to do private classes when the clinic isn’t otherwise used, and perhaps expanding to 2 reformers in the future (semi private classes).

I’ve searched online, but I’ve also done that for physical therapy and the numbers can be way off in both directions.
Thanks!
(I’m in a small/ medium sized city in Florida)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Certified by what body? I hold comprehensive certification for mat and apparatus through Balanced Body and charge $75-80 for a private session. $110-$120 for duet. Really depends on the quality/education/experience of the instructor. There are some crap “certifications” out there. And I’m in Honolulu, but when I was on the mainland there wasn’t a significant difference in pay.

> **Response 2:** Christa Gurka would be your person on this.

Any lymphedema therapist here? I am trying to check if an American certification is mandatory or not. 
I am a foreign born PT and took an extremely comprehensive certification in my home country. I worked with it for a while too. Ive been a PT in USA for 10 years now and have not worked with it since. I am going back home for the summer and considering retaking certification. It is 1/2 off to retake, and when you convert our currency, 8-1, retaking it would cost me only $300. I am trying to decide if it is worth it though… if I can work with it when I come back, sure. If wont count because it is not an American certification, then I may just not.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am! While is not mandatory, I will say it makes things tremendously easier and more informative. For example, MDs are more likely to refer if you're a CLT than not.

> **Response 2:** If you want to get referrals most people and doctors are going to ask if you certified.  It's not mandatory but highly recommended. Recommend ACOLS, Nortons, Klose or Ilwti

**Original Post:**
How would someone become a provider to offer continuing education credits to participants/students for a private company?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you’re providing continuing education to therapists, you need to look up the requirements for each discipline on their state board website. There can be a lot of specific requirements to meet and paperwork on your background and they usually want your CV and often a sample certificate that you plan to issue to your students. You’ll also need a detailed itinerary of your course to submit. Each state and each board within a state have different requirements and fees to pay to become an approved provider for a course. Another option is to become an AOTA approved provider, which is more intensive a process, but then you wouldn’t have to apply through each state to provide your course to OTs, for example.

> **Response 2:** It’s state by state dependent, and once you are initially credentialed for the one course, some states have further credentialing where all of your courses can be pre-approved (as a CEU provider) but there are generally a few more steps including all educator’s CVs and research that is used to teach etc

Hey everyone! Holding my first workshop at a dance studio in a little over a month. Do you have workshop attendees and/or the business owner of the place that's hosting the workshop sign anything in advance? I plan to have a "sign in" sheet with people to leave their contact info, but not sure if there should be any consent or written agreement signed, too. 

Finally, any tips on hosting an interactive workshop without PowerPoint or use of electronics would be greatly appreciated! Haven't done public speaking in quite some time😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Emily, I've been doing workshops since 2018 on various topics. I stay clear of ppt or any other electronic tools. I make a handout for everyone with a question that they can fill in as you go along. Use an attendee as a demo to show exactly what you do. You can sometimes pick out someone who might be a 5-minute miracle, but don't count on that being your closer. The closer should be a call to action without sounding like a used car salesman. Collect names and emails to build your distribution list. I always found 12--15 a good sweet spot for attendance. Much more it will lose it's intimacy. Less than 10 make it more personable for each person. Are you charging? Are you capping attendance? Not sure what you are doing or what state you live in, but doubt you need any sort of release. Sorry for throwing all this out there. Happy to chat- DM me

Has anyone looked into becoming a practitioner for @classpass

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** From what i understand they are looking for bulk discounts. I spoke with the yoga studio owner where I did the event last week and he brought them up. I wouldn't offer PT services because the way it is is setup, the more you charge, the less likely members will use their points to come to you. You are paid by ClassPass and they assign a # of points to your service. It's more for any wellness stuff you might want to offer

> **Response 2:** Class pass is for fitness classes. We used it for our Pilates studio to bring folks in the door and then let them know about all of our services. I would pick up one PT client every month or two from class pass folks taking Pilates classes. We did cancel recently as it just wasn’t paying enough to make it worth it. Precovid it was a good lead gen magnet but since not so much.

I have 2 patients (husband and wife) who I currently see and are relocating to Huntsville, Alabama.  I do dry needling for the wife in her cervical and thoracic region, as well as other manual techniques (dynamic cupping, SO release, cervical distraction) plus postural exercises.  The husband does not get any manual treatments and instead does strengthening, balance and gait training.  If you are a mobile PT in that area who can do the treatments stated above and are interested in taking them on, please PM me.  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following so I can learn who the mobile therapists are in my home town. 💯

(If none turn up, Nesin Therapy Services is a private practice that could accommodate both those approaches. Just brick and mortar.)

Outpatient care will grow 18% by 2033, well ahead of the expected 2% rise in inpatient care.

Question for Georgia PTs doing cash based dry needling:

If you are treating patients cash only, what are you doing regarding sending a POC to their MD prior to needling? It doesn't seem necessary for most wellness services,  but how do you tip-toe the line regarding the GA practice act in reference to the requirements to perform needling, "Has consulted with an individual licensed
pursuant to Article 2 or 4 of Chapter 34 of
Title 43"

I have been asked several times to needle the 20-40 year old, athletic population, but these people are overall healthy and most don't even have a regular MD. Would love to drop by for a quick, self-pay needling session. Just wondering what others do or would advise in this situation?

The VA covered dry needling but they barely paid anything. Enough to barely cover the needles we used.

We are in network with the VA so do we have to bill them the dry needling? Or can we just tell the patient we will not submit that and it will be self pay for the dry needling?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You have to check your contract. I’ve read in the past that if you are contracted with an insurance it is against the contract to make someone pay cash for covered services

> **Response 2:** Yes, you have to bill the VA. You cannot charge them cash for covered services if you are in network with the VA.

Hi my fellow clinicians,

I was contacted to give a presentation at 55+ community clubhouse especially for tennis ball/pickle ball/golf players ……

I have definitely worked with patients playing these sports and guided them well but I have never done a presentation for general info  and to educate them on ways I could help them. 

I would love to hear some ideas from people who have done it.

So far I am thinking :
-Flyer with basic education 
-Talk about muscle imbalance , posture, tennis elbow, prevention techniques, KT taping techniques etc.

Any further guidance on this is highly appreciated.🙏🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would provide a hand out on favorite post match exercises that focuses on decreasing those muscle imbalances. I think on mine I put child pose, upper trunk rotations, piriformis stretches, sleeper stretch. I agree on education focusing on hip, shoulder and thoracic mobility to help improve their games.

> **Response 2:** For geriatric golfers specifically I would work on hip and shoulder/thoracic mobility and strength. For a short part of a presentation I’d just say “low back pain in golf can be helped by getting a little more strength and flexibility in your hips > (insert how you would do it) > caution that it’s not the only thing that could contribute to low back pain and if they want a more thorough assessment you are happy to see them. Short and sweet, but as a golf focused PT I work on the hips for almost every patient

I worked with someone today who was vacationing near me and said he went to an in-network place near him and when he convinced them to do some hands out work, he got about 8 min. He is an engineer, super diligent with his exercises and could use some more hands on assist. Hoping I can give him some ideas of ppl to get in touch with when he returns home in a couple of weeks. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

I have had luck calling private gym clinics and chiropractor offices but I think an assisted living facility would be ideal as I like treating the elderly population. Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think you could just call the ALF and ask to meet with them. At mtg ask what other PT provides. Maybe u have a specialty they don't. 
Or offer upfront to charge 15% less for treatment and see if they will contract with you

Question for my fellow sports orthopedic therapists. Do you have a court shoe recommendation for pickleball? She is wide width with mild midfoot pronation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** New Balance, Brooks, Hoka, Asics just something she is comfortable in. Usually going shoe shopping when the feet are tired is good, and wear them around for 20 mins to determine how they feel if they are as supportive, and not rubbing anywhere. Some running stores have a treadmill inside the store to try them. Some pts we get from the podiatrist will get custom orthotics, it varies on if it helps, some take about 6 weeks. Usually a wear program few hours a day until they get used to the custom inserts. They could also get an over the counter set as needed.

> **Response 2:** I don't love Hokas for court sports since there is less lateral stability because of the rocker bottom. Those really are best only for walking and running.

Good morning!
I have a new patient who is with MC, but would like to come to my clinic for Dry Needling.  None of the in-network clinics in our area offer this service, and I believe either way it is a non-covered service by MC.

Any advice for how to go about providing her with this treatment, or any phrases that you use to CYA?  I am assuming phrasing it as wellness and Dry Needling?

So far I have no experience with "wellness," but just calling things physical therapy.  I know it's a fuzzy line that has been discussed here a lot.

Thank you so much in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For a while MC was covering acupuncture not sure if they are again/still are. I know it's not considered the same, but if they are on a budget. Some states DN is still grey or not covered with insurances. So the pt would be charged a fee for DN after a consent form was presented. More if they weren't already a patient. $30 vs $60. Adds up when they want multiples visits for the desired effect.

> **Response 2:** Google an abn form. Fill it out with section d. Dry needling. Should be good to go.

I have a friend in late 50s that has L sided neck pain. Has tried both conventional PT (with another clinic) which included dry needling.  Still has significant pain with turning his head to the L. Imaging reported significant spondylosis. Was going to have surgery, but surgeon then reported that he does not think it will help. They are on multiple medications to help manage pain but despite these medications, he still cannot turn his head to the L and is in a constant state of pain. 
Any other suggestions that I can offer to this person for pain management? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Need more info regarding physical assessment. What is the suspected pain generator and what were positive special tests? Are there radicular symptoms and/or involvement of the shoulder? Also wondering if part of your post got left out - what other interventions have been tried thus far beyond DN? 

Agree with above regarding facet assessment/mobilization, facilitation. Should also check upper thoracic rotation and 1st rib mobility. 

Regarding the DN and any other manual intervention, not worth much of not followed by active intervention. If all has been assessed and appropriate intervention performed, may look at pain psych. Wondering the timeline of all this as well.

> **Response 2:** How much ROM does he have to the L?…I usually let that guide my treatment (upper, mid, lower cervical)…mulligan mobs with movement can be very helpful bc then you can teach them to self mob= more carryover.

Was I the only PT wishing for a “BB-8” drone following me and my pt during every session, from IE to Dix, documenting POC and daily notes, improving my quality of work-life balance and being diligent to pt’s progress or lack of it, in writing?

Doubt it. I think there are many of us. 

I am very interested in AI scribes for PT. Started looking around a couple of weeks ago. Had a zoom-intro session with one of the AI Scribe companies.

Here is a video that I found helpful in summarizing what AI scribe could do for a clinician.

Maybe you’d find it helpful too.

Need clinical advice:
I am treating a patient that has developed spasticity due to CAR T treatment. He’s cured from cancer however it gave him neurotoxicity. He was sent to me with symptoms of Parkinsonism. 
Due to severe spasticity his knees are locked at 40-50 degrees flexion. Wife states that at night he’s able to get better range. 
Does any know how I can work with something like this? Any recommendations on BL knee extension brace for extended stretch. Would that help?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m working with a gentleman who has primitive reflexes after a brain injury. You may find your patient’s knees extend when he extends his neck. That is probably what happens when he lays down. If so, then go back to the basics of integration. It is working for me.

> **Response 2:** I’m writing in solidarity, as this has been heavy on my PT mind lately. I just lost a close family member last week (previously healthy and super active) to neurotoxicity and related side effects of this treatment. His team said some symptoms were Parkinsonian-like. Terrible, unfortunate loss. While I was hoping he would pull through, my PT brain kept fast-forwarding to the rehab stage and knew he’d need some super creative and perceptive neuro PTs on his side.  So sad for my family. I sure hope more research and discussion emerges on this topic.

Hi everyone! I’m a pediatric PT and a certified massage therapist in CA. I’m interested in doing in-home massages and not any in-home PT (for now). Anyone have any idea how this might work if I want to keep these two lines of work separate legally speaking? Yet I do want to share that I am also a DPT to showcase my background. Thanks! 🙏🏼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My question to you is why you want to separate it if you’re providing massage therapy?

Is it because you don’t want to do anything other than massage/MT? Or because you don’t want to do rehab? Or something else?

(I’m in California and a rehabilitation therapist ( unlicensed since there is no state license here. 🤷🏻‍♀️) I personally provide movement and active manual therapy but my clinic offers straight massage as part of our services)

Your PT license covers manual therapy and as long as your clients understand your services with them will not be PT, where do you see the concern?

> **Response 2:** Market and sell massage therapy services. 

When you share about yourself you can speak about your education as a selling point. 

If you really want to ensure the separation, you can speak with an attorney to put language in your consent forms stating, this is not physical therapy.

2) Can a cash pay PT treat Medicare patients for free as a community service (since you cannot charge for treatment)?

**Community Responses:**

Hi everyone and Happy Father's day to all the dads!! We have been asked to provide presurgical consult/education session for an orthopedic spine center for  patients with info such as what equipment they could need following surgery, orthopedic precautions, etc. Does anyone know how this could be billed ? The practices are wanting to do a standard evaluation but not all of the patients will attend PT at the clinics where the educational sessions are provided due to not living in the same area. Any insight is greatly appreciated, I am located in FL.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Eval and treatment for whatever education you proved (probably therapeutic activity or ther ex)

> **Response 2:** I would think this would be eval + patient education,  not ther ex or ther act unless you are documenting impairments and going through actually exercises.

Just need a little refresh. Medicare patients need a progress note 30 days or 30 days re-assessment?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As of 2008 a POC can be certified up to 90 days.  the 30 day requirement ended Dec 31 2007. Source CMS chapt 15 page 171.

C.  Review of Plan and Recertification Reference:  42CFR424.24(c), 1861(r), 42CFR 410.61(e). The timing of recertification changed on January 1, 2008.  Certifications signed on or after January 1, 2008, follow the rules in this section.  Certifications signed on or prior to December 31, 2007, follow the rule in effect at that time, which required recertification every 30 calendar days. Payment and coverage conditions require that the plan must be reviewed, as often as necessary but at least whenever it is certified or recertified to complete the certification requirements.  It is not required that the same physician/NPP who participated initially in recommending or planning the patient’s care certify and/or recertify the plans. Recertifications that document the need for continued or modified therapy should be signed whenever the need for a significant modification of the plan becomes evident, or at least every 90 days after initiation of treatment under that plan, unless they are delayed.

> **Response 2:** Progress Notes every 10th visit..  looking for source reference.  pg 184
Progress Reports (including Discharge Notes, if applicable) when records are requested after the reports are due.  (See definitions in section 220 and descriptions in 220.3 D); 

pg 191: 
D.  Progress Report The progress report provides justification for the medical necessity of treatment. Contractors shall determine the necessity of services based on the delivery of services as directed in the plan and as documented in the treatment notes and progress report.  For Medicare payment purposes, information required in progress reports shall be written by a clinician that is, either the physician/NPP who provides or supervises the services, or by the therapist who provides the services and supervises an assistant.  It is not required that the referring or supervising physician/NPP sign the progress reports written by a PT, OT or SLP. Timing.  The minimum progress report period shall be at least once every 10 treatment days.  The day beginning the first reporting period is the first day of the episode of treatment regardless of whether the service provided on that day is an evaluation, reevaluation or treatment.  Regardless of the date on which the report is actually written (and dated), the end of the progress report period is either a date chosen by the clinician or the 10th treatment day, whichever is shorter.  The next treatment day begins the next reporting period.  The progress report period requirements are complete when both the elements of the progress report and the clinician’s active participation in treatment have been documented. For example, for a patient evaluated on Monday, October 1 and being treated five times a week, on weekdays:  On October 5, (before it is required), the clinician may choose to write a progress report for the last week’s treatment (from October 1 to October 5).  October 5 ends the reporting period and the next treatment on Monday, October 8 begins the next reporting period.  If the clinician does not choose to write a report for the next

Are there any PT schools that are especially good at hand therapy?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you mean continuing education companies? Or actual PT degree schools? PT school doesn't generally have a focus in one area. We learn a little of everything in a well rounded all-inclusive education,  learn some more specifics during internships and then usually specialties come later with continued education.

> **Response 2:** I remember at Columbia they had a volunteer trip to South America to do hand therapy with poor communities. The students got to do a lot of hands on work. But… did I find the coursework on hand therapy that great? No, I am sure you can learn the same thing at another program or buy some books and learn on your own. My suggestion would be to go to the cheapest DPT program, set up your own  clinical rotation at a clinic with a PT that specializes in hand therapy and has that patient caseload. You can seek out your own volunteer and learning opportunities at any program. Then when you graduate yogi will have less debt and more cash funds to take hand therapy continuing education classes. I am sure you could also find a hand therapy PT residency, but IMO residencies with lower salaries are predatory. You are basically doing more work by studying, doing an A+ job for less money and I call bullshit.

those who create courses what platform do you use? Please describe its pros and cons.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m currently using Heights Platform because I got a lifetime deal from AppSumo. (They have lots of deals — beware of the FOMO marketing they use that makes you want to buy everything 😜) 

It’s good-enough for my first course and learning without having to pay monthly. 

Eventually I’d like an all in one platform that incorporates the email marketing, course and website… but cost is guiding my choice currently. 🙂 

Just remember you’ll also need a good sales funnel to actually sell any courses. 

AND the biggest mistake I see is therapists making a course they *think* people want and need without digging into what the audience actually needs. 

So make sure you ask your audience what they’d like to see.

Hello everyone! I am a Physical Therapist in Florida right now and recently applied and got my LLC to start my own business, but we are moving for an unknown amount of time to Washington D.C. As of right now, I am not planning to get my physical therapy license there but would like to see people under the umbrella of wellness still. I have my STOTT Pilates certification and am a certified life coach. I did have my NASM Personal Training certificate a long time ago but let it lapse when I became a PT. How can I do this, legally? Is there anything extra I need to do or be cautious of? How do I or can I market myself when people ask? If we do end up staying longer, I would probably get my license in Virginia and join the PT COMPACT but as of now, DC is not part of the compact so, I’m curious about how I could offer wellness services in DC, but PT in Virginia, Maryland, etc? 

This is confusing, but I’ve let that get in my way too long! Thanks

> **Response 1:** I've offered wellness for years. Above is correct. Also any forms before working w a client should clearly state this is not PT, it's wellness. There's not much else. Get an insurance plan or if you have just add wellness/training to it, it's cheap.

> **Response 2:** My thoughts. You can advertise your degree of a DPT (no one can take that away) but call your services all wellness services. You can not say PT though bc that is what denotes a license in our PT, DPT credential. When I tried to report someone in Michigan calling themselves an athletic trainer who wasn't an athletic trainer the board said they could only discipline a clinician who was licensed. So overall if your offering wellness and not PT and not billing for it I would assume you have alot less restrictions.

Looking at affordable e stim units, and am leaning toward AWQ-104LT over the ES-130, simply because of the ability to go higher on pulse width (I’m interested if anyone has reasoning behind using the lower pulse width with the ES-130 if from what I recall higher tends to be better for motor stim and deep C-fibers??? I like to understand the why 🤷🏻‍♀️

With the AWQ though you can set polarity, and I need a refresher - how would you set that up with dry needling?

TIA

For those that work with Parkinson’s patients- how soon after a DBS surgery do you see them?

I thought it was a while- till the settings were determined but I had a patient call me today. She was cleared by her surgeon about 2.5 weeks after the surgery to start light therapy. Are there specific protocols I should be aware of? Just wanted to inquire or see others thoughts as I thought this was kind of soon, especially after a big surgery like this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Worked acute care for a while. We saw DBS post op same as anyone else to make sure they could return home safely. Curious what others will say, but my thought is that even if the settings are still needing adjusted and they don’t have it completely figured out yet, they still have to function at home and a fall would only impair their healing, so seeing them and helping them be safe and learn makes sense to me.

> **Response 2:** In outpatient we saw them pretty early on. Usually 1-2 weeks post. Surgeon obviously takes the lead but many of times they were very receptive to our opinion.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In treating this patient, it's crucial to move beyond the diagnosis of Polyneuropathy and focus on the individual's unique needs and impairments. Be sure to perform a thorough assessment of patient balance, sensory organization, proprioceptive awareness￼, and coordination as well as assess specific patient needs and goals. ￼

> **Response 2:** You have to assess and find out the impact and impairments. The diagnosis doesn't mean squat

What types of manuals do you have on hand for your cash based clinics should anyone ever come knocking? Is an OSHA, OIG, office procedure manual necessary? If so, how do you get them? Also, if you do dry needling, how do you dispose of sharps boxes once full? Do you need record every time you dispose of a sharps box?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sharps disposal depends on local city or county rules. Often if they lock, you can just toss them. Google specifics near you.

We’re a neuro PT/OT clinic. We’re going to do lunch and learn at a local ENT (for our vestibular therapist) and neurologist offices this month. Any suggestions of what to bring and how to structure it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used to work for a group of ENT's-- I was the director of their vestibular PT clinic.  What they want to hear is:

-Your vestibular PT knows what he/she is doing (certified in vestibular) and gets good results. 

-You get patients in quickly, especially the "emergency vertigo" cases.  Maybe even same day if they need you to.

-You have programs for treating their chronic vestibular diagnosed patients-- meniere's, vestibular migraine, etc.

-They'll also probably want to know what type of equipment you test and treat with (I.e. frenzel lenses, CATSIB platforms, etc).  You'll also want to show them anything special about your gym or space which makes it particularly "vestibular" in nature.

-And last but not necessarily specific to ENT's-- what insurances you take and how much it will cost their patients.

> **Response 2:** We always use a local Tex mex/Mexican restaurant & have them deliver to the office & set it up. They set up the taco bar & supply all the plates, napkins & cutlery. It’s an easy clean up!

Does anyone provide private aquatic services at
their local pools? I’m looking in to providing aquatic services at a local indoor hotel pool (sounds sketchy but it’s a high-end resort spa pool that is actually rarely used) and we also have mineral rich natural spring pools in my area that could possibly be used.  I’m literally just in the “thinking” stage and would need more training but wanted to get ideas/thoughts, what would I need to do? There are no aquatic Services in my area and I think it would be a good business just never went out on my own and don’t know what I’m doing!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used to treat kids at my outdoor pool club during the summers.  There are some liability issues you’ll have to address with the hotel and your liability insurance, but I loved it!

> **Response 2:** I did this and the only requirement was that the hotel/pool we used was on my general liability insurance plan. A practical concern was finding a place that had a warm enough water temp. We ended up using a cooler indoor hotel pool for one location and then renting time in a therapeutic pool at an aquatics center for a warmer temp. for specific patient populations.

ISO private PT in Palo Alto
I have a patient 52F who is moving to Palo Alto and looking for a private PT. She’s dealing with full body, chronic pain, especially at her neck, feet and hips. She works with rheumatology and neurology and doesn’t have a formal diagnosis for her pain (it’s not “radiculopathy” 🙄), but she fits the bill for chronic fatigue and in general is very hyper mobile with poor stability￼. 

Anyone here work in Palo Alto that focuses on 1:1 tx, manual therapy + really tailored therex?￼

**Original Post:**
I’m a pelvic floor PT starting my private practice and also work PRN 1 day a week at a local hospital. I am the only PF PT at this hospital and sometimes see PF patients there, though most of my caseload is ortho. The rehab director has told me that this hospital system sends all PF referrals outside of the hospital, since there is no PF PT (other than me) to evaluate these patients. Today I got a call at my private practice (yay Google SEO) from a nurse who is with a gastroenterologist at the same hospital where I work prn. She asked if I treat a certain diagnosis and I said yes, so she sent me the referral. 

She doesn’t know I work there PRN 1 day a week and the hospital doesn’t know I have my own private practice. I have never marketed my private practice to patients at this hospital. 

My question is, when is this a conflict of interest and what should I do in regards to my prn job and also trying to market my private practice separately? Should I just quit my prn job so that no lines get blurred?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The hospital I was working at when starting my practice said there was no conflict due to my prn status. 

They congratulated me on my venture. 
 
Just ask your compliance department

> **Response 2:** The hospital could consider is a conflict of interest as it would be difficult for them to know you aren’t marketing your private business to hospital patients. I would disclose it, but you could lose the prn job. I do inpatient prn and they know about my pelvic floor PT but no conflict there because the inpatient patients wouldn’t be my private practice patients.

> **Response 2:** I usually see Eval and 2 or 3 units as the biller

Hello Group.  Last year I started my mobile based PT business.  Most of my clients are older and are on Medicare.  I evaluated a client December 30, 2024 and saw them for a few visits after that.  The client had some personal obligations so PT was put on hold.  I just resumed seeing them but it has been over a month since their last visit.  Does Medicare REQUIRE a new evaluation for a patient that has not been seen for more than 30 days?  If Medicare does not require a new evaluation should I just do  a re-evaluation or a progress note.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can also do a progress note if it's the same diagnosis and update POC.

> **Response 2:** I would just do a re-eval to renew the POC and update goals.

Hey ya'll.  I am getting my pelvic health mobile practice up and running.  Was wondering what everyone uses, and love, for giving HEP / exercises to patients.  I have been generally just using their phones to video them or myself doing exercise.  But kind of want something a little more "professional" and organized.  Thoughts?  Anyone use AC Health?  TIA

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
Many of us are trying to operate in a coaching or educational capacity without establishing a patient-clinician relationship.  From a legal standpoint, are there things or language you can use to protect yourself and not accidentally cross the line?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am taking a page from Mike Chua's methodology. Here is what ChatGPT said:
...
Operating in a coaching or educational capacity without establishing a patient-clinician relationship is becoming increasingly common, but it does require clear boundaries to avoid legal issues. Here are some strategies and specific language that you can use to protect yourself and ensure you're not crossing the line into providing medical care:

1. Disclaimers
Clearly state that your services are educational or coaching in nature, and not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Use disclaimers prominently on your website, in written materials, and at the beginning of your sessions. Example disclaimer:

"Disclaimer: The information provided during this session is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice or a patient-provider relationship. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your health or exercise routine."
2. Language to Avoid & Alternative Phrasing
Avoid language that implies direct care or treatment. Refrain from using terms like "treatment," "prescription," "therapy," or "diagnosis." Instead, use terms like:

"General guidance," "educational information," "suggestions," "best practices," or "insights."
For example:

Instead of: "I recommend you perform these exercises."
Use: "These exercises are commonly used for people experiencing similar symptoms, but please discuss this with your healthcare provider to determine if they're right for you."
3. Clarify Your Role
Make it clear that you are acting as a coach or educator, not a healthcare provider in this context. Examples:

"I am providing this information as a coach/educator, not as a healthcare provider."
"Our interaction today is intended to provide general information and education, and does not establish a clinical relationship."
4. Encourage Seeking Medical Advice
Always direct individuals to seek personal medical advice from their healthcare provider for specific questions or issues:

"Please consult with your physician or healthcare provider before implementing any changes or if you have specific concerns about your condition."
5. Avoid Providing Individualized Treatment Plans
Avoid crafting specific treatment plans or exercises tailored to an individual’s specific condition without an assessment, as this could be interpreted as practicing physical therapy. Instead, focus on providing generalized information:

Instead of: "Based on your symptoms, you should do these exercises."
Use: "These are some common exercises that people find helpful for this type of issue. Please discuss them with your provider to determine if they are suitable for you."
6. Document Everything
If you are operating online, maintain records of any interactions and ensure that disclaimers are present in emails, websites, or any digital communications. This documentation can be valuable in showing your intent and the nature of the relationship.

7. Terms of Use Agreement
If you have a website or provide online courses, create a Terms of Use Agreement that participants must accept. This should outline:

The nature of the relationship (educational vs. therapeutic).
Clear disclaimers of liability.
Limitations of your services.
8. Consent for Coaching Sessions
If you provide one-on-one coaching, get explicit consent from the individual, acknowledging that:

"This session is for educational purposes only, and no patient-clinician relationship is being established."
Having them sign a consent form helps protect both parties and establishes boundaries.

9. Understand Scope of Practice Laws
Different states or regions have different laws about what is allowed without a license. Make sure to review local regulations regarding your professional capacity, especially as a physical therapist. For example, the use of certain titles (like "Physical Therapist") can imply a clinical relationship, which could create liability issues. Instead, you could use titles such as "Health Coach" or "Wellness Educator" for clarity.

These measures can help ensure you stay within the bounds of providing coaching or educational services without crossing into clinical practice, reducing legal risks while still providing value to your audience.

> **Response 2:** Yea you need to be clear and have a waiver or disclaimer, but the question is “will it stand up in court?”Anyone wanting to sue you will go for your highest license because it means a bigger settlement. I would look into consulting insurance from a local commercial insurance rep to protect you there. PTs absolutely consult, but if you are educating individually on how to help themselves, it’s a blurry line (vs assisting with a company’s injury prevention plan, or teaching a class).

Hire a good lawyer, make it clear you aren’t providing treatment (not a bad idea to have documentation for sessions to show you didn’t provide treatment), but it’s tough. Like imagine a surgeon opening a nutrition business and then a person goes into diabetic shock.  You better believe that lawyer is going after his medical license. If the surgeon documented what happened each session showing he didn’t advise sugar and the patient signed a waiver acknowledging it wasn’t medical advice then at least the surgeon has a chance in court.

We have family friends whose 11 yo son experienced a traumatic brain injury. They’re looking for a good outpatient neuro program. Any recommendations? Or do any of you go into homes with a lot of experience with traumatic brain injuries? He’s going to need speech, PT and OT. ￼They are in the Allen/Fairview/Lucas area.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am assuming if he is ready for outpatient then he already has completed an intense rehab program?  If not, and this is an acute injury and the acute care hospital is discharging him straight home then I would start with an intense inpatient rehab program that would include 3 hours of therapy each day.  Shriners in Northern California has a TBI program but I’m not sure if Shriners in Galveston, TX does too.  They can certainly get accepted to the program in Northern California if it is the closest, just need a physician to send referral and they accept regardless of insurance or ability to pay.  If they have already done inpatient rehab then the social worker and the staff should be able to provide referrals for the immediate area.  Plus most states have programs for kids, here in California it is called California Children’s Services and it provides therapies and equipment for children with disabilities congenital or acquired.

> **Response 2:** Pate Rehab & CNS (Centre for Neuro Skills) are top Neuro centers in DFW. I'm not sure what percentage is pediatric, but I'd definitely start researching those. They both offer Day Neuro Programs.

Dreaming here and looking for advice from those who have done it or hired those who have changed from an inpatient/home care setting (x 5 years) with no outpatient experience aside from clinical in school about 6 years ago. My dream would be to work with the “average person” and do a combination of personal training and injury prevention and physical therapy. I’m active myself (runner/swimmer/yogi). Thinking about dabbling in personal training to develop that higher level exercise prescription, but unsure of what would be my next best move. Thanks in advance - also hope this is ok to be posted! Please delete if not ok. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I graduated in 2017. Worked inpatient rehab for a year and have been in home health for the rest. I just opened my business in December, a mobile outpatient PT business. I love working with post op patients, post hospital patients, Parkinson’s, and stroke patients. So generally lower level patients. But I’ve had a few people who just want to be active again and have an exercise program started up for them. You GOT this!! There is something for everyone out there. I see people dealing with aches and pains who want to reduce pain and then go on a wellness program with someone who knows more about their diagnosis or condition. It’s doable, you CAN DO IT!! There’s so much to learn but this community is the bomb. There’s a niche for everyone. A lot of PT’s here in my town have a space in a gym or CrossFit gym type area and work with weekend warriors. They are amazing at what they do, a combo of PT and training. Think about what you love to do and that’ll help you decide. What would you do for free if you never had to make another dollar in your life? 🤗

> **Response 2:** I transitioned from 5 years of acute care and 3 years in geriatric to go back to more traditional outpatient and sports. 
First of you have to remember that as a PT you’ve probably forgotten more about this stuff than most people will know in their entire lives, so you’re very qualified even if out of practice! Biggest thing was just brushing up on special testing, reviewing some courses on conditions that you might feel a little rusty on. 
Overall it’s mainly the flow of evals and treatments that takes a little time to get back into. But you’ll be fine and your background in acute or inpatient is a huge huge huge bonus when working with folks who have been through it or when seeing more medically complex patients. It’s a strength not a liability!

Clinical question: has anyone treated with a "slimmers neuropathy" before?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have not, nor had I heard of the diagnosis before this post. Did a brief pubmed literature search and it sounds like thiamine deficiency from poor nutrition with excessive weight loss was a big component. Sounds like you'd treat it like any other peroneal nerve dysfunction. Orthotics/braces if foot drop is severe enough. Russian estim maybe. Stretching to avoid contractures if nerve damage is that severe. Gait retraining and foot/ankle strengthening. I didn't read anything about prognosis tho.

I recently took a dry needling class in atlanta and I practice in Florida. Can i start adding DN in my treatments or do i have to be supervised  every time I dry needle until I get certified or take additional courses ?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In FL you have to be certified and then have 25 supervised sessions.

> **Response 2:** Certification first before you can needle as a treatment. Both UE/ LE courses will get the contact hour requirements. THEN it’s 25 treatments under supervision. Then you can submit for the DN tie to your license number. Once you get the confirmation that your license is updated, then you can needle independently.

Hi guys, I need to find a certified lymphedema therapist in or around the Jackson, MS, area for patient referrals. I’m thinking of calling around to speak with local providers that I can locate online. But I’d like to provide one patient ith a name more quickly than some of my networking may provide. I’ve reached out to several other local PT contacts who don’t know anyone personally. The concern is the low level of the care and lack of education she has told me a family member was already provided. I need to find a CLT PT who will value the relationship with the patient and provides patient education. If anyone has advice on this, let me know.

**Community Responses:**

If I am not mistaken J and J stopped making their white athletic tape (or I haven’t been able to find it for a while)

Anyone have experience with TENEX for lateral epicondylitis? Good success? Healing time? I have a patient that is asking me about it. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did prolotherapy and it worked great. Better than surgery and down time. TENEX is supposed to work well.

> **Response 2:** If the diagnosis is accurate and the person has observable tendinosis at the extensor group on the lateral epicondyle it can be helpful.  Rehab is longer if there is hyperemia on US.  If the person has a tear within the capsule of the RC joint then this will only partially alter their pain.

If you’ve done dry needling to the region that is planned for the procedure several times (especially with periosteal pecking) and they haven’t noticed any changes then this procedure has a lower likelihood of changing things since your needles couldn’t affect the pain generator.

**Original Post:**
I've been thinking about branching out recently as I've noticed a need for mobile Parkinson's style programming like RockSteady or LSVT in my area. What would be first steps for this outside of gaining the certification/clearance to use the programming systems? 

Also, if it's the programming/groups that's being provided would it HAVE to be called OT and require an order/be billed as OT? Or is there a way around the referral process to make it more accessible? I live in Illinois and am fairly certain it's a direct access state per the state practice act but I could have misread. Ideally, I imagine running it like a gym model - offering groups and 1:1 at a specific "class rate" or "membership rate."

Thanks for any and all insight!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Honestly I’d look into PWR instead of LSVT- it’s more adaptable and modifiable to patients. I know a lot of personal trainers teach PWR classes…community word of mouth, no formal referrals

> **Response 2:** In order to officially offer PWR, LSVT BIG, or Rock Steady, you would need to take the respective courses to get certified.

To offer PWR as a non-therapist, you could get certified as an instructor. That track is geared toward the various fitness instructor roles, and can of course also be taken by clinicians.

Rock Steady is by default a wellness/exercise based certification. You can get certified as a therapist and could use the ideas in your practice, but you would not be providing the skills of your discipline. It would be a Rock Steady class. 

As far as I know, there are only clinician certifications for LSVT BIG. There is BIG for Life, though, which may be something other fitness instructors qualify to get certified in. I frankly haven't seen many of those classes, and there's a prerequisite for the patient/client to have already gone through and graduated from a full round of LSVT BIG.

...

I am certified in both PWR and LSVT BIG as a clinician. I have a mobile therapy model and rarely use LSVT BIG because it's exhausting to me personally, and because most of my clients would struggle with the intensity due to age, anxiety, orthopedic concerns, etc.

I plan to get certified as a PWR Moves Instructor, which is way more focused on building an exercise class. As a therapist, I highly value both PWR certification tracks. (I might also get a personal training cert.)

Keep in mind that if you do mobile THERAPY visits, most of these folks have Medicare or a Medicare replacement plan with out of network benefits. Unless you only want to work with YOPD or only want to do exercise classes, I strongly recommend you examine the rules for Medicare billing. The Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group can help with that area.

Hello, Need some advice, curently I sublease a space once a week on a thursday. In your experience as a new practice while you are still employed other days, do people prefer Saturday hours or weekday hours are better as a newbie. *I am a Pelvic and Ortho PT

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What are the goals of the screens?  Are you the only provider in a rural area trying to get high level care to athletes, or are you competing for business where the athletes have many good options?

If a service I would look into telehealth PT resources.  If competitive I would do in person to build relationships.

Question: 

If a PT contracts in a wellness /injury center with chiropractors, acupuncturists, masseuses and an exercise physiologist- and a person is sent by MD for multiple services, does the PT have to do a full Eval with their own plan of care to provide treatment or can the PT intervention be part of the plan of care already established by the chiro who initiated the care? Also, in the same scenario, does the PT have to be on site for the EP to implement recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

Hello everyone, 
I would love to get some idea ideas on how to structure commission for an employee  who does dry needling. 
The employee is paid $65 an hour. Dry needling charge is $45 for up to 3 body parts. It takes about 5-10 mins to do DN and usually is done within the hour of the patient treatment. All material cost is covered by the clinic. How much is a fair amount to give the employee as commission per dry needling encounter. 
Any suggestions/ other ideas are welcome 
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dry needling certification is expensive and an asset to the clinic. I think it depends on how many patients are being needled by this employee as supplies are not cheap either. I would run some numbers and see how many patients would be needed to cover the cost of the supplies and maybe offer incentives to the employee based on the patients needled. If that’s too much to track then maybe split the charge.

> **Response 2:** $65 an hour sounds inclusive to me :)

Any vestibular PTs on here with experience with horizontal canal cupulolithiasis?

I would love to pick your brain, treating my friend for free who has had recurrent BPPV over the years. Generally it's been in the posterior canal and we've treated it successfully  in one visit. 

This time around she appears to have it in the cupula of the horizontal canal and I'm having a tough time clearing it. Both sides symptomatic,  one side more intense 2 min duration, the other less intense  but 7-8 min duration. I have never seen this long of a duration of nystagmus and symptoms.  Ageotropic nystagmus on both sides.

Have done Gufoni with both  head up and head down on both sides, spaced days apart.

I'm almost starting to think it might be something else but wanted some input!

Looking for a cash pay provider near Buffalo, NY for a woman in her early 60’s.  She has rib/mid back/diaphragm tightness that has responded ok to her in-network PT provider treatment plan but she got a significant decrease after I did some manual work to her, when she was visiting her daughter who is a client of mine in Massachusetts.  She is looking to either supplement or switch care completely depending on the fit.  Diaphragm release/ manual skills, pain science education and home program building are needed.  She also has Bell’s palsy that she is not currently treating as the steroids are helping so if you are well versed in Bell’s Palsy you may be able to add treatment on for that.  Thank you.

I'm looking into switching from Medbridge to Physitrack for HEP.

I've had a lot of complaints from patients about the Medbridge App.  When using the "coaching" option that runs them through the exercises, the rest breaks and hold times are off and it has been confusing to some.  They have complained that a couple of simple exercises have taken them 45 or more minutes to complete because the "coaching" option is slow (it should take around half that time).

Does anyone have any patient feedback when using Physitrack?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should try AC health! It’s a video HEP format where you can record or have pre-recorded exercises for your client. It’s extremely easy, my patients tell me they like it more than a paper version and I have their HEP done before they even leave my office!

> **Response 2:** I had to use physitrack at my old job, no complaints. A few patients downloaded the app but not a lot. I still honestly preferred HEP2gos program, although there’s no app the exercises were much easier to find and more what I needed. Again, there’s no app to that one but it’s free!

Question…dos anyone else see a trend in so many people being put under hospice, especially in facilities? I’m sure it’s so that they can receive more care with ADLs and equipment, meds, etc and lighten the load of the staff. My issue is that I’m receiving therapy orders but treat them the same as I would any of my patients with setting goals and working toward return to PLOF or maximizing functional mobility and I just got a letter from CMS basically stating my utilization is higher than the national average and I should check for compliance. Am I wrong in trying to treat these patients the same as I would any? Especially if their diagnoses and potential don’t necessarily mean a death sentence per say.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding is that unless you are treating something unrelated to the hospice dx, then you can not bill Med B.  If they require PT, then the hospice company should be providing services under Med A.  Goals under hospice are different as the person is not expected to return to PLOF.

> **Response 2:** I was under the impression that once a patient is in hospice you can’t treat them under Medicare part B, I’m not sure if that’s a law or policy but it’s what my company does that I work for

Does insurance reimburse for myofascial release as a sole treatment? Or MFR with an HEP?
…simply asking, since MFR is not comprehensive treatment. I have not so far provided manual treatment as stand alone treatment or seen it billed alone. He’d like to know his options. He cannot pay out of pocket. 

I am thinking after an evaluation, that the person inquiring may accept additional types of treatments. Otherwise, I would provide myofascial release only if that is his choice and appropriate.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve billed it alone when patient couldn’t tolerate any exercise treatment but have a related issue. A lot of chronic pain patients. and not had an issue.

> **Response 2:** I do a lot of MFR but combine with therex or Ther act doing stretching, PROM as well as educating on posture, sleeping position, pillow choices, chair position.

Quick question for mobile part B therapists who treat Medicare patients. 

Can you see a Medicare patient in a family members home that is not their residence but they are frequently at. 

I treat their sister already who lives 15 minutes from my place and they are wanting me to treat the other sister but she lives 40 minutes away which is outside of my driving range. 

Any clarity would be much appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding would be that the treatment restriction is only state-based (of course, not if the person has been transferred to a facility or something). But a specific address within the appropriate state should be fine, I’d think. You can still use an accurate mobile POS. Other people have thoughts?

> **Response 2:** Needs to be at the patients home

Book and study guide are useful though for areas such as nutrition, programming, technique (videos) and facility design where it’s not so much about how much you know but more about knowing how they want you to answer those questions

I was approached by a company to create a short online training course of 3 hours.  I'm aware of the state requirements in my state of FL and of CE Broker, who they use.  This company is based out of Washington. 
1. Is there a more efficient way to get approval in other states other than apply to each state individually?  To do so is cost prohibitive. 
2. FL does not have reciprocity with any other states. Is there a block of states who DO have reciprocity?

The other option is to just have course attendees self submit, but I'd hate to have them have to pay to do that for such a short course.

Any other options?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Most other states only allow reciprocity if your requirements were not adequately equivalent. You can apply for a new license in other states it’s called an endorsement and it’s a pretty quick process… However, it’s like applying for a new license.

Her doctors told her they want to fuse C2-T4. Complains about numbness and tingling in her feet. Dragging what used to be her strong foot. 

I’ve only done an initial call, no eval. But I’ve seen her in the past when I worked my home health job.

Question for fellow PTs:
I’ve been seeing a dialysis patient on and off for ~2 months with a history of severe cervical and lumbar stenosis, chronic pain, balance deficits, and frequent falls (2–3/week). Initially, therapy focused on gait, balance, stair training, and functional strengthening. He could tolerate 1-hour sessions (likely his most active time of day), and he made good progress.

About a month ago, we paused PT to let the family consult doctors for pain management, BP, and blood sugar issues. During that time, his nephrologist adjusted his dialysis fluid removal to help with BP. Since then, the daughter reports he has had increased weakness, shakiness, and difficulty walking, requiring more caregiver assistance.

On follow-up, he tolerated the session well and felt good afterward, but I see a lack of structure and consistency with his home exercise program, which I think is contributing to ongoing decline.

My question: How do you typically approach prognosis conversations with families in complex cases like this where the patient has medical instability, frequent falls, and fluctuating function? Would you recommend a different approach? If so what kind of approach and how do you community this to the family. The family is really worried about the patient and because of a lack of “goods insurance” the patient is not getting the proper care from his medical team. I’ve communicated my thoughts to the family but wondering how else everyone may approach it!

Thanks and anymoyous because some people will know who the patient is if I post as myself.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This sounds tough. I would probably approach as safety training and how to use the proper equipment to prevent falls. Once CGs and pt does that with less falls, I would potentially even DC if medical situation fluctuates too much. Sometimes I frame it as saving their PT visits for when we can make more progress and for when they’ll really benefit it. If their medical condition prevents progress, it’s also really hard to justify on  a note and can risk insurance denial. I straight up tell the family how insurance works and that we need to show progress and medically necessary treatment and respond to continue. I’ll be firm but kind is saying more than 1x/ week or every other week will not be justifiable with current condition but when their condition improves, we can try increased frequency again..

Expert witness
Sooo, I work at a national outpatient business. I get a call from a law firm asking for an ex employee to sign an affidavit stating that all the PT treatment provided from a car accident was medically necessary. I share the employee is no longer there, they ask for another PT to sign it (and they changed the name on the form as the reviewer, kept that treatment was from original therapist). 

I ask, wouldn’t you have another uninvolved PT do this who isn’t within the company? I was told no, it doesn’t matter, just any PT. The person, paralegal I’m assuming, was trying to down play it like “most people just sign it haha”

So lemme ask: isn’t that a weak argument that the PT who treated would of course say treatment was medically necessary? And same, for a PT at the same company. 

Also- isn’t this thing supposed to be paid? $$$

***update: I looked at the eval and notes , they were poorly done with virtually no objective info, so I declined to sign. My compliance said they were gonna check to see what the balance was. They got back to me and only $110 balance so they were ok without me signing it. The paralegal never responded after I said I wouldn’t sign it 😬. Soo, probably not reaching out to them for private witness statements lol

Hi everyone, I’ve officially booked my first client — woohoo! I marketed in a local FB group offering “pickleball movement assessments” for injury prevention with the intention of this being more of a wellness service. During a quick phone call with the client, he mentioned some chronic knee and hip pain he’s been struggling with that he notices after playing. This makes me wonder if this would change the assessment to more of a true PT evaluation? Does it matter? Thanks in advance, still a bit unclear on how this whole cash-based documentation works!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you offering a different timeframe for a movement assessment vs an evaluation? Usually I’ve seen people do quick 10-20 minute screens then 1 hour evaluations. Definitely think this person would benefit from a full evaluation!

Hi all, so I have a patient with parkinsons's that is complaining of core weakness and low back fatigue particularly with standing for greater than 15 minutes, however reports only very minimal low back pain 2/10 and min difficulty performing daily activities. Patient crushed the BERG, Tinetti, and 5xSTS. Also completed LEFS and modified oswestry but doesnt seem to indicate medical necessity based on his scores.  He is very kyphotic so could use postural corrective exercises and core strengthening, but i have no clue what outcome measure that would be ideal to use in his case. Any recommendations or advice?

I am looking for a PT for patient of mine who will be in Palm Desert CA for the next 4 months. Mostly lumbar radic problems. Would love someone who does lumbar and pelvic, but mostly needs lumbar at this time as the pelvic is pretty much resolved. Mobile or brick and mortar ok. 
She is MC age but has had advantage plan, so we have been doing self pay and submitting after for patient reimbursement.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have her call Gina Malloy when she gets to PD. Gina does Myofascial release and can help with lumbar/ pelvic

Any other hep2go users having issues with the exercises not showing the instructions after you've loaded the exercises? See pic for example. I have the paid version. 
Also, I figured out that if I hit the reset button on each exercise, the text instructions reappear, but then when I went to print it after it successfully was texted to client, it went back to the blank boxes again. 
I've logged out, logged back in more than once. It's doing this for both the general exercise files and my personally created exercises.
Help please??

**🚨 NeuPT HRV Device For Sale – Excellent Condition! 🚨**

I’m transitioning career paths and looking to find a new home for my NeuPT HRV device. This is an incredible tool for anyone in rehab, performance, or wellness who wants to go beyond the basics and bring next-level insights to clients.

**✨ Why HRV is a game-changer for your practice**
* Measures autonomic nervous system balance to show how clients are managing stress + recovery
* Provides objective data on resilience, readiness, and overall wellness
* Helps tailor programs for exercise, sleep, nutrition, and stress management
* Sparks engaging conversations and higher client buy-in—people love seeing real numbers that match how they feel
* Adds a clear differentiator to your services, helping your clinic stand out

**🎧 Bonus context (quick listen):** The NeuFit *Undercurrent* Podcast **Ep. 90** (with Jason Waz of NeuPTtech) talks about how complementary tools like **HRV** give clinicians *immediate feedback* on treatment effectiveness and support better clinical and business outcomes. It’s a great primer on why HRV belongs in modern practices.

**🔎 Want to dig deeper?** Learn more about how HRV fits into clinical workflows here: **NeuPT HRV Overview** — [https://neupttech.com/hrv](https://neupttech.com/hrv)

**💰 Price:** $4,000 (retail typically $6,000+)
**✅ Condition:** Excellent, fully functional, ready to use

This device has been a fantastic addition to my practice, and I’d love for it to keep helping people instead of sitting unused. If you’re looking for a way to elevate your client experience and add a high-value, data-driven tool at a fraction of the cost—this is it.

My own mother has been regularly seeing a Chiropractor for 30+ years…. She now has one that she loves and he actually has her doing exercises, which is great because she otherwise wouldn’t be.  The whole episode isn’t spent trashing Chiro’s, it gets into various causes and treatments for back pain and explains why passive treatments alone are not the solution and surgery rarely is.  This would be a good resource to share with anyone with back pain who hasn’t made the leap to doing Physical Therapy or found the right PT yet.

Here is the link to read year-end apta advocacy and easily send communication to senators.  There was a thread recently where we were all sharing frustrations.  I would invite a quick visit and read and see what you would like to support, if anything.  Happy year-end advocacy.  As someone who doesn't care much for politics or our APTA at the moment, this does still seem like something we could participate in and possibly move the needle forward an inch.  Hugs.

Adding Biofeedback to my Wellness side of the business. Biofeedback is regulated in my state (IA) under my PT License to be able to provide the service. I am using biofeedback cash based but want to ensure my documentation is appropriate. On the wellness side we are using the biofeedback to holistically improve brain/body balance. This shows up in patient complaints of executive functioning, anxiety, depression, stress, hx of head injuries etc. What needs to be included in my goals/diagnosis codes to ensure I am treating within my scope of practice?

Does anyone else get authorization approvals that don’t line up with the patient’s treatment plan at all? We’ll get 8 visits approved over 30 days for a post-op knee that’s clearly going to need twice-a-week care for at least six weeks. By the time we finish the approved visits, the extension request still hasn’t come back. It’s an endless loop of waiting.

Question about superbill/ insurance reimbursement... 

A client just showed me their Care First EOB. They only reimbursed:
 -$76.08 for a $165 low complexity eval visit 1
-$21.69 for a $140 manual therapy visit 2
-$23.24 for a $140 therapeutic exercise visit 3

I thought I was ok keeping it simple and just "charging"/documenting on the superbill one treatment modality for the total cost of the session but now I'm questioning that.

From your experience would they have reimbursed better if I would have written multiple treatment modalities (let's say $70 MT & $70 TE) for the same total charge of $140? Maybe then they would reimburse at least $40 instead of $21 or $23? 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️

TIA

Please comment if you can recommend yourself or a colleague who does mobile visits OR has a nearby brick n mortar in the Cashiers, NC area! Looking for someone that will effectively address lumbar instability to hopefully prevent a spinal fusion. Bonus if there is dry needling offered (not to prevent fusion...my patient just loves dry needling lol).

Insurance- Anthem PPO. Willing to see a PT in clinic too, if needed. Prefers insurance but will consider OON too. 

Also, if any suggestions for dry needling for the same? 

Based on my preliminary assessment- requires significant postpartum/pelvic floor work, myofacial work, hip/lumbar/LE strengthening!
Would like a PT with this expertise to see the patient.

How do pediatric PTs that practice privately (cash-based, mobile or accepting insurance) fund their own health care costs? Do you buy health insurance for yourself and family members through the healthcare.gov exchange?

I am pediatric PT for almost 20 years now. Considering a move to a private practice model and taking sabbatical, working part-time for some time for better work-life balance and to have more energy and time to explore career options going forward.

My biggest concern/future expense for myself is health care coverage. I am located in Illinois currently but thinking about moving to NY or CA in the near future to be closer to family.

In urgent need of a vestibular PT in Cleveland (North Olmsted), OH for a family friend. Mobile PT preferred but outpatient PT is fine too & good ENTs around in that area she can see for further vestibular testing. Any recommendations ?

Are there any OTs in this group based out of Houston, that would be willing to treat post-stroke patients? If so, I may have some potential referrals. 

Thanks!

Hello everyone!  I am searching for a PT in part B home health who is good with shoulder and neck pain management as well as focused on progressive strengthening in the Chesterfield MO area.  My mother in law has been having issues with her left shoulder which is exacerbated by BLE strength deficits.  I have given her exercises but live 600 miles away.  Her part A home health did not address the pain except exercise which only exacerbated the pain.  
Do you know of anyone in the St Louis (Chesterfield) area who could provide this service?  Her physician is very open to making referrals.

Colleagues with the CSCS certification:

Any of ya’ll still have your study materials that you wouldn’t mind parting with? Even better if you have something in pdf form that you can email me. It’s a certification that I’ve been putting off getting, but the Special Forces Group I’m with wants me to get it so looks like it’s something I’ll be adding to my resume soon. Thanks ya’ll!

Can anyone help me fully understand New Jerseys practice act when it comes to offering personal training services as a DPT... 

I have been running my own place for just under a year that offers both group fitness classes and individual appts and I have always marketed my individual appts as physical therapy but I would like to also offer individual personal training ( I have the NASM cert as well) ...my lawyer has created a waiver for both the group classes and the individual personal training that basically says it's fitness ONLY regardless of my licensure as a physical therapist...and then I have a separate one for physical therapy...

Does that do it for covering me or no? Anyone fully understand the practice acts? Specifically NJ!

Is there a myofascial release or similar course you’d recommend? I’m an OT certified in dry needling UE, neck and face and looking for complementing services to offer. I have not yet tested waters for a concierge mobile practice but I love the idea of such. I’d like to market as pain management and relaxation specialist. Thanks!
