**Original Post:**
Has anyone on here officially switched to performing 100% wellness and/or personal training services?

I've heard of  PTs who have  let their license lapse to do this so they weren't so restricted doing virtual sessions and instruction across state lines.

If you're out there I would love to know who you are and connect with you.
I'm not saying I'm going to let my PT license lapse yet but I think of this from time to time. I'm 30 years into my career and I'm thinking about changing it up at some point.

I would love to focus on prevention of a lot of the things I wind up treating in people's later years.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m certainly thinking about it as a side gig, I have a non compete though. Do you guys know if this is ok since it’s not “PT”?

> **Response 2:** I have!  I have founded TSM the Stretch Method that is purely Wellness cash and focuses on prevention! A Stretch Mobility Coach performs the service!  Happy to chat about it!

**Original Post:**
I have an employee who is planning to start her own clinic and take some of our patients with her. I was trying to be chill about it as it is a neuro caseload and our bread and butter is hand therapy. I have, though, put a ton of money and effort into building that caseload. Over the last couple of weeks, she has given her new card to people and has even said to me that she’s getting credentialed with such and such insurance so she can take patient x. It has felt very triggering and stressful so I have decided to let her go now rather than letting her work a few more weeks for me. She is acting like I am being very unreasonable. Am I being unreasonable?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That is not ok of that therapist. Whenever I’m leaving a position, I’ll only tell them where I’m going if they ask and I stay vague without offering any information. If they persist, I’ll take their number and if they reach out, they have a right to stay with someone they’re comfortable with. Soliciting for a direct competitor at your workplace is really not ok

> **Response 2:** While a non compete is hard to enforce, you can’t prevent people from working. Poaching clients is different. That is a non solicitation agreement. 

Here are some options:

Potential legal claims without a non-compete Even if a non-compete agreement is invalid, an employer can pursue legal action against a former employee for "poaching" clients under other legal principles. 

1. Breach of fiduciary duty or duty of loyalty During employment: An employee owes a duty of loyalty to their employer. If an employee tries to steal clients while they are still on the company payroll, they can be sued for a breach of this duty.

"Corporate opportunity" doctrine: Some courts may view soliciting clients for a competing business during employment as taking an opportunity that rightfully belonged to the employer. 

2. Misappropriation of trade secrets 
Confidential information: If an employee uses confidential or proprietary information, such as a client list, pricing strategy, or internal data, to solicit clients, they can be sued for trade secret misappropriation.

Misappropriation laws: The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), adopted by most U.S. states, protects companies from employees using trade secrets for their own benefit. 

3. Tortious interference
Interfering with a contract: An employer can file a claim for tortious interference if a former employee intentionally and improperly disrupts the company's contractual relationships with its clients, causing financial damage.

Interfering with a business relationship: 
This claim is similar to tortious interference with a contract but applies when no formal contract exists. It involves improperly interfering with the company's prospective business relationships.

I was told that If I provide personal training as a physical therapist I’m technically operating under my physical therapy license.  Is that true?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding is. 

You are almost always held to the standard of your highest licensure. This is dependent on state practice act etc…

> **Response 2:** You can provide personal training services but you’d need separate credentials for it (if doing it professionally), and you wouldn’t be able to discuss your physical therapy degree/license/experience.

I honestly haven't researched at all, but PT is no longer considered professional degree under department of health.  Chiropractors are still.  Quick search stated to be professional: Need a doctorate degree and licensure.  I'm not sure why we came off the list.  I know this is referring to loans 
But if we are not seen as professional, will that mean we don't need professional liability insurance?  
My state (MN) doesn't consider us professional when it comes to LLC or PLC.

**Community Responses:**

Anyone have a resource for guidelines for website compliance? Building my website now! I.e. privacy policies, terms and conditions, etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance - 2 different sets of laws in play: Section 1557 of ACA, and ADA, Title III (public accommodation).  

Both areas applicable to therapy practices - both different pathways to compliance.

Are you aware that at any time, a politically appointed (not elected) state board can strip you of your license — your career, your reputation, your livelihood — over a treatment you’ve never received a single complaint about?

They don’t even need to cite a valid regulation. In fact, they don’t have to follow any existing regulation at all. They can invent one on the spot, and weaponize it against you — retroactively — to destroy everything you’ve built. And if you think poor reimbursement is the biggest threat to our profession, just wait until you experience being professionally erased without cause or accountability.

This is what our field has become.

And when it happens to you? Don’t expect help from:
 • The APTA
 • The FSBPT
 • The Governor, AG, or your legislators
 • Any civil rights or whistleblower organization

They’ll all say how terrible your situation is — but none of them will lift a finger. The system protects itself. The courts will side with other government agencies while your due process, constitutional rights, and professional dignity are obliterated.

If this can happen to one of us, it can happen to any of us.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** After an unblemished 20-year career with no prior complaints, my professional life was dismantled by a coordinated campaign of retaliation, regulatory overreach, and political targeting.

It began with a former employee who violated her non-compete agreement, admitted to taking patients, and settled out of court. That same individual, aligned with a direct competitor, threatened to “get even.” Shortly after, multiple complaints were filed—not for any treatment rendered, but for recommending a valid, evidence-based clinical option that was never even performed.

The very day my wife and I took possession of our new facility to expand our business, I was summarily suspended.

What followed was an unprecedented 15+ hour hearing that resembled a kangaroo court more than a fair administrative process:
 • All expert witnesses were excluded.
 • Over 300 letters of support from patients and providers were ignored.
 • The sitting Board president admitted he was unfamiliar with the applicable rules and regulations.
 • The lead investigator testified she hadn’t reviewed the case file or any of the submitted evidence.

Despite this, I was indefinitely suspended—initially for “no less than two years,” now approaching four—based solely on a recommendation, not a treatment, involving a patient who continued under my care for nearly a decade and never filed a complaint.

The charge? A non-existent regulation fabricated on the spot—retroactively applied to conduct from 2015—in blatant violation of the Administrative Process Act and the authority of the Virginia General Assembly. And these phantom rules? Enforced exclusively against me.

But it gets worse.

The Department of Health Professions (DHP), Board of Physical Therapy (BOPT), and Board of Nursing (BON) were complicit in altering medical records—falsely relabeling physical therapy patients as massage therapy clients. The BON, which has no jurisdiction over PT practice, then judged my physical therapy treatment under massage therapy standards. Although even they didn’t find the patient as credible as the BOPT claimed, they issued a formal reprimand—placing a blemish on my massage license for a patient who was never a massage client.

Now, nearly four years later, the Board is attempting to revoke my license permanently.

Meanwhile, the disciplinary double standard is staggering:
 • A female PT who had sexual relations with multiple patients received probation.
 • Another female PT who treated patients under the influence and received a DUI served a one-year suspension.
 • A Board “witness” who disregarded physician orders and patient consent continues to practice without sanction.
 • A male therapist who slept with a 19-year-old patient and practiced without a license was suspended for under a year—with no ongoing restrictions.
 • Another male therapist arrested twice for sexual assault was suspended for three months the first time, one year the second—and is now back in practice, unrestricted.

Yet I remain indefinitely suspended—nearly four years and counting—for recommending a clinically valid, expert-supported treatment option that has never drawn a single patient complaint.

This is not regulation. This is retribution.
This is not oversight. This is targeted persecution.
And unless it is exposed, it will continue to happen to others.

Question (my apologies if this has been asked). I am a sports PT and have my CSCS. I have recently been approached by two people who want me to train them privately. I do not hold a personal training cert specifically. I have heard in a lawsuit they can go after your highest license so I definitely want to protect myself. Is this something I can offer to people under “wellness” making it clear it is not PT? If so, what are some things I should consider setting up ahead of time such as an LLC, liability insurance, consent forms reviewed by a lawyer etc? Want to ensure I’m strategic about this. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You definitely always want to delineate between skilled PT services and non skilled PT services whether you name it wellness or something else. However, in a court of law, and to your state PT board,  you can't be a PT sometimes and not be a PT other times. We are always PTs and we give advice and guidance based off of our expertise as PTs. This is why you can train someone in a wellness AND a rehab program. Your malpractice insurance covers you, it doesn't delineate whether or not you're doing PT stuff bc your are a always a PT.

> **Response 2:** Yup! LLC I would just have your name & wellness (not required, just a double safety net) clear consent / client contract forms they sign “understand this is not PT” , and get liability insurance to cover that highest degree

For anyone with a business that your started before 2024, there are two legal things you need to do by the end of the year:
1. Authenticate Your Domain through your email provider (to comply with a new law and not have your emails go to spam)
1. File for BOI (to confirm you are the owner) - https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/

Note: I apologize, but I do not have time to go into details about these things. These are based on two laws that came out this year for business owners. I am not an expert, but was guided by one of my mentors/friends who owns a business that this is something to do. I shared this to be helpful and I am absolutely not an expert on this nor am I aiming to be. Feel free to look up more details on your own if you are unsure.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just filed my LLC for billing and my attorney said this comes with hefty fines if not done. That's about all I know! 🤷‍♀️

**Original Post:**
Hi Everyone! I am so grateful for this community for keeping the vision alive and the passion in my heart. 

I left my outpatient job earlier this year and when initially meeting with an attorney was told my non-compete most likely wasn’t valid and that if I was providing mobile cash services (that my previous company didn’t offer) I wouldn’t have to worry about my non compete at all. I went ahead and started the bootcamp course, established an LLC and the early steps of beginning my business. Then when I met with him again he had oddly flipped his advice and said after further review he felt it was completely valid and I should just lay low for the 18 month non compete term. I feel SO stuck. I have multiple people reaching out for services and I am terrified to move forward. I have a good relationship with my previous employer and told them my intention’s. It’s a company with 3 owners, two of which I directly worked with and know well. The third was relatively removed and not the friendliest individual. My direct boss even offered to mentor me and share his business journey. BUT something in my gut is telling me to tread carefully because I don’t entirely trust they wouldn’t pursue something if I completely disregarded the non compete. The attorney’s recommendation was to save any profits I make if they do decide to pursue litigation. I have seen a few people cash pay but now I feel as if I shouldn’t. I took a job at a local facility for the time being and I even had a previous patient contact me at my new job asking for services. I feel like it’s such a disservice to my previous clients to just “lay low” for 18 months but I really don’t want to end up in litigation. 

What are other peoples experiences with these types of situations? If I do wait the full 18 months what courses, resources, or readings would you recommend I work on in the mean time to be ready to hit the ground running when the time is right? 

Sorry for the rant! I’m reviewing the boot camp course again today and feel so torn on how to move forward. I miss my patients and I just have so many ideas I can’t wait to explore. 18 months feels like an eternity but I know it’s not the end of the world.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Mobile. Set your office address outside the milage of the non compete. Simple.

> **Response 2:** Most non-competes for our type of work won’t stand up in court. I would continue on

So after almost 30 years in a hospital based clinic, I’m going out on my own! Hybrid office/mobile cash based pelvic/vestibular/ortho. I have 2 requests from you very supportive and experienced people (only 2 for now- so many more to come I’m sure!) 
First, please tell me I can do this. I’m terrified! 😬
And second, through whom do you all have your disability insurance. I see that HPSO has a plan. That’s who my malpractice is through. Your opinions are greatly appreciated. 🙏🙌🏼💪

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
Hello felllow Uncaged!  This post is a follow-up to a post that I made last week about offering paid wellness visits that are NOT considered PT.  I met with my lawyer today, and she told me the following facts that I thought you all might find useful:

1) While it is possible (of course) to charge for this service, whether it is considered "legally physical therapy" or not is up to the law where the patient is present when receiving the service.  For example, If the patient is in Ontario when you performed the service (in person or over phone/video) you would be subject to laws in Ontario.  It is nearly impossible to know how each jurisdiction would behave in the event of a law violation or complaint EVERYWHERE in the world.  

2)  The typical course of action of a governing board such as a state PT board to a practic act violation would be a cease and desist.  If you are sent a cease and desist, you can try to present evidence that you are NOT, in fact, violating the practice act to see if you can convince them to let you continue, or you could simply cease and desist and let it go.  They would only have you cease and desist in THEIR jurisdiction.  For example if the California state board felt that you were performing PT without a license there, they would send you a letter demanding you cease and desist what you are doing IN California.  The chances of legal repercussions or losing your license is low.

3)  You need to advertise what you are doing clearly and specify how it is NOT physical therapy.  The best method to do this is to define Physical therapy as precisely as possible (I.e. performed by a licensed physical therapist, consists of an evaluation, PT diagnoses, customized goals and treatment), and then point out that your wellness program is NOT that (i.e. can be performed by a person who is NOT a licensed physical therapist, does NOT include an evaluation, PT diagnosis, or customized goals and treatment).

4) My lawyer suggested having a contract for the client to sign where they agree to terms, including that they have been informed that this is not PT and will not include anything that would be considered PT or would take the place of medical treatment.  I'm sure that's not all the contract will cover, but she is writing up something formal for me.

5)  Medical liability insurance may not cover a consultation like service.  You need to check with your liability insurance company about whether they would cover it, and if not you need to get general business liability insurance.

6)  Keep records of visits, but those records should not look like a medical record or a Pt evaluative or treatment note in any way.

7)  Treatment or advice cannot be custom unless you are referring to things other providers have already diagnosed them with/advised them of.  Example:  if a neurologist has diagnosed someone with Parkinson's, you can provide them with a general handout from the Parkinson's foundation and go over it with them.  Example 2:  If a doctor had ordered PT for this person recently, but the patient refused to go due to the time commitment as the clinic is far away, you could encourage them to go to PT and help them find a clinic that is nearer to them.

8.  USE YOUR PT KNOWLEDGE to know what is considered NOT PT!  You are literally the expert witness they might call to see if someone who is claiming not to practice PT is practicing PT!  You know the definition because you are the expert.  So don't do anything that is considered PT!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was just dealing with this very issue for a prospective telehealth client - thank you!

> **Response 2:** Re:#5, are “free consults” in a typical PT sense covered by our traditional liability?????

Hello everyone! I've officially started my in-home pediatric private practice this month (yay!!) and have been using Zelle for accepting payments. I now have a new patient who is "challenging" me on this and states they do not want to use Zelle because it is not HIPAA compliant. Can anyone help me with this?

I've deep dived the internet and there are random articles stating it is necessary to have HIPAA compliant payment methods and some other articles saying otherwise. I've finally found a more reliable source, but am still questioning myself on the proper/legal way to go about this.

https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/index.html
* if you look at the last paragraph of this link, I think it's clear that payment methods are exempt...however, I'm unsure if it's simply stating I don't need the signed BAA portion, but still need to be  "HIPAA compliant"?

In addition, the parents wants me to remove my privacy notice section stating I have permission to access their medical record and speak to their PCP; parents want it to be on a case-by-case basis. I don't mind changing the form for them, but would this cause issues in the future??

THANK YOU, this group has been extremely helpful in helping me start my business and feel more confident in it :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like a complicated client/parent. Challenging you etc. Tell them to pay you cash or check if they don't want to zelle you. Or get a credit card reader from PayPal or any other provider.

> **Response 2:** I'd be concerned about them not wanting you to speak with the child's physician. What if there is an issue that needs to be communicated? You would solely be reliant on the parents and you wouldn't know what was actually communicated.

**Original Post:**
There is a chiropractor in town that advertises on his webpage that they offer “physiotherapy” in the office.  Under the description of “physiotherapy”, it lists out only modalities (ESTIM, cryotherapy, moist heat, etc).  Under the chiropractic description they state they offer a blueprint of exercises designed to help with their manipulations”   They do not have a PT on staff.  
Is this legal for them to use the term “physiotherapy” without a PT?   If not, what is the best way to address this?   I’d like to use them as a referral source as they just moved in to the building next to me, so I do not want to ruffle feathers, but I also don’t like how they are downplaying the term physiotherapy to just modalities.   (I’m in Kentucky if it makes any difference.)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely a report to the state board. 
This is a big pet peeve of mine, as they wouldn’t wait a single second to report a PT for advertising “adjustments”. 
I learned after having a similar conversation with a local chiro that they can take an elective “board exam” on “physiotherapy” which is essentially just modalities. But they’re pretty quick to change their tune once they find out they are illegally misrepresenting their business. 
Needs to stay in his lane.

> **Response 2:** They are allowed. As Chiro has a certificate in physiotherapy and rehab so they can use it. So long as they are not advertising “Physial Therapy” formally. Just word games.

I think I saw a recent post about this.  I was wondering who uses a phone line that is different from their personal number.  I am leaning towards a separate business line,  but saving money by just having one is tempting. Thoughts?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Google voice! I wouldn’t use the free version because it is not HIPAA compliant… the paid version allows you to sign a BAA making texting and calling HIPAA compliant.

> **Response 2:** Iplum. You can sign a BAA with them to be HIPPA compliant. I love that it is a different ring so I know it is a business call coming in.

Hello! I am at the point where I need to get a business phone number. I have reviewed posts and am just wanting some real life reviews on the different phone systems. I’d like it to be an app on my cell phone with a local number. HIPPA compliance is a plus if necessary. I will be opening a cash based practice here soon! 

Spruce: $24/month. Seems to have a decent amount of stuff. (Is this an app on your phone?) 

Lead connector through GHL- I saw this posted but am not sure what it is! 

Iplum: $8.99/month. With HIPPA compliance $5.99 if paid annually. Includes: Unlimited calling, texting + Security & backup for HIPAA compliance + Unlimited Secure Texting + Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
‍
Ring central: $20/month. Doesn’t seem to have as many functions. 

Grasshopper: cheapest plan $14/month. $19 one-time +$1.50/month for local number. 

Ring Rx: starts at $15/month -no texting or voicemail transcription on cheapest plan. $19/month includes these two. (Is RingRx an app through my personal phone with a second number?) 

Google voice- I see pricing at $10/20/30 through Google workspace. Looks like it is also free for *personal* use. 

Vonage: can’t find much. Looks like the lowest is $13.99/month 

Thoughts? Any others I should look at? 

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Lad connector with GHL

> **Response 2:** I’m on Google Voice right now and while I’ve been happy with it, I switched my domain and now cannot for the life of me figure out how to port it out (I know there’s articles saying how to do that but they’re all not working for me 😩) so I can associate with my new domain. So I might need to switch numbers which is a pain in the ass. So if I had to go back in time, I’d tell myself to make sure whatever I signed up for can be ported to another service if needed!

You can definitely ask several people about this including your insurance agent, your CPA, or your small business attorney. You will have to calculate the risk on your part to determine the benefit of insuring both and how much patient care you're actually doing.

> **Response 2:** From HPSO, yep, that’s pretty accurate.

Has anyone checked on liability insurance lately? Quoting professional and general for self employed LLC, mobile services. Quotes seem quite different:
CM&F $467/yr
MyPTinsurance $297/yr

Thoughts on either? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

My liability insurance is going up almost $300 this year. I currently have proliability. I just priced out CM&F and it was even higher. Just wanted to check in and see if folks had other options that were affordable. 

Thanks!

If you been working for an OPPT employer and they give you a non-compete contract after working for 1-2 years, can the employer fire you  for not signing the contract if you don't agree on the terms?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** they can absolutely fire u in my state.  Non competes can also be enforced in court.  they are legally binding contracts.  the employer may choose not to enforce it.  the non compete may be written poorly and therefore difficult to enforce.  but if the non compete is sound, and it is clearly violated, it can be legally enforced.

> **Response 2:** They’re not enforceable so don’t worry about it.

If it’s just a landing page generate leads via phone calls, etc.. I wouldn’t worry about all the intricacies as most of this stuff only applies if you’re gathering PHI. 

The rest of the bridges can be crossed if and when an individual become a customer/patient.

Hey, me again lol. Is it necessary to have an LLC, or can I just operate under my license and malpractice insurance? What is the benefit of having an LLC? I am going to work super minimal hours at first, like <10, only cash, I'm the only PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Separation of church and state.   You treat a patient as yourself. They sue you they can come after all of your assets etc.    if you’re a business. Your personal life is kept away from the business. 
It takes 1 hour and maybe a $200 to set up a basic LLC.

> **Response 2:** The LLC protects your personal assets. Without the LLC if there is litigation, your assets could be taken as opposed to the businesses assets. 100% would go with an LLC. Also look for state run financial institutes that certify an LLC- don’t go through legal zoom 😉

Hey guys! Quick question. Is emailing my previous patients from my old corporate job about my new cash paying PT business unethical or a hippa violation? I have about 8 to 10 patients that I happen to have their email addresses from some internal reviews they posted within the company. They posted about me and I wasn’t sure how to proceed because I had a good relationship with them and I would like to let them know where I am now, but I also don’t want to violate anything by sending them an email. Please advise 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would not. It could be construed as a HIPAA violation as to how you got their personal information outside of work

> **Response 2:** It could be viewed as “unethical” from a business perspective and your former employer could take legal action for “poaching” and soliciting their patients  even if you directly were treating them  Technically and legally it is their patients - not yours. This does not include if you also signed any NDA ,  Non-compete is the least of your worries and does not really apply here depending on your state laws. 

It does violate certain HIPAA practice standards since you should not even have their email addresses those should have been discarded upon leaving your former employer - much less attempt to contact them.

There is “freedom of choice” so if the patients do not want to continue with their current provider and decide to seek you out on their own without being influenced from outside sources, then there is nothing your employer can do and your golden.

Her former coworkers got served in person. She doesn’t know what to expect or what to do. Does anyone have experience with this or advice? I told her to consult with her liability insurance but she asked me to check with other therapists. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was named in a lawsuit while working at a SNF.  A patient who spoke sign language sued over not having enough time per day with an interpreter present.  I never actually understood why I was named in it.  We were represented by the company’s attorneys.  I did have to do a deposition which was a terrible experience but the case ended up being dropped.

One more here, I started an llc that I plan to practice under, but I will be the only employee/practitioner, do I need to have liability insurance for myself or for the business? I'm just curious because this is more of a side hustle to start with and it's a fair cost difference.

Topic: NPI 1/NPI 2 
 
Hey all! I have a weird situation and I’m not sure if I need actual advice or just need to talk this out and have someone else confirm what I think I know. 

I have my LLC set and plan to get my cash practice up and running in the next few months. I’d like my patients to be able to submit super bills. Need to figure out NPI. 

When I started my first job out of school, I was practicing under some type of group NPI through a large health system. I set up an NPI1 about 7 years ago when I moved out of state, changed jobs, and started working for a place that billed as a private practice. I left that job after 1 year and since then have gone back to working with the original large health system PRN. Never updated any info for my NPI. 

Option 1: Set up an NPI2, do not enroll with Medicare. Update address info on NPI1. Do I need to do anything with NPI1, like unenroll with Medicare? What about other insurance companies that I may have been affiliated with during my 1-yr private practice stint? No idea how to find out that info if needed. 

Option 2: Update my NPI1. From what I’m reading, if you’re an LLC and you’re not incorporated, you can use your NPI1. Still not sure what I have to do with Medicare or previously contracted insurance companies. 

Will any of these changes affect my ability to work PRN for the large healthcare system? As I mentioned, I believe I function under a group NPI (maybe their NPI2?) as I didn’t have my own for the first 3 years of my career. 

Thanks for any insight, shared experiences, or advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** U don't have contracts under your npi if u want medicare u need a new medicare number.  Mostly insurances contract with type 2 group npi.  Ur type 1 npi number should still be good it follows u for life but u have to update on caqh find out ur password and reattest

> **Response 2:** Your NPI is associated with the other clinics you work for but under they group NPI. Anything you do under your business will not be associated with any insurance contracts.

Hi all! New here.
Me and my husband are planning to start a mobile PT business. Our specialty is Neuro PT. 
We are looking for it to be a side hustle vs full time as of now. I plan to be cash based and not accept insurance as of now. (Is that possible??) A few questions for you, I would really appreciate your input.
1. Besides the legal part of business (PLLC, NPI, etc) what should we look into when it comes to HIPAA rules and other  regulations that I need to be aware of when I start my business?
2. Best websites to create a website? Lol 
3. For people offering treatment/session bundles, how does that work if Say in my state, the direct access expires after 30 days?
Thanks in advance!!!

**Community Responses:**

HPSO went up over $50 in one year so I am cancelling it.

Hi all! Just starting my mobile, cash-based practice and insurance is making my head spin.

I'm looking at CM&F--do I need personal + general liability and then add my business as additionally insured? I'm the only PT, have an LLC, and plan on working part-time hours.

Thanks in advance for your advice!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same as K Joy Lind other than the reputation part.

I switched from CM&F to Berxi for the Medicare audit insurance since I am MC and private pay only.

Gen liability does not cover in patients home though so will need something separate for that.

> **Response 2:** Yes. I have Berxi and I also added Medicare / Medicaid audit ins as well as reputation ins for about $100 extra / year

Hello,

I plan to start a wellness consulting LLC. I contacted HPSO for liability insurance and they said that I should have professional liability insurance to protect my license even if I am not doing official PT and then do a wellness add on. However, they will only cover what I do in the state I am licensed in. I will not be covered if I see clients virtually out of state. And they will not cover supplements. If you are doing a wellness company, will you please shed some light on this? Specifically what type of insurance do you have? Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I called CM&F. They said I'd have to apply for my highest level occupation (so PT) then do an add-on of "wellness counselor." Since I will be the only employee of the LLC, they said to put the policy under my personal name, then add the LLC as additional insured. The policy would "follow me around" wherever I worked and also would cover virtual visits (even if client is out of state). And recommendation/selling of supplements would be covered under the wellness counselor.  --Update, I called them again to ask some specific questions and this different person said that I'd need some type of certification or licensure as a wellness counselor....she said to check how that is defined in the state I am in and check with the Board of Health??

I have concerns regarding HIPPA compliance and having a recording device in the treatment space. Can anyone provide me with resources to figure this out. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you contracted with insurance? If not, HIPAA probably doesn’t apply to you. Most cash providers do not fall under HIPAA regulations. Patient privacy should always be considered, but if the camera is just video and not audio, maybe some sort of partition around your treatment table is enough.

> **Response 2:** Interesting conversation about HIPAA.  I always thought we all need to remain compliant regardless if we contract with insurance or not.

I just got quotes from HPSO and CM&F for professional and general liability. HPSO is over $300 more. I currently have an individual policy with HPSO but it has taken me forever to speak with an actual person. CM&F I usually am speaking to someone within minutes. Before I purchase, is there anything else I would need liability wise? I discussed this with my insurance agent and discussed getting property liability but I’m renting a room and my inventory shouldn’t exceed $1,000 to start! 

Curious who you all went with and why. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m planning to switch to CMF from HPSO. HPSO has been a bear to deal with, I haven’t been able to speak to anyone about added coverage, literally no one will answer the phone or return calls. And it’s more expensive than cmf.

Wondering if anyone has ever continuously used ChatGPT to treat a patient? I have a PI patient whose attorney is refusing to seek translator services because “technology is enough.”
This patient had a consult with an ortho that refers to me and he said it was a disaster with communication because nothing was translating over correctly (Korean to English and vice versa). He actually told the attorney he cannot see this patient unless an actual interpreter is present and has not heard back.
Wondering if I should do the same or if anyone has had success utilizing it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is a title VI issue. 

You are actually required by law to provide a qualified translator for this patient. Google translate it chat GPT or even a family member of the patient would not meet the requirement. In the event a translator is not provided, the patient could sue for discrimination. In the event of a poor outcome or injury, the patient could sue claiming negligence... which makes sense really. You can't treat without an eval and you can't really evaluate properly f you can't communicate.

The big sticker here is who pays for the translator. I've had to eat the cost when the Medicare is the payer since they won't reimburse for it.

You can Google and see some legal precedent. Off the top of my mind I can recall a case where an OBGYN was sued for discrimination for not providing an interpreter and another where an ER doctor was sued because a family member of the patient mistranslated something which led to delayed treatment and poor outcome.

Plus it autofills in your EMR based on the transcript so you can truly focus on just treating. 

Like someone said above though, as a medical provider, I believe you have to offer interpreter services.

Good Morning 
I think I know the answer but had a conversation with one of the PTA who used to work at another O/P PT clinics in the past. I was thinking to hire her and asked if she had an NPI. And she said no and O looked up on NPI registry and she doesn’t have an NPI. Please help me with this. If I have a PTA do they need an NPI? Do they need to get credentialed with insurances and Medicare? Please help me understand this..

TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PTA here of 28 years and never had an NPI.

> **Response 2:** The PT has an NPI all the forms have the eval'ing PT and their NPI, no PTA listed. When insurances call for peer to peer reviews when they deny more visits and only may give a few more after two extensions of a few visits of the 60 they are told they have they don't want to talk to the treating PTA, only the PT that hasn't been working with them. That sums it up.

Had an audit with Medicare for one claim back in February. I sent everything in per their checklist. And I just got something in the mail saying I need to get on a call with them to discuss the case? It’s a “D&E (Discussion and Education session)”

I’m not sure what this is? The document says the claim was partially approved. So I’m not sure what more I can even send them? I sent them everything. What all would be discussed during this zoom call? Has anyone had any experience with this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Mine, I passed with excellent documentation.  I was just instructed that I had 1 year to fix my manual therapy 97140 use to reduced units or I would be audited again. I specialize in manual therapy.
If you are an outlier on the CBR, they will eventually audit you.
So, it could be something as simple as that or education on documentation

> **Response 2:** I got the same letter and called to clarify re: what needs to be discussed after providing them everything I have with what little time I have left verifying, working with patients, documenting and responding to their request. They said it’s an option if you want to do a discussion. It’s not something  you have to do.

Hi group! I currently use trainerize for HEP but I’m having low compliance rate. Debating if I should try coachrx (or another platform) or if I just need to work on getting people to be more compliant with their HEPs * edited to add to some niche background. I am a cash based practice with mostly women that want to go back into a fitness plan. So by the end they would transition to a gym type membership.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What do you think is contributing to the low compliance rate? I'm looking at a bunch of apps now myself and am considering Quick Coach and Physitrack.

I personally think that stressing to patients on the very first visit the importance of the HEP and how it helps them progress faster and make better gains leads to better compliance than the app itself. 

I imagine a message to them as a reminder is helpful but I think if they're going to be non-compliant versus compliant that's not a deal breaker necessarily.

I'd also ask your patients what their main barriers are. Maybe there are too many exercises? Or maybe they could give you some additional feedback that would be helpful.

Business license?
NPI 2?
Private liability insurance?

I’m starting from scratch. TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is basically all I do. 
LLC, EIN, liability insurance, bank account, supplies. 

No need to overcomplicate it. I do consent form, then document what I needled and any adverse reactions. That’s it.

> **Response 2:** State paperwork for LLC
Federal paperwork for EIN (the tax id number thing) 
Personally I got npi 2 but I also take Medicare. Don't think you need it for cash.
Malpractice for mobile (check to make sure DN is covered)
For documentation, I used Google just bc I don't have a TON of patients and it's cheap. But if I had a higher volume, I would definitely get emr. 
You may also want to accept credit card and HSA which would require more out of pocket expenses 

Where are you located? I'm in NJ and my rate is $175 an hour flat, regardless or eval or follow up

Little confused on Liability insurance: I just called CMF and she quoted me approximately $450-500 for the year for 1 employee working full time, $200-300  for part time ( I can't remember the exact amount she quoted but it was in that ball park range for the year). The agent also said it covered everything that " a PT could do via their practice act for the State I was practicing in," and that it would cover me and the business at this time and any secretarial or other admins that currently are apart of or will be apart of the company. But I'd have to change to a group plan once I add more clinicians. Okay, that makes sense to me. 

My question is, after reading some posts- what am I missing- as I see some indicating a general plan and a professional insurance? Would I need an additional plan for malpractice insurance? I was ways under the impression CMF was malpractice insurance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This stuff is clear as mud because they don't just call it malpractice insurance, which I wish they would. I have CM&F, and my understanding is that professional liability insurance = malpractice. I treat you and you are personally harmed as a result of the treatment. Business liability = related to the business itself. So if you go into a home and break a lamp while providing your business service, that would be business liability -not personal injury as a result of physical therapy treatment, but a damage that occurred while doing business. Or if you have a brick and mortar and someone tripped on the way in and breaks their arm- again a damage that occurred while doing business, not related to the provision of therapy services specifically. I would get both.

> **Response 2:** I have a plan with them. I can check my paperwork but I believe it is malpractice and when signing up you can add general liability, which I did. My landlord also requires that piece. But still was half the price of other companies.

Hi friends! Need guidance, I am physical therapist in Indiana, and reside in Louisville. My question is if I rent a house in Indiana and at the same time continuing staying in Louisville, will that be legal to apply for PT compact license for Kentucky state? I talked to Kentucky board for the PT compact license, they replied u need to have Indiana ID to apply for that. And then I am thinking this way renting a house and getting Indiana DL and then PT compact license for KY. Will that work? Or is there anything wrong doing this way? Please guide.
TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve lived in KY (Lou) and worked in IN (Clarksville). I only had my Indiana license for most of that time, but later did have licenses in both KY and IN (compact wasn’t yet an option). I now live in Indiana and have compact privileges in KY. Super easy process both ways honestly. To have compact privileges, you have to hold a full license in your home state of residence - so for example, I couldn’t have lived in KY, had my regular license in IN, and then applied for KY compact privileges. Because I live in IN and hold my regular license in IN, I’m free to apply for compact privileges in any participating state. Does that make sense? I think I’m confused as to why you would rent a house in Indiana if you’re staying in Lou?

Hi all! I am in the early stages of starting my mobile PT business. I know this topic has been discussed on here before, but after looking through old posts, I am still needing some clarity. Is there anyone in Idaho or Washington state who knows if PLLC is required over LLC? I know it varies state to state. I have searched Secretary of State website, called them directly, and have looked over Idaho business statues, but still I am not seeing it spelled out. Wondering if anyone here knows. If it is not required, is there benefit to going with PLLC rather than LLC? I don’t plan to have employees, so I don’t know if the protections a PLLC offers is worth the potential extra time or steps it takes for application?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No benefit to PLLC unless multi members- you aren't liable for another members mistakes/malpractice, whereas an LLC you can be. There's no other benefit, PLLC just requires all owners maintain a state licensure. Not sure on your state req.

> **Response 2:** I am in WA state and hired a lawyer to help me set everything up. She originally set me up as an LLC but realized (after all the paperwork was done) that she made a mistake and I needed to be a PLLC. Luckily, she was a fantastic person and didn't charge me extra for the extra paperwork. All this to say, I hired a lawyer and she said PLLC. What she explained to me was that I have a Professional license and therefore it had to be PLLC.

Liability insurance question

I’m researching liability insurance and trying to get an idea of where to get it and what kind to get. I know I need malpractice/professional liability, but I’m trying to determine if I need general or not. I am starting as a mobile business with no physical location. Every time I select general coverage they want to know how many physical locations there are. I don’t have one. I will only use my home for paperwork and accounting. Do I need general? I feel like based on the description of it, I do need it. But based on the physical location requirement, I don’t. Help?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Lockton  and they provided a general liability policy as part of the offering for my professional liability policy. So I got both for 1 price. That was when I was 100% mobile. Now I have an office and purchased a different general policy. If you break something or run your car into your patients property, you need general liability to cover that.

> **Response 2:** I have general and professional but I have therapists working for me. General covers everything that doesn’t fall under malpractice. Most mobile clinics do have a physical location… your home. If you happen to see a patient at your house you will probably need general. It would also cover cyber breaches I believe.

Any insight on getting re-licensed as a PT if you let it expire? I assume it might depend a bit on state, I’m in CO. Is it better to just keep up licensure and all that entails (i.e. continuing education) when you’re not working if you plan to re-enter years later? I’m just thinking about years down the road and want to have a plan…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Always keep your license. Retesting will be a nightmare and the cost to maintain is minimal.

The test and the prep courses are worth at least 5-10 years of maintaining your license and not using it.

> **Response 2:** I would definitely keep your license up.  Minimal effort and cost to do so and can you even imagine sitting through boards again if you change your mind down the road. 😬

Question for the LLC’s- my best friend is a small business owner with an LLC, (though not a therapist) and she sent this to me as an FYI. Is anyone familiar with this? It seems incredibly scammy to me but just figured I would cover all of my bases because this is the first I am hearing of this. It does not specify whether it is state specific but does have an “ official” web page.

I have Posted  below in comments. 

“ if you have an LLC you need to register  it with the financial crimes enforcement network before the end of the year.”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No, this is actually legit.  It’s a federal thing.  If you started a business before Jan 1st this year, you have until Dec 31st to claim ownership (its real easy to fill out the info online).  If your business formed after Jan 1st,  2024 you were supposed to fill out the ownership claim within a certain timeframe (I think something like 30-60 days)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** CONGRATS!! LETS GOOOO!! 💪🦁

Sue Doyle brought up the excellent points 👌👌

> **Response 2:** yes. You need to make sure this is the correct business structure in your state to offer both. Then your business NPI needs to be updated to note both. Then you can go ahead and apply for Medicare credentialing.  Make sure you have a compliance plan and policies and procedures in place.

For those of you that have hired additional therapists, did you provide them with liability insurance or do they just get their own? I was thinking it would be good to add an employee to my liability insurance if able but wasn't sure how that worked.

Anything else you added that would be helpful for me to know?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What Sue Doyle said 👍

> **Response 2:** You will need to notify your business liability (both professional and general liability) company about adding employees. There will be an extra cost. You use the word employees so I am assuming these are W2 employees as all others are contractors.

Rookie here.

I'm looking to become an independent PT in Illinois, and after doing my research, I need to start a PLLC instead of just an LLC. Could some of you point me in the right direction on how to get the PLLC process started? I've been digging, but the more I do, the more confused I become...Plus, what are your thoughts on being your own Registered Agent versus hiring a third-party company to be your RA? Any links and/or comments with further information is incredibly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can’t do the paperwork online for a pllc in Illinois… as hard as I tried 😂 you have to mail it in, with a certified check or cash. Took about 4 weeks I believe to process. I elected to use a friend who’s a lawyer as my
Registered agent. But I know others locally who used themselves or their accountant. It will make them the point of contact for renewals and probably other things that I forget now.

> **Response 2:** I’m in NY so I’m not sure if this is how it works in Illinois but in order to form a PLLC you have to have your state physical therapy license first verified (in NY you go through the dept of Ed and get a certificate approving it) then you file the articles of incorporation with Secretary of State. I do believe you are more protected with a PLLC over an LLC so I think it’s worth it IMO.

Can I give a superbill without having a business NPI?

**Community Responses:**

I would definitely recommend a buisness NPI. I personally have head of stories where people do not get reimbursed properly.

> **Response 2:** Depends on the insurance. Humana and Cigna have both asked for a group NPI number separate from mine. I’m a sole proprietor and had to get a group NPI

Non-PT specific HIPAA question:

** UPDATE:  Both providers easily relented after I sent an explanation article about the Cures Act and explained that I can also just get the results myself from the lab / that it is now routine to get immediate results from traditional healthcare via patient portals.  Education for the win! I also have prior personal relationships with both people so it wasn’t a hard fight. **

Through HIPAA, it is my right to have access to my medical records including lab reports, etc upon request.  For example, when I get testing via my PCP, I get the results immediately when they are available.  Labcorp notifies me and I can access independent of talking to the order physician.  

I've had 2 functional medicine providers refuse to share test results with me until I meet with them.  One is a chiropractor and the other is nutritionist.  

As a cash-PT myself, I've heard that HIPPA doesn't necessarily apply if i'm not involved with insurance.  Yet, I follow HIPPA as that is the standard and what patients expect.  Also because i'm not certain when and when it doesn't apply so it's safer to just follow the rules.

SO...  Should I expect the same access to my medical records and test results from the Functional medicine providers?  Or does HIPAA not apply to them since insurance is not involved?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I personally would expect to be able to see the results. You are paying for them in some form, even if included in the “eval” price.  That sounds a little concerning.

> **Response 2:** Yeah chiros and functional med are notorious for this. I've contacted the lab on my own before and even requested them through my clinic or a friend's to circumvent. It's ridiculous.

Hi,
Have followed this group for a while but first time posting. I’m a licensed PT In Pennsylvania. I “retired “ less than 2 years ago but have kept my license active. I have 31+ years experience in multiple settings. My husband and I are beginning to travel around this beautiful country of ours in our RV beginning in November.
We will be In Arizona November 2023 through April 2024 to start.
Due to licensing issues with Pa not being a compact state and the $$$ to get clearance to work in states other than Pennsylvania via travel agencies seems a bit excessive.

What are other options?????

Ty in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do something that doesn’t require a license and it’s blue skies from there 

You mentioned travel agencies… if you’re referring to working as a traveler in Arizona - those agencies will cover the cost of your travel and licensing requirements.

> **Response 2:** I would do wellness type treatment. No state restrictions with that.

If I have a mobile private practice (doing OT in client’s home), is liability insurance through HPSO (coverage 1 mil/claim, 3mil/aggregate) $120/yr sufficient or do I need more coverage?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I also made sure my policy included general and professional liability. General covers other things like someone falling in your parking lot (which I realize is different with a mobile practice but it’s that kind of thing vs something happening as a result of their treatment).

> **Response 2:** I worked for a big company and was named in a lawsuit from a former patient along with all other providers involved in her care. 
What I learned was that they go after the biggest insurance policy. Since I was covered by the company policy and didn’t have a separate one for myself, they removed my name and didn’t come after personal assets. So my takeaway is carry a reasonable amount like the $1m/$3m and if you have more then they’ll just go after more in a lawsuit.

Do you provide company computer or do you allow therapists to use their computers?
Feedback have been that they like using their personal computer better. If that’s the case what do we need to install to be HIPAA compliance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depending on the specific operations I’d be careful letting them use their own because you don’t know what security settings they may have or malware etc. plus it’d be easier for them to steal info if the relationship goes south.

> **Response 2:** I realized this is a NBCOT question. 

It’s a huge ethical dilemma to use a personal device for EMR. It puts the company more at risk for HIPAA violation and if audited the entire device can be searched not just the EMR which means the therapist could get in trouble for other things they look at or participate in their personal life.

TEXAS practitioners***

I am desperate for some clarity.

I am a PLLC only providing OT services at this time. I am wanting to add PT and ST services so this requires me to amend my PLLC to LLC per entity rules.

I had a meeting with a buisness lawyer today to assist with amending my PLLC to LLC correctly. He said that per CPOM rules for TX this will be out of compliance with healthcare regulations in our state of Tx. I am assuming that most LLCs provide multiple discipline services, so how are all these practices compliant? Do therapy practice apply to CPOM rules?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are NOT a licensed home health agency in Texas (which cost thousands of $$ & a lot of time to become); then you are credentialing everything under you and only you. You are a third party payment if you are not & have to be set up as TPR which is what he is saying but under 3rd party, you will need to see if you can operate w/ other disciplines (all of this will open doors of being audited by the srate, & you will get audited). It is how you are set up. I would take a home health agency set up course to help understand.

> **Response 2:** I believe that If you are going to provide professional services of any sort it has to be under a PLLC an LLC wouldn’t suffice for professional services. 

Why would you want to convert it to an LLC?

I have a great CPA, but would also like to talk to any clinic owners that have switched from an LLC to an Scorp. Business is rolling hot and she says we definitely need to switch over. Does anybody file with their SCorp under their LLC for liability reasons? I'd appreciate any input the group has. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** An S-Corp, as my CPA explained to me, is just a tax designation. I’m still and LLC but file as an S-Corp.
If you fully incorporate into a C-Corp, there’s different paperwork to file with the state annually.

Not a difficult process at all.

> **Response 2:** I do. I made the switch in January. I haven’t had a chance to see all of the impacts yet as it’s my first year but feel free to ask any questions. Hopefully someone else will chime in as well

Quick question:

I know this may depend on state (I am in Colorado), but does a license need to be clearly hung up on a clinic wall? And what about diploma? 

I once held a position that required both and another that did not. 

I’ve looked through the practice act and it does not have verbiage that describe any rules like that. Though I may have missed something. 

Thanks all, it’s the small things that freak me out that could get us in trouble.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look under rulings for the department of health or something similar as that is likely where those regulations lie for your state

> **Response 2:** Texas,  the license needs to be displayed at your primary location, others keep a copy in a file but not displayed. Not sure about the diplomas, but I have mine on the wall. 🤷‍♀️

A quick call to your state board would clear this up.

I am needing a phone system that is cell-phone based, connects several therapists, allows us to answer from our personal phones, allows us to forward calls to whomever is scheduled to answer or to a VA, and is HIPAA compliant. 

Anything is helpful to my limited understanding. I'm excited to learn more as I read your replies! Thank you!

What are people using to collect new patient inquiry info from their website that is HIPPA compliant?  To be able to send out intake documents through PTEverywhere we need to collect Name, DOB and Email.  PTE has a self registration link, but it is not customizable and does not include other information we would like to collect like the reason they are seeking PT, who referred them etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My lawyer says if the patient fills in their info and sends it to you that it can never be a HIPAA violation.  It was their info and they could provide it to whomever however they please.  Once you have it, you have to store it in a HIPAA compliant way, and cannot send it through non-HIPAA compliant means to anyone but a patient/patient-approved family member or appropriate healthcare provider.

> **Response 2:** We are a mobile clinic, so self scheduling is not an option for us.

For those mobile providers wondering if general liability is worth it? Upon reviewing all my 2022 docs I realized I have 2-$1,000,000 policies … BOTH are costing me $67/both TOGETHER!!

Who are you using for liability insurance?  Bonus points if you comment the company and if you are a mobile or clinic practice, if you dry needle, and if you have had and good/bad experiences with a particular carrier.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting. I just started my PLLC this summer and have CM&F, have my PT under it but not doing that yet. I have my Reiki and CPR instructor and paying for part time general and professional liability for $485 and that was the cheapest I could find. Had a lot of trouble finding all three practices covered under one company. CPR alone was $499 because they wouldn’t do part time for that only PT. Another company would cover my CPR at part time but I would have to get a separate policy for more money for my PT. It was a nightmare. Getting my dry needling certification in January.

> **Response 2:** New to CM&F this year. Mobile and dry needling. Switched from HPSO because they quoted me $1200 for the year and CM&F was just over $400.

I am grateful to this group for sharing your experiences on building and launching your PT practices. The information has provided excellent guidance in my own process.  

At this stage I am looking for recommendations for: a business banking account and professional liability insurance both for myself and for the business.

I appreciate any and all suggestions.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use CM&F for liability. 

And a local credit union for banking. They're so good, that I opened a personal banking account and closed my old account with a big name bank. 😂

> **Response 2:** Banking I use novo (if you want a code for a reward let me know) but local credit unions are great too

Is there a reference sheet or resource somewhere for getting a cash based practice up and running? I want to get my practice set up within a month or even within next few weeks, if possible. Or am I expecting too much of myself in that timeline? Anyone who has resources or advice for me, please drop them below! If you have something to share via DM, I will reach out to you. Thanks in advance! 

Note: I’ll be leasing an already built out space, so no work to do there. I already have liability insurance (just need to add this facility onto it), a lawyer for consult, and an accountant. Demo set up with Jane App. Will register my LLC with the state and check with the county and city on what is needed.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Establish NPI? Fill out CAQH. Even for cash based if patients try to be reimbursed you'll need to do that. Medicare?

Hi all! Looking for some feedback here. I am currently uncaged and employed by a company that employs a number of uncaged PTs at a few different locations. The location I am in is a boutique gym that is looking to go more of the wellness route in addition to personal training thus are interested in hiring me on as a PT as I have thrived there. If I left the company I’m with and decide to join the gym as a PT do I need to form my own LLC or would I be okay with being an employee of this gym? I would obviously need to obtain liability insurance, my own EMR etc, but what else am I missing that I would need to think about? There is not an non compete I need to worry about at all. Appreciate any feedback!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why.not establish your own LLC and reap the rewards of the work that you’re going to have to put into growing the clientele?

> **Response 2:** You’re employed by a company offering PT services inside a gym, and the gym wants to hire you directly? 
I’d be surprised if your employment contract didn’t explicitly prohibit this situation.

**Community Responses:**

The compact lets you apply for the license in an expedited manner,  but you still have to obtain the license.

I am looking to start my own cash based business out of a local gym. I have professional liability insurance through HPSO and am getting my LLC setup. Do I also need business insurance? And is malpractice insurance the same as the liability insurance or do I need that as well? I’m in PA. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Malpractice is “Professional Liability” insurance and it’s different from a general liability policy. General liability would cover people getting hurt on property. Commercial peoperty insurance covers you for theft, fire, flood, etc. business owners insurance (BOP) combines general liability, property and income insurance. Umbrella is an added layer that can cover some additional things.

You should have some sort of liability insurance in addition to your malpractice insurance. Most commercial landlords will require some sort of liability and property insurance. I would recommend getting an umbrella policy added on as well.

I work for a large hospital system, and am starting my own cash based mobile practice. When I log in to the CMS website to view my NPI, it shows my name under employer, all my own information, and just a work fax number, which I think I previously entered when I had to create the NPI several years back. Do I need a different one for my own business? This NPI is listed as an individual provider NPI, and does not list my employer, but it’s the only NPI I’ve ever had.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was told when I started to create a type 2 NPI for the business (I have an LLC) if you plan on providing super bills for your patients to seek reimbursement. Then you use that instead of your personal NPI. While the type 1 does stay with you, it can get tricky if you’re working for other businesses under that NPI as well.

> **Response 2:** Elaine, no you do not need a new one, this one goes with you!  If you decide to work with Medicare you will need an NPI 2.

I really didn’t find anything helpful in the practice act, and when I reached out to them, they responded that they cannot provide legal advice. I’m assuming this means we do not, but I want to double check. TIA!

Does anyone teach yoga or perform reiki outside PT clinic for extra money?  My understanding is we are always held to highest degree as a PT so would malpractice insurance as a PT still cover this? If cash based, Do you have to have an llc or just malpractice insurance?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You might want to check your PT insurance as to what it covers and doesn’t. You can get Reiki insurance though too, and is affordable at approximately $100 a year.  
I don’t know the answer to the license question.

> **Response 2:** I’m in the process of making a PLLC for a business that involves both of those modalities. I was advised to make the PLLC as an added layer of legal protection. I’m in texas, so PLLC required as a licensed professional vs. LLC. That’s different state to state. I have not looked directly into the insurance yet. I do know that I will need a different policy as an individual wellness practitioner vs. where I’m at currently employee of hospital system.

Hey y'all! 
I'm still taking baby steps to start my mobile PT practice. 
What kind of Business NPI do I need? I'm sure that it shouldn't be Organization NPI, as I'm the only therapist for now. 
Also, what happens when I hire someone in the future, do I need new organization NPI then? 
Thanks! 
As always, Keep rocking 🤘

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The organization NPI which is a type 2 will be attached to your business no matter how many employees you have or don’t have. The type 1 NPI is attached to you as a clinician. I have both because I bill insurance under my type 2 even though it’s just me and no employees. If you are cash only then a type 1 is usually enough.

For those of you with two businesses (PT pllc and one wellness LLC) how did you go about liability insurance? Two separate policies? One umbrella with both companies? Preference for liability companies for either one or both of these? CM&F raised their rates so curious 

Also, what are you selecting for your wellness profession? Wellness counselor? And does your policy cover courses AND Telehealth sessions? Lost puppy, please help 🐶

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What did you end up doing?

> **Response 2:** I have considered this and spoken to one of their reps previously. It seems like you will always want the professional liability to protect your license either way. Regarding their other insurance options, they do have various categories, but I question the necessity since it's mainly about protecting your professional standing. For example, I was considering hiring someone for coaching, but if they are unlicensed it hardly seems necessary. Alternative insurance might be more appropriate like general or umbrella or some different category depending on the specifics.

Hello all! I’ve been uncaged for 8 months now working out of my in-home clinic setting. Business is growing, leading me on a search for locations so I can hire to accommodate the growing caseload. I have a couple questions and would greatly appreciate any guidance. 

1. Where can I go about finding brick & mortar facility requirements? I currently run a hybrid practice (cash pay, BCBS, Healthchoice). Uncertain if that fact changes any regulations for my facility. As a subcomponent to this question- do I need to have any additional internet security? I currently use HIPAA compliant EMR, fax, and email. Is this sufficient?

2. Are there any great articles or resources that highlight steps to take in regards to hiring a PRN employee?

I greatly appreciate any insight. The questions answered and resources provided in this group have been my lifeline over the past several months! So thankful for this community!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1. Not many requirements to my knowledge. If you want to be ADA compliant you can find the entire ADA handbook to ensure compliance. 
No additional internet security required. What you have is sufficient. 

2. I called my tax preparer to find out legally what needed to be written up / completed upon hiring. Basically an offer letter and tax forms (I can share with you but probably state dependent)

I do really want my space to be ADA compliant but I just got renovation estimates and they are pretty costly. I do know a portion of that is tax deductible. This will be a small PT clinic with 3-4 employees maximum. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ADA requires that health care entities provides full and equal access for people with disabilities. Private practice falls under Title III of the ADA.

All it takes is one disgruntled person filing a complaint.

I believe you can ask for time to complete the projects.

I’m looking to add a 1099 independent contractor for my mobile practice. From my understanding, I just need the following:

1) contract 
2) Medicare reassignment of benefits to my company 
3) W9
4) Malpractice (professional liability) insurance

A few questions:

I already have general liability (for my business) and professional liability (for myself). Does the independent contractor that I am contracting need to have his/her professional liability insurance? Do I need to add them under my company’s liability insurance or is it enough for them to have their own?

Is this list all that I need? Or am I missing something?

We had a prospective patient reach out to us today who is hearing impaired. Requesting a ASL interpreter, saying that if we don’t have one on staff, we are required to provide one at our expense per ADA laws. The cost will be about $40 more than the whole session would reimburse. Does anyone have any experience with this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ADA Title III (for private providers): Physical therapy offices are "places of public accommodation." They must ensure effective communication by furnishing auxiliary aids and services, including qualified sign language interpreters, unless it causes an undue burden (significant difficulty or expense, considering the provider's resources)

If you are a very small clinic you could make the argument that it would cause and undue burden and offer to help find a clinic that can accommodate

> **Response 2:** If the clinic doesn’t receive any federal funding, I don’t think you “have to.” So if you accept Medicaid or Medicare, I think you do. If you were say private pay or private insurance only I don’t think you have to. Not a lawyer but that is my understanding…

When getting liability insurance to start my own LLC, how much coverage is needed? (OT private home based practice)

Per incident limit: 500,000 vs 1,000,000
Aggregate limit 1 vs 3 vs 6,000,000

And do I need the general liability added? 

Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go for the bigger one.

> **Response 2:** What matters most is YOUR comfort level of coverage.  You SHOULD have coverage. As an OT (or PT), the likelihood of you "getting into trouble" is very very slim. Still, get coverage.  Could you go with $500K and $1M and no general? Sure.  Does that make YOU comfortable with your coverage? Only you know the answer

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not kidding: Double your rate. 
This was actually advised to me by a P. I. lawyer.  
When the case settles, the lawyer IS going to “request” that you take a 50% reduction in your reimbursement, because “We didn’t get as much in the settlement and everyone needs to be paid”

> **Response 2:** I was burned a couple times and didn't receive any payment from liens. I found it too much of a headache to try to collect from the patient after the fact so now I won't treat on lien agreements.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Most people will say you only need personal coverage when you are solo. CM&F will do personal policy and cover your LLC as an additional entity as long as you stay solo. That’s what I did since HPSO wouldn’t cover my PLLC without going to the higher group coverage rate.

> **Response 2:** I just purchased through CM&F exactly as mentioned above! Professional and general and added LLC as additional covered entity

For those who have brought someone for extra coverage- maternity or vacation, did you pay as a 1099? What about liability insurance? I’m currently making preparations for when u start maternity leave in roughly 2 to 2.5 months. One of the perspective PTs I spoke with does not carry her own personal liability insurance, she’s covered by her current employer. I’m going to look into my business coverage to see if it would cover her/what I would take to cover her.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you have liability for the company, some let you add 1 therqpist at no extra charge.  At least CM& F does.  Also, I would look into paying for her liability coverage.  If it's part time hours or per diem, it may be inexpensive.  Ask her to do the same.  Maybe pay part of it.  Be creative with negotiating.

> **Response 2:** What Evelyn Capdevila  said.  Also,  I paid as 1099 PRN offered higher rate as they would also be accepting payments and scheduling

Hi all!  I have a patient that was injured and involved in a lawsuit.  She sent me this: "The outcome that my lawyer wanted is the "Disability Rating Scale"". I did standardized testing (Minn Rate, Purdue, Strength Testing w/norms for age, gender, dominance, and she completed UEFI/Q-DASH) and wrote a report with those findings.  Is there a "disability rating scale" for physical injuries that I am missing that this attorney needs?  Thank you in advance!

Malpractice insurance questions…

I currently have HPSO, but have heard about CM&F being better priced. 

1. Has anyone had CM&F? Have you ever switched from HPSO?
2. I own my own practice and practice out of my home, and others. Is there another insurance I should be having besides malpractice?
3. Can someone tell me if it is best to pay for “claims made” policy or “occurrence” policy and what? The price different is large and I’m wondering what is so beneficial about the occurrence?

Thank you SO much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HPSO has changed for the worse and I cannot recommend them at all. They just raised me 50%, their website is archaic, the customer service is awful. Been with them for 15 years and I am switching once this period is up and I only renewed because they made an error and canceled my policy for no reason and I had to be insured. Please stay away.

Will I then be legally allowed to treat a patient that’s reaching out to me or do I need to do anything else first?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Amazing info and encouragement you have all shared! Thank you so much!! I have the same questions! I actually have operated as a sole prop with professional liability insurance (HPSO) through the state of NV, and have contracted out services with a middle man who then contracts out with school systems, home health agencies, etc (licensed in a few different states but area of residence is in NV). I am wanting to branch out and start seeing clients myself as opposed to contracting through a middle man in a hybrid remote/mobile manner - trying to decide if I want to continue operating as a sole prop or an LLC. Anyone have thoughts here? Threw a lot out here, but any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!

Liability insurance question. I am a small Neuro based private practice￼- brick and mortar with 1 full time and 2 per diem therapist. I had HPSO  last year as I was single and I paid around $1100 for general and professional. This year for annual renewal, because I added 2 per diem therapist it  increased it to $3000. I checked with CM&F and it is coming out about $1340- General and professional. I am inclined to go with CM&F but just checking here to see if i am missing something. ￼￼￼any advice will be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you.

Happy Friday!  I have a superbill question. I’m a solo practitioner in a cashed based clinic. I have a type 2 NPI listed on my super bills and had a client reach out today asking I correct 2 super bills to include my individual NPI per her insurance request.  I’ve never used my individual NPI in 4 years so wondering if this is a mistake from her insurance or if I should have included it this whole time?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi! So I literally had this come up yesterday except insurance was trying to have the patient use my NPI type 1 to see me in network prior to seeing me. I called and explained that I would be billing under NPI type 2. They understood (which I was surprised about) and would call them and let them know they could only use me as OON. So maybe if they want both NPIs, list one as “billing NPI”.

> **Response 2:** Superbill or CMS 1500 should include NPI 2 as billing NPI and individual NPI as rendering provider

**Community Responses:**

The noncompete may be active but may not be enforceable. Like if you can’t work in all of NYS that is not enforceable.

Does anyone here see cash pay patients without having a company started? Can you treat someone with simply having a license?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The reason why most people establish a company is for insurance and tax purposes.  You will still have to report and pay taxes on your earnings no matter how you personally take it in.  And you need liability insurance as well

> **Response 2:** You technically can as a sole proprietor without establishing an LLC or other business (depends on your state). Definitely need liability insurance for yourself.

Most will advise to establish your company though for liability protection against your personal assets in case something happens. You don’t want to risk personal things in the rare event something happens.

My CM&F insurance premium went up 30% in one year (this is my first year renewing). It gave reasons for increase that include: change in profession, address change, or starting your own clinic. All of which are not true. Has anybody had any success in disputing this? I’ve read through other posts about other insurance groups and will be seeking other quotes!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I switched to CM&F 4 years ago because they were the best rate and had at least a 20% increase this year. I got quotes from a few other companies this year and with their increases CM&F still remained the cheapest option.

> **Response 2:** Ours went up 30% and they couldn’t give me a single reason why. Still the cheapest option unfortunately.

Is anyone willing to share the documents that are a mist to get a business off and running and to be covered

Thank you in advance for the advice and help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Nicole Roth- Molinaro !.  I use HPSO.  I think I only had to provide my license number and TIN, but it's been awhile, so I don't really recall.

> **Response 2:** I just set mine up. I got general liability for my business and professional liability. I went through CM&F because I could get a part time rate. It is expensive though, at least more than I expected. CM&F includes sexual misconduct in their plan, others it is an additional charge. I was instructed if I was working with any minors to get that coverage. Had difficulty finding a company that would cover my PT, CPR training and reiki. The only other one I could find that did part time (since I have another part time PT job) was going to need to have a separate policy for my PT which meant an additional charge.

I know this has been asked before, but I can’t find it… best professional liability PLUS general liability insurance for solo practitioners?  The company I rent space from is now requiring general liability insurance…. I was paying $240/year with CM&F for just professional liability and when I asked if general liability was included, they said no, and gave me a quote that this next year would jump to $840 for both! 😳. Is this on par with what I’d find anywhere else? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I dont know how you got proff liability for $240. Mine is renewing at ~$725 for both through cmf this year and was about $650 last year.

> **Response 2:** What I found out recently is that there can be a huge difference in what is covered, thus the difference in pricing. Often the lesser priced insurance covers only gross negligence and malpractice in their professional coverage.

Hey friends! I'm a PT at a private cash-based neuro clinic. I do not own the clinic. 

We have had 2 separate clients in the last two weeks ask if it would be possible for one of the therapists to come to their home and help them with swimming in their personal pools. 

While I do think this could be hugely beneficial, of course there could be liability in conflicts of interest. Both clients have specifically reported that they would still come to our clinic for physical therapy outside of the pool but would want pool therapy a couple times to make themselves and/or their caregivers or family members more comfortable and assisting them in and out of the pool. 

Thoughts? My first concern is of course just liability reasons, but I would love to find a way to help these particular clients with this in a legal and ethical way. 

Any assistance or advice appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** *Maintain or obtain personal liability insurance that will cover you on client property. *Obtain proper certification for aqua therapy and/or swim and water safety training. (So many online options)
*Create an LLC for your “company” . 
*Inform your employer if you choose that you will be offering these services to them as a separate entity to the neuro PT.
*You can probably do all of the above steps in a day.

> **Response 2:** Not sure what state you live in, but in NH, if outpatient services are delivered in the home…a homecare license is required. It requires a lengthy application process and then annual renewal with an audit/survey process. I would look into any similar requirements with DHHS in your state. We have a clinic as well, so we have to assign the site of service as home or clinic for each visit. Our EMR lets us assign the site of service when we schedule the patient.

ASKING FOR ADVICE FOR SOLO PRACTICE OUTREACH

I am a year out from PT school at my first job with a dream of having my own solo practice - as of right now, just starting to see patients as a side gig would be amazing. I am currently drafting an email to a gym I go to to hopefully establish a rapport and discuss a collaboration - having a PT on-site either for actual treatment or for more educational/screening sessions. Gives me some exposure and gives the gym an extra service to their clients.

I am always nervous about legal stuff, and marketing myself. So would you guys say it is safe to just dive in - if so what is the best way to approach with said email? Or would it be necessary/prudent to first form an LLC? I have professional liability insurance. I would make this a cash-based venture, most likely basic and very affordable to start until the ball really starts rolling. 

I just feel like there is so much to think about. It if I don’t just START I’ll never make it happen.

thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To protect yourself and your assets, yes form a LLC first.  It’s a pretty simple process. Some states may require PLLC so check on that.  I would also create a business banking account, and consent forms at the bare minimum.

Question about adding providers:

We are a physical therapy cash pay clinic. To help offset rent and add to our services we are looking to add other providers like massage therapists, dieticians, mental performance coaches etc. 

Does anyone know if we need to do anything legally from a business point of view? We are a single member LLC. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There may be some rules in your state business laws that you need to investigate first. Each state is so different. Some states do have regulations related to offering multiple professional services (for which the state provides professional licenses) under a particular business structure. Once that is clarified you can then look at other factors that come into play. As mentioned above practice acts related to referrals etc. Then once you have reviewed all of those rules then you need to look at Professional Liability coverage as well as general liability coverage issues. You should get a few quotes: CMF, HSPO, Proliability. Proliability has generally provided the most cost-effective options but not always. Then the next question becomes the financial aspects of will this actually be profitable. What does this really look like?

> **Response 2:** Liability insurance umbrella policy for your staff. CM&F is the cheapest I have found

I called myPTinsurance to inquire about liability coverage. 

They have 2 options: 

$297/yr for self-employed and 
$149/yr for employed. 

It only covers the clinician and not the practice/LLC. 

There is literally no difference in the policy coverage in those 2 options as per the person who spoke with me. 

I asked in different ways of why someone would pay more if there is no difference in the coverage. She was very casual about pick whichever you want. 🤯 

Does anyone know if there is any difference in self-employed policy vs employed? 

I further asked if there was ever a claim then do you provider legal guidance and she said we don’t provider any legal guidance. You just submit your claim to the claims department. 

I am wondering if she was a new employee on the call who has no idea how to answer the call when a new client calls. 

Looking for any helpful information I can get from this group. 

Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are self-employed this would be your only coverage, so in the event of an incident, this company would be the sole coverage, so they charge more to cover that potential cost. If you are employed, you are likely covered by your employer’s liability insurance also, and if the incident occurred during the time you are working for them, that would cover the majority of the cost. This coverage would be secondary

> **Response 2:** I second CM&F. 

If you are working for someone else, they should have a liability umbrella policy for the business. In that case you would purchase supplemental insurance as an employed person.

If you are running your own business then you need coverage for yourself and the business. That would be professional and general liability. That is self-employed insurance.

For a company covering me if I do soldering wrong or accidentally cause damage or an injury, I want them knowing what they’re doing and what they’re talking about. myPTinsurance always looked to good to be true. They also never had enough information to make it look legit.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The Town and Village Clerk's offices have records of local ordinances.  That may be a place to start. Do you see any hair stylists, accountants, chiropractors etc practicing out of their homes?
Also, if you still carry a mortgage on the home check the wording. Mine has a clause regarding business on the property. Hopefully you get green lights!

> **Response 2:** You can call your city or town hall. Asked to be directed towards business licensing. You should also check with your state licensing issuing body. They may have different rules. ￼

Hi uncaged clinicians! For those of you with a mobile practice (virtual office/buisness address) how do you indicate that with Medicare? When I applied for a Type 2 NPI-organizational NPI, they asked for a primary practice location where services are being rendered. My services offered are outpatient occupational therapy in patient’s homes. What do I put as the primary practice address? My virtual office?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When enrolling with Medicare you can designate yourself as mobile only. Your “correspondence address” can be your home address, office or wherever you do the administrative part of owning a business.

> **Response 2:** I’m not sure about the type 2 NPI question. It’s been a long time since I went thru that process.

Cash based/superbill question…

I have a friend who is just starting out.  She has malpractice coverage but does not have her LLC yet.  She has a patient that wants to see her asap.  The patient wants to submit a superbill to her insurance for potential reimbursement.
Can the patient submit if the PT doesn’t have a business tax ID yet?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, the PT can treat using a SS # as a tax Id and never even apply for a LLC. Not the advised route due to liability but absolutely can be done.

> **Response 2:** As above. Will also use her personal NPI only on the bill

Hi! I’m looking for insurance guidance. What types of insurance and how much coverage? I need someone with more experience! 

I started a LLC and will be doing mobile outpatient visits, personal training/wellness, and eventually will have Pilates/a physical location.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Everyone is different and needs are different; but we use CM&F group; was significantly cheaper and easier to work with than HPSO (which is usually the APTA referral partner)  

It does not matter what type of services you are offering wellness/PT or personal training they aren't going after the service they would be going after you and the business so you are protecting that.  
You will need liability insurance; if you are contracting with insurance providers they usually require a 1M/3M policy minimum, some are higher.   
General liability insurance if you have a physical space, and if you do not own it the lease agreement usually spells out what is/is not covered and how much insurance they require you to carry. 
Cybersecurity insurance for malware or ransomware attacks- most dont get this, but I see this becoming a requirement by all federal payers soon. 

If you are doing mobile visits you will want to make sure your umbrella policy covers incidental damage to someones home etc and or a rider to cover you for accident damage such as busting up a wall or breaking a vase etc... 

You have an LLC set up, perfect, do make sure you have a business bank account; and set up a retirement account for your business ASAP;  keep your business finances separate from your personal life. separation of church and state... if you're solo and have no employees a soloK is the way to go; whether Roth or traditional qualified-- depends on your earnings, expected earnings tax brackets etc. .. discuss with your CPA or financial advisor. 

Happy to answer any other question you have. 
Im a DPT that is also a licensed financial advisor

We have a mobile group practice and our current policy at CM&F is due soon. All of our employees are W2. We have a mix of full time, part time, and PRN. CM&F doesn't discern between each and our policy is scheduled to go up quite a lot ($3628 from $2205). HPSO is laughable at $9750.
Does anyone use a group liability insurance that they've found cheaper? Does anyone use a liability insurance that notes between FT, PT, and PRN? I feel like we shouldn't be paying the same for someone seeing 30 visits per week vs 4...
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I switched from CM&F to Berxi in the summer and was really happy. They take each therapists' weekly hours into account when quoting. I'm in the same boat as you (also mobile, mix of PT and OT) with some very part time staff and more full time staff and this was the most reasonable one. I'm in Maryland if that is a factor.

Hi everyone, I’m planning on opening my mobile pelvic health business in mid June. I currently have a noncompete agreement that my lawyer has advised me not to worry too much about because of the new FTC ruling.

My main question regards a patient of mine who I have treated on and off for the better part of 3 years. The next closest pelvic health clinician is located about 30 min away, and she has spoken to me multiple times about not wanting to see anyone else due to the chronic and very personal nature of her issues. 

I will preface this by saying that I don’t want to poach patients, at all. I’m not planning on telling any of my patients where I’m going because I don’t want to steal business from my current employer. But I’m not sure what to say to this specific patient because I know she will want to follow me (and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want her to!). Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this?? More than anything I’m afraid of it someone getting back to my administrators that I told a patient where I was going, knowing she would leave with me. I’m already nervous about starting my own business with an active noncompete agreement, and I don’t want to add fuel to the fire.

Thanks everyone!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have always told my patients if they ever need to contact me, down the road and I am no longer at that clinic or they are looking for a specialty PT to check the APTA website for find a PT. Did that long before starting my own practice. Surprising how many patients remembered and looked me up years after treating them.

> **Response 2:** The bigger issue than the non compete is a non solicit agreement that is likely in your contract. 

My suggestion would be this, go to the owner of the company you currently work for and let them decide. It should be their decision to let you take a patient.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I haven't done it yet (since I haven't filled up a sharps container yet); but I've heard most pharmacies and even some emergency departments will take them as long as the needles are in the appropriate container.  I've been told this is where say, diabetics, turn in their insulin needles.  I would just call ahead first.

Quick question for anyone who buys liability insurance.
I have CM & F liability insurance and am about to renew. Since I only only do up to 25 sessions (on a busy week), I am categorized as working 24 hours or less, which saves me some money on the yearly premium?

Anyone else do similar, or do you say you work full time?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Anonymous member, you are correct, you only need your NPI 1.  You do not have to go and update anything because you are cash ONLY,  but, if you want to take FSA/HSA cards, you have to set up your, lets say, Square card reader as "healthcare" or whatever option it gives you to be able to swipe those cards...  Does that make sense?

Thank you for your feedback and information !

As a PT ( mobile out patient ) , can I add weight loss program and have a nutritionist work with me for private client..

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d make sure you are working with a registered dietitian rather than a nutritionist. Many states only allow RDs to legally provide meal plans, and all states only allow RDs to do medical nutrition therapy of medical conditions, which obesity can fall under. RDs are licensed professionals with a formal education and licensure just like us. Nutritionist is an unregulated term in many states, so literally anyone with either no education or with a 2 hour online certification can claim to be a nutritionist. Working with an RD would keep you safely within the law and offer much higher quality!

> **Response 2:** does your state practice act and liability insurance allow it ???

Hey everyone, I have a question about a lawyer requesting notes. We have been treating a patient for a few months now and the patient was in a car accident in December. Our treatment diagnosis is unrelated to his car accident. His lawyer wants us to send him our notes, which are completely unrelated to the car accident. However, the lawyer is telling the patient to request the notes and gave the patient an email for us to send them to rather than sending us a formal request. I told the patient to tell the lawyer that he needs to send a formal request and then we will send the notes. Does anyone know the legality behind this? I should not just send these notes to the lawyers email without a request, correct?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The records technically belong to the patient.  If you make the patient sign a medical records release form (just to protect you), you can give them to the patient and they can give them willingly to whomever they please.

> **Response 2:** Tell the lawyer , via the email your patient gave you, to send you a medical records release signed by the patient /client releasing the records to their lawyer .

Do we have to provide clients with a form with info about HIPPA? And consent for services? A credit card authorization form? Consent form for telepractice? Trying to figure out if it’s worth purchasing a package of forms offered to private practice SLPs for $347.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance - expert advice - the forms are of no use unless there are corresponding polices, procedures & processes in place.  

For example: HIPAA is a federal law - with significant requirements... having a patient "acknowledge" receipt of "your" Notice of Privacy Practices is of no value is you don't have policies governing all the privacy practice, patient instructions on how to access their privacy rights, etc.

Hey all I had a third party auditer reach out and request medical records for an Aetna Medicare client. They have said that it is not a payment audit and are just collecting records for documentation quality. Is this standard practice? Has anyone else had this occur?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance Yes, it is standards practice, and Advantage Plans are required to submit data to CMS in support of their "risk adjustment" scores (how they are paid based on patient severity). If you have a contract  - it will be identified in the contract as cooperating w/quality review, or similar verbiage.

Any Massachusetts PTs here who can tell me if we need a PLLC in our state- or if an LLC is enough? I tried Mass.gov and the Board of Allied Health, and the latter told me I should seek legal advice.

Looking for advice: my business partner and I are opening our first clinic and looking to contract with some insurances. We applied for Aetna and were sent a “provider agreement” it was very vague, not identifying CPT codes, no fee schedule etc. We called to see if this was our final contract and were told “no this is just the first step and after we credential you then you get your final contract and can negotiate.” We got an email saying we’re part of the network and provided an effective date but no further contract details. We called today and were told that the “provider agreement” is the final contract and we should have requested the fee schedule and asked to negotiate before signing, that the other info provided was incorrect. We feel silly because this is our first go with all of this and we were provided incorrect info. Does anyone know if we can void the contract before the effective date and start again or are we stuck with just having agreed to whatever Aetna wants to pay us? (we requested they send a fee schedule but haven’t gotten it yet) Any advice is appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No need to feel silly and try not to beat yourselves up they intentionally do this to trip people up. I call it weaponized incompetence. When you’re just starting you’re bound to make mistakes. 

You may want to consider asking your state association if they have any advice they usually have pretty good relationships with ppl at the insurance carriers. 

ASH tried pulling something similar with me. They told me everything was square sent over the contract however they conveniently only sent over the pages that I had to sign and left out all of the important details of the contract. Luckily I caught it and forced them to send over everything. 

Honestly you can probably just chalk this one up as a learning experience. Never trust anything an insurance carrier tells you and get everything in writing with reference numbers and names.

> **Response 2:** if the agreement doesn’t work for you and you can’t renegotiate, would simply not taking a referral from them works? Assuming you are working on other contracts as well.

Anyone willing to share a sample of a contract you have with a space you are renting? For example, we are renting the pool in an athletic club.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance #Pool #AquaticTherapy - Does your client base include Medicare, or other federal healthcare programs?

There are specific contract requirements in that instance.  Given associated risks (pools), the contract must be specific to a number of different areas, including safety. [as well as pool regulations in your state].  A generic contract for use of space is not generally the best to use for pools....

So have finally registered my LLC and got EIN. Step one done. Yeaaa🎊

Now, I already had Porfessional liability insurance before creating my business LLC. Now, do I need to get another insurance for LLC or do I need to add the LLC name on the insurance or what are my options? This will be cash based mobile practice only. 

Also, do I need to get business tax receipt from every city/county I see the patients in? Would that be under name or LLC? I am in palm beach county, Florida to be precise. 

Any input/guidance highly appreciated.🙏🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just call your insurance company and they'll advise you on that if they do business or you need to go elsewhere. 
Yes you'll need to do all the things for each county unfortunately. And always under business name, everything under business not personal.

> **Response 2:** Go to city website & county website-  city is done first where your business address is.  Then county covers the mobile part

Does anyone have a resource for a lawyer to look at a non-compete for me? My company was acquired by another so I'm unsure if it is still valid. Thats the main thing holding me back from starting my practice.  I just got quoted $600 from a local attorney to take a look. Im in Pennsylvania

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Non-competes don’t really hold up in a lot of states. Especially if you can make an argument that it keeps you from making a living. Also when the clinic I was working for was acquired they presented us with a new contract and non-compete as the old one was void with the acquisition. If you havnt signed a new one, maybe this is a perfect opportunity to go out on your own. I guess you can check with a lawyer if your concerned.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You would need to check with your livability insurance to see if it covers that but usually that’s an additional fee. Mostly used by social workers or therapists that work with children. I’d opt for public transportation or however they would get to the store without therapy.

Hello all you awesome “uncaged clinicians”! I am currently working on “unlocking my cage” and stepping out into starting/owning a private practice outpatient ortho clinic. 

My question is: are non-compete agreements enforceable? Can my current outpatient  company file legal action against me if I “break” my non-compete agreement? 

I know a new law was recently passed regarding non-competes and goes into affect September 4th that basically states non-competes are no longer enforceable. 

Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

With that being said, we do contract with the waiver system Didd. And we are also applying for the TEIS. And then eventually in school.

Hi all, I'm registering for a PLLC. Do I have to have the words "Physical Therapy" in the company name, or can it be just "PT?"

I'm in New York.

On the ny.gov website, it states the following: 

A certificate pursuant to Business Corporation Law, section 1503 (b) (ii) may be issued when:
1. the proposed name of the corporation appropriately describes the profession practiced and the services to be provided; and

Your application will be rejected if you do not submit an explanation for words used in your entity name that are: initials, foreign words, surnames, abbreviations or words not commonly used in connection with the profession(s) being practiced ([Business Corporation Law, Article 15](https://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=%24%24BSC1503%24%24%40TXBSC01503+&LIST=LAW+&BROWSER=EXPLORER+&TOKEN=27738319+&TARGET=VIEW); [Regulations of the Commissioner of Education, Part 59, Section 59.10](https://www.op.nysed.gov/title8/regulations-commissioner-education/part-59#psc); [Board of Regents Rule 29.1](https://www.op.nysed.gov/title8/rules-board-regents/part-29)).

... but I don't see a space to explain what the initials PT mean.

And  I also found this on the nysed.gov website:

Guideline 2: Advertising and Specialty Credentials

The initials used in connection with a licensed physical therapist's or physical therapist assistant’s name are "P.T." or "P.T.A." Although an individual can include the academic degree in one’s signature, these designations are neither recognized nor protected by Education Law or the Rules of the Regents. The title should be listed first after the person’s name, i.e., Jane Smith, PT, MSPT, DPT, OCS.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In New York, YES.  Your name must include “Physical Therapy”

Hey guys! I had a question I was hoping I might be able to get a little feedback on. I have my own LLC and subcontract through another therapist as a cash based provider. My wife works PRN for a pediatic clinic (and has her own liability insurance) and she recently had a couple patients parents ask her if she could come to their house after their insurance ran out and pay her out of pocket. If I wanted her to see patients under my LLC in their homes, what things from a legal aspect would I need to have in place? I spoke to an accountant who said since we file our taxes jointly she doesn’t need a 1099 and we can just collect both our money in the business account and pay ourselves like I do for myself. Does this sound correct?

For those mobile PTs (mostly geriatrics) doing wellness--  I want to add a service of driving people to appointments to help advocate/or just get them there. Or even to a store to work on fun fitness walking.  I have talked with 2 different insurance agents.  They both said the insurance is crazy expensive, avoid it.  No one has actually given me a quote though.   They said to medical  appointments, it would be considered a medical transport service.  Does anyone do this?     How?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You would need additional licenses to set up a medical transportation business depending on the state you’re in, as well as other inspections for your vehicle to be ADA compliant etc. 

I have done PT sessions outside of the home where I met the patient at Walmart for example and worked on dynamic balance/functional mobility etc. But I didn’t provide transportation due to the additional liability and compliance requirements.

I currently was/am a travel PT. I am off contract right now. However, due to personal reasons I am not leaving a specific area right now until at least June 2026. This is not my tax home area. I am struggling to find a travel contract in this area I am in and may have to settle for PRN in a SNF as there are literally no full time jobs unless you want to work in an OP mill.

 I specialize in pelvic health and I am considering offering some virtual sessions with it leading to possible mobile depending how well it goes in the meantime. I know wherever my partner and I go next (based on his job) it will be a larger city and I will be able to open my own brick and mortar eventually.

Due to only being in this area for about 8 more months I do not want to go through the hassle of doing all this LLC paperwork and then we move to a different city or to a completely different state. If I was to do virtual or mobile can I do it as a sole prop with liability insurance through CM&F? Then file an LLC wherever we go next?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The structure of the business is usually state specific, so you'll have to look up the laws and see if they will accept a healthcare provider filing as a sole proprietor.

You could also look at virtual positions with hinge health or other online platforms.

I am an approved CE provider through NCBTMB. I have 8 classes approved right now. I’m looking to make the upgrade to becoming an approved organization, in which case I can bring on additional Instructors. Do you have suggestions on finding resources for making an Instructor handbook? Or for making the legal contract with instructor expectations and agreements and to protect my intellectual property?

Thank you.

Hi everyone- can anybody help me woth this? When I started my cash pay business, I created a type 2 NPI. Do I need to cancel all of my insurance contracts through my type 1 NPI?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The short answer is no. If you give superbills, you will provide your type 2 NPI (business entity) and then your type 1 (provider) as the rendering provider. The insurance company will recognize it as out of network.

Liability insurance..... 

The only options I see who offer group coverage is HPSO, CM&F, and American Professional (which is currently not writing any new policies for PT BTW). The other 2 continue to increase rates as insurance companies tend to do. 

Anyone know of any other options that will insure the business and not just personal policies?

Does a 1099 still have to have their NPI registered to my business? I’m assuming yes

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes for Medicare.

> **Response 2:** Think of an NPI as a ss#.  You can work for numerous companies and report taxes within a timeframe.

Similarly, an NPI can be associated with multiple corporations and self employment simultaneously.

If you are curious about skirting contractual obligations it comes down to a tax id.  Be prepared with clear distinctions and paper trail, starting with client signatures on some kind of form explaining the out of network agreement for specific hours, days, locations, niche services etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** As a practicing PT in Florida I know for us, the HIV/AIDS was a one-time requirement only. And medical errors is required every renewal period.. but I can't speak for those obtaining a license in Florida from another state. They should have the information on the FPTA website

PLLC set up for NY State questions:
Does the name need to have Physical Therapy in it , if so,  can it be abbreviated to PT or must it be spelled out?
Does the NYS.gov have a master list so I can look up to see if the choices I thought of have been taken?
Do the folks with mobile PT plus wellness plus any other training or non medical issues use 2 separate PLLCs or can it be combined into a name like : "XXX PT health and wellness"
TIA!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in NY and recently opened up my private OT practice. The LLC had to have OT in it, but you can register a DBA for whatever name you want. However, I believe for tax purposes, you need to keep it through your LLC name. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** The corp must have the professional license in the name in your case being “Physical Therapy” however I believe you can file a DBA after the corp is formed that does not require the name to be in it. Another option would be to trademark a name/logo and brand the practice under that. 

You can go to the NY dept. of state and perform an entity search of the name that you are looking for and it will show all registered NYS businesses.

Questions for starting a mobile practice (specifically in Tennessee), and apologies if they are common sense questions, business/taxes/billing are NOT my strong suite and I'm working on that: 

1. Is an LLC required? I had an accountant say I would be better operating as a DBA initially. (I don't have any big assets in my name, they are all in my husband's name, not sure if that is relevant). 
1. Do I need a business license? 
1. NPI #- I plan to be cash based only. Can I operate under my personal NPI # from my previous employer or do I need to get a type 2 NPI for business? What about if I want to provide a superbill?
1. For TN, direct access has a 90-day window and states we must refer out if they are not making progress. We also must contact physician after 90 days, does this apply with cash based practice too? What is the goal when contacting the physician if we are not needing to request more visits or provide progress note etc. 

TIA!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi! I'm in Knoxville and just started my mobile practice in October so I have some answers but not many haha.
1. I just went ahead and did the LLC from the start, but you could also just do a sole proprietorship. I don't believe it's required, but not 100% sure on that.
2. I was told we do not need a business license for the state of TN as long as we are not selling goods.
3. I have seen different answers on what type of NPI so I'm not sure. As for now, I only have my personal NPI bc it's just me in the practice. 
4. Some advice in this group is that reaching out to the MD is a sort of marketing tool. I believe it's required even if cash-based, but again I'm not 100% sure. 

Sorry my answers are not great, hope they help a bit!

Clarity around this. 

Super new business owner- 100% cash-based mobile PT.  Do not have any plans to prrixopate with insurance any time soon. Do I need a clinic/
Business NPI and or business liability insurance ( beyond what I have personally)?

**Community Responses:**

I consulted with lawyers (yes, multiple) when preparing to launch and CM&F was highly recommended.

Starting up 

Get LLC

Get insurance? I see alot of people recommending cm&f. If I am only providing care in other people's homes do I need liability? 

Paperwork for clients to sign? 

Plan to only offer in home personal training at this time. So I don't need to worry about Medicare age patients despite my DPT, correct? 

Any other recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had my CA and NV license before getting my AZ license and it was a pain in the butt😅. Everything is on the Arizona board of PT site. It’s verrrry tedious and confusing. Need to do the jurisprudence test, fingerprints, etc. took them about 4 months to process me after I finally called and emailed nonstop bc my company needed me to be out there already. My company recently had someone get a Utah license first bc it was easier and then use compact to get the AZ license, took a lot faster 😆

Wondering how many people have hired their own registered agent vs be their own and have their home address as their business address and available to the public? At $125/year and only planning this as a side gig seems expensive. Trying to set up my PLLC in Kentucky, but don’t have have KY PT license yet. My main job is in Ohio, but I live in KY so can’t do compact either. I am a CPR instructor and have a definite lead on certifying coaches in CPR at a local school so want to start that first, already have all my manikins. I also have my Reiki II certification and liability insurance so ready to go with that. I want to see how these things go as a side gig before going for the PT as I plan to keep my part time PT position. Trying to keep costs at a minimum, but since I plan to be mobile, in KY I have to buy a city business license yearly for every city I work in. Feeling overwhelmed by all the business side of things. Totally confident in my ability to do what I plan to do.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To start I’m only seeing a couple patients and week and will be using my phone address. In a year when I do my annual report, if business is booming I’ll get a registered agent

My website is mainly information regarding what I do/my services but does have a “contact me” form asking for first and last name and email. I have my good faith estimate posted. I contacted my lawyer who recommended a privacy policy. Do I also need a terms & conditions as well as a “cookies” post where they can click “agree”? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes to all those. The privacy and terms pages are standard for all sites and if you don't have them Google may penalize your site in search. Same for cookies. 
Cookies are just a one click turn on in squarespace or wix, or a plugin in wordpress. The pages you can use rocket law for $39 to make (just text pages too, no design needed).

After year of following this  amazing group,  It’s my first time posting , but I have a question hoping someone has an answer based on experience !!!

getting ready to start a brick and mortar with a partner. We have location and we formed a co owned corp. 
We just received  a type 2 NPI , only one of us was named authorized official on NPPES. According to our crediting guy that’s the only way it could be done  on NPPES. 

My question is :
How can we associated the new corp and type 2 NpI with both of our personal NPI on PECOS? 
The partner used to apply for type 2 NPI ON NPPES will automatically have the new entity associated with  him , what about the other partner? 
Any help will be much appreciated

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Complete the reassignment application on PECOS. This would link each person to the business PTAN.

You can include ownership details for the type 2 NPI in your partnership/operating agreement for your business if you feel that’s necessary.

Hi! Starting a mobile PT LLC and had a few questions regarding applying for a group NPI. I plan to be contracted with Medicare. 1) Do I need a business NPI or can I use my individual NPI/are the pros/cons to applying for a group NPI? 2) when I went to apply for the NPI type 2(organization NPI) it was required to put down a practice location (physical address not a PO Box)… but what do you do if you are mobile and don’t have a location? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi, you will need a type 2 NPI to bill Medicare with your own business. When it comes to practice location you can either put your home address or set up a virtual location (I'm not too sure on how to do this as I just did my home address but it is an option). On the bright side having the type 2 NPI will allow you to get paid through your LLC which opens up all the possible tax advantages of owning a business vs being a W2 employee

Liability insurance question: If you have a corporation but are the sole employee/owner do you cover yourself with liability insurance as an individual or do you have to purchase liability as the corporation? It is much cheaper to purchase it at an individual rate....

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Call insurance carriers and ask them if they have the ability to cover you individually as well as your legal business entity as an additional covered entity.  I cannot speak to corporation versus LLC, but my carrier is able to cover me and my PLLC through the same plan.  The carriers are usually pretty good with giving you your options pending your business structure and state of operation.

Anyone have experience with setting up and developing a business as a Medicare Part B physical therapist provider? I got my NPI, but it seems that you need to register as a business provider in order to see Medicare B patients. Please correct me if I’m wrong…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So I help people regularly with this. You will need several things in place. Firstly you will need to have your state business license, then get an EIN. If it is not an LLC/PLLC (depends on your state) then you enroll as a sole prop. If an LLC/PLLC you will then apply for a Type 2 NPI. You then need to open a business bank account and have a bank letter or voided check. Make sure all the names match even to the commas. Once you have all that in place then you can start your application for credentialing with Medicare and to reassign your personal NPI to your business.

> **Response 1:** #HIPAA - what's needed, based on your question, is a review of HIPAA compliance related to the Privacy & Security Rules, and all attendant requirements under HIPAA for the "Workforce".  Any & all annual workforce training should be role specific to your practice.

Suggest "zero-basing" this question...

Quick question. If I am opening a solo private practice in a sublease location, I do not need a facility license, correct? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

We run a health and wellness practice with solely PTs. We are looking to partner/add on non healthcare individuals to help with sports performance, motivational team building workshops, and more. Most likely using them as indept contractors vs employees. 

What does this look like from a liability insurance perspective? Since they are not healthcare professionals they cannot be covered under our professional liability. 
What other recommendations for professional liability companies to cover them? 

Then recommendations on adding them to general liability? 

We are expanding health and wellness services outside the box of just PT.

Hi everyone, I'm an OT working towards starting my own business in Florida. I'm looking into liability insurance before I start seeing clients. Looks like there's a lot of options out there so I was wondering which company did you guys go with and why? Also, did you start with both professional liability and a business owners policy, or a general liability? I'm honestly not really sure what the difference is between general and business liability insurance. I'm looking for some guidance on this because this is all complicated to me. Thanks in advance!

I just recently started my own cash practice in WI. I do superbills in addition to accepting cash/card. 

Do I need to write progress notes or recertification notes? I’m not sure if this is for every patient, even cash based ones. I’m trying to find specifics for my practice act for WI, but having trouble. If someone wants to use superbills, should I do them for reimbursement? What about post surgical patients where I send notes to the doctor? 

Is it just forr medicare? Or all insurances?

Any clarity is appreciated. Thanks!

Hello all! I am in the process of landing a contract with a somewhat local district to where I live (it’s about an hour away). I initially wanted to serve this school 100% virtually. The school asked for a hybrid of 2 days in-person and then 3 days virtual. I was okay with this model and ready to accept. I just spoke with them again today after sending my contract and they are now wanting 3 days in-person and 2 days virtual. I really love my work from home days and don’t want to put too many miles on my car. I told the school I’d think about it and get back to them tomorrow. Does anyone have any additional pros and/or cons to me accepting their new terms? TIA!

NPI Type 2 APPLICATION 
I've seen Anthony Maritato's website for assistance however I thought we are supposed to select "Apply for an NPI for an organization" if you have a business. According to his website on how to apply for a Type 2 NPI, it appears that he selected "Apply for an NPI for another individual" because of this prompt (see photo attached). Can anyone confirm which one we're supposed to select? 

If "Apply for an NPI for an organization" --> we should be selecting "I am an Employee of the Organization"

Thanks in advance.

Hello Everyone!

I have just officially hired my first PT to my clinic! I have a few questions If anyone can help me. So they are a new graduate, they graduate end of May, take boards end of July. So my questions:

1. What all paperwork do I need them to fill out? Other than the basic, background check, tax forms, etc etc. Anything PT specific?
1. As far as general/personal liability insurance goes, I have CM&F liability for myself/clinic, am I able to add them into this? Or do I need to create a new plan for them?
1. If they take their boards in the state of Georgia, will they get their license fairly quickly?
1. Once their license comes in, can they start seeing patients the next day?
1. Do they need to make a CAQH profile? Can this be done now or has to be done after license number comes In?

This will be my first PT, if anyone has any other advice or what I may be missing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** in my state u need to let Work Comp know about the hire (if they are w2)

I have a patient that I see through the company I work for who is also asking to be seen extra, for cash, on other days not covered in her POC.  I would do this privately- in Texas.

1. Is this allowed
2. Can her dad who is a physician sign the POC (I’m in pediatrics). Or do I need to go through the original referring Dr.
3. I know I need a consent to treat, do I need a hippa form?

This is my first cash paying pt, so I appreciate the help.  I do have liability insurance, but do not have a LLC.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If your liability insurance is set-up like mine, standard policy only covers you at your full time W-2 job and a certain # of "moonlighting" hours at a second W-2 job. Probably does not cover you working 1099 or independently. I had to upgrade my policy to include coverage for self employed and 1099.

Think I got to the bottom of the confusion. 
￼De facto v. de jure. 
People are confused about 1099 and W-2. The reason is the government has built-in healthcare rules that go against 1099 rules. Ie… ￼ you aren’t supposed to pay for your contractors HIPAA compliant email but you also are not supposed to tell them how to run business. The problem is in order to run the business, they need a HIPAA compliant email. Do you see how the problem is built into the solution 👀👀👀 ￼ how many electricians plumbers and carpenters do you know w a hipaa  compliant email?? 👀👀 working against us. 
It’s purposeful confusion. (Yes. I spent the past week studying the differences) 🔥🔥

STARK based on your post, is not applicable..... this is NOT legal advice. 

However, Mini-Stark laws (self-referral laws) in the state of practice may be applicable.... Seek the advice of a Stark law attorney in the state in which you practice.

It's already mid-week everybody! I hope you are all doing pretty well. I am planning to put up a LLC with the goal of converting it to a cash-based business in the future but for now, I am trying to contract with a home health agency. 

What are the main licenses I should apply for given my current goal? State, local and federal licenses? Do I need health permits/medical licenses before I can start using my business?

Thank you all for sharing your thoughts. I have more in the way as I also read through some online articles.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your business will need to be set up with your secretary of state. Some states (including your state practice board) may have requirements about whether it is an LLC or PLLC. You need to check with that. Then you need to apply for an EIN with the IRS for your business. Now your business is ready to contract with the home health agency. I would also recommend applying for a type 2 NPI for your business as well. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.

Hi! I use Mercer/Proliability for one of my OT small businesses, but I am in the process of setting up a second business with a PT partner. This second business will be only for online educational content (online courses) marketed to the general public (not to other practitioners, or at least not yet). I am really having some struggles with Mercer on getting set up with liability insurance and have been told SO many different things depending on what day I call. Does anyone have a business that has more than 1 business owner, and primarily or only does online courses (not direct therapy services)? It seems weird to pay the same amount that I do for a service-based business when this other business really only needs the educational or non-direct care rider, if that makes sense. Surely someone else out there does this!!! TIA!!

Hello, one of my patients inquired about private treatments from me for his son.  I already have my c-corporation but I am clueless regarding the policies and limitations regarding direct access or private treatments.  I was wondering if any of you had any resources to share regarding this!

I might not be doing the best job of explaining my situation but some of my concerns are:
-What information is required/has to be disclosed in the patient intake forms if I were to do private treatments like this?
-I have professional liability insurance and I am currently contracted (1099) as my primary job. Does that change anything in regard to my c-corporation business?  

Thank you for your time!

I Have general and personal malpractice insurance via CM&F. When you hired a new PT, we’re you guys able to add them to your existing coverage? Or did you have to make an entirely new plan for them?

Hi everyone, I have question regarding commercial, professional and general liability insurance. I do mobile, independent contractor and about to sublease a space inside a doctor’s office. I am in New Jersey. My professional and general liability is under my name instead of my LLC. Is this good or bad? What’s a good coverage and insurance that you use? Do you need a broker to get these insurance?

Hello,

Wondering if you can give me an advice about my situation.

I'm currently in NY, but I'm looking to move out of state by the end of year due to family reasons. I've been asked many times by patients that I discharged in hospital outpt if I offer private PT, cash based, i've said no but now just I started looking into it. I hope it's not yet too late. My plan is just me and no other employees. I already have an EIN from my other side hustles in the past few years. 

There was a family member for one of my former patients said they're not worried about superbills and insurance, so they are willing to pay cash. 

1. Is it necessary to form a PLLC, given that I only have more than 5 more months into this business, or is it okay to be just a sole proprietor?
2. Do I still need to have an NPI type 2. I have a type 1 NPI from my other jobs (ILF. Hospital Outpt) 
3. I have an HPSO liability insurance for my part times and prn jobs, do you any have resources what to look for insurance for my business. 

Thank you very much for all your advice uncaged clinicians!!

Hey all, I have an offer to contract my business with a local business that is becoming a certified rehab agency. We would be using our own EMR and of course liability insurance. They have requested a contract with hourly rates for both PT and PTA. I’m not sure what reimbursement looks like for a 4 unit visit at a certified rehab because we are credentialed with part B, so looking for feedback on what rates you would negotiate for both provider types?

I’m in the process of bringing on my first therapist (in addition to myself). For those of you who have mobile practices- how do you have your therapists transmit intakes and consents for those clients who can’t complete them digitally? Are you using a HIPAA compliant app?

Also I’ve been considering doing away with my one demographic intake form altogether- I already have all the info electronically at the time of referral, but was under the impression having the client fill it out is the HIPAA compliant way to obtain this info. What do other people do?

About to renew my liability insurance and since that last renewal, I now have several W2 employees. My employees are required to carry their own professional liability insurance (which they are reimbursed for). When renewing, do I need to have all my employees under my business' liability insurance, or just me and the business? I'm seeing different quotes and was hoping to get some insight. Thank you!

Anyone use Insureon for more extensive general liability coverage for a mobile practice? I was recommended to look into it by CM&F rep, will just get my professional liability through CM&F since he told me it doesn't cover mobile visits. Do I even need this general liability coverage if I'm mobile and I don't have much of equipment/assets? Also, should I add my business as an interest to my professional liability insurance now that it exists? Thanks in advance!
