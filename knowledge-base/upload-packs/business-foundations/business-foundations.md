13… I have 13 patients scheduled.

It has taken 3 solid years of highs and lows, second guessing myself on this journey, and wondering if I made the right move.  But 3 years and I hit my target goal of 12/week… 12 was my magic number to average 10/week.  12 would let me do what I set out to do from the beginning… “part time hours, full time pay”… 12 meant not needing to rely on prn gigs to get by… 12 meant I made the right choice to step away from a job where I was throwing myself into working for a company heart and soul and being told it was never good enough- see more patients, more productivity, never going to make more than the bottom 25% of the advertised company pay bracket for my position despite doing all the extras and being there for 10 years… 

So today I celebrate 13!  I know it is just 1 week and I hope it is the first of many… I know I will still have highs and lows in this business ownership life… but I encourage you to keep trucking along because there is a better way to provide healthcare, a beautiful collaborative way to connect with other therapists and promote this direction of patient care… we’ve got this!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congratulations 👏👏👏

> **Response 2:** I am loving this!!! 💕

Hi Everyone. A while back I asked for prayers for my 23 weeker twins. Not sure who will see this post, but just wanted to update the group with this recent photo of them. They are hitting most milestones according to their adjusted age and starting to try new foods. One has a pretty strong bottle aversion we are working on and praying for, but otherwise, they are doing well. Tiny miracle babies! Both under 1.5lbs!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** May God continue to bless them abundantly!!! 🙌🙌🙌
So great. Thank you for the update, Lindsay Aberle!

> **Response 2:** Amazing creations ❣️They are beautiful ❣️ Prayers for continued good progress ❣️

How to properly set your “cash” price to reach your practice goals!

This was a comment made on a post that seemed to be helpful to others so I will share in more detail here:

I don’t think it’s helpful to set your price based on competition in the area, I think it makes a lot more sense to set your price based on the goals you have for yourself individually and in the practice. 

So, let’s look at this together:

Step 1: What so you want to bring home per year after taxes? 

In this example I will use $100,000 (that’s take home after taxes, that would be pretty awesome right?! Well, it’s totally possible, let’s keep going…)

Step 2: Figure out how much you would need to bring in TOTAL (gross revenue for the year) using this calculation:

7/10   $100,000/x (picture below)

Example: $142,857

Step 3: Divide by 48 weeks (because you should absolutely be taking 4 weeks off per year as a business owner to make this thing sustainable 👊🏻)

Example= $2,976 per week

Step 4: What is your “sweet spot” for number of visits per week that you could maintain as a solo preneur (for now, until you hire if that’s a goal of yours)

Example= $2976/18 visits per week

= $165/visit

So, that means that you cannot charge anything less than $165 per visit (even with packages) in order to hit your personal goals.

Remember: If your cup is full, then you will be able to overflow into the lives of others and make the impact you are looking for. 

Hope this is helpful for you 👊🏻. 

Keep going. Don’t stop. Embrace the unknown.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I now use 44 weeks per year in my equations.  My awesome boss thought I needed more PTO 🤣

> **Response 2:** The key: 
Don’t set your price based on competition.

A friend posted this today in our Leaders Network & I loved it *

You graduate college with 100k in debt, people clap and cheer for you. 

You get married and spend between 5-50k for one day, people will clap and cheer for you.

You take a 200k loan from the bank to buy your first house, people will clap and cheer for you. 

You take a loan for 30 - 40k for a car (a depreciating asset) with an interest rate, people will clap and cheer for you. 

Thats 500,000 in total debt that MOST people are living in, and somehow they are feeling good about it because people are congratulating them for it. 

—————————————————————

Now, go and tell those same people you spent a few hundred dollars to start your own business......

“Are you sure?” 
“What if it doesn’t work?”
“Can you get your money back?”
“What if people laugh at you?”

Picture a bucket full of crabs with no lid. The moment a crab tries to get out, the other crabs will literally rip its legs off to keep it in the bucket with them. 

This year, pay attention to who you’re surrounding yourself with and who’s speaking into your life. 

To my fellow entrepreneurs, STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT OTHERS THINK AND KEEP PROMOTING YOUR BUSINESS. You got this 🙌🏽💅🏽💪🏽✨

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Love this. We all need to hear this!!! It can be so hard sometimes and easy to doubt yourself. Thank you Fitzherbert Harry

For those charging over $200, do you have like, a special niche or group that you market to or would you say you do traditional PT? I'm just starting and I'm having trouble even saying I charge $175 for an eval, much less get people to sign up. I don't want to undersell myself, and I've heard starting low and going up isn't a good idea, but I need to start getting patients....any amount of money would be nice at this point....

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My husband put it a good way- you can see 10 patients for $50 each or 5 patients for $100 each (just an example, not actual pricing). So sometimes it’s more worth it to sell to/book one client vs 2-3 at a lower price. I looked at what people in my area are charging for similar services and what my goal income per month would be with how many hours I’m willing to work. That gave me a number I was happy about!

Excited for you!!!! 😀😀😀

> **Response 2:** VALUE >>PRICE ....   I'd figure out what I was selling first (hint: they can get the result/outcome anywhere... ).  godspeed

A little pat on my own back: As of June 1, I will have had my brick and mortar wellness studio open for 1.5 yrs. It's just me in there about 99% of the time.

Last year, I averaged 36 visits/month.  This year (not counting this month) I've averaged 55 visits/month.  All time, I've averaged 41 visits/month.

This month SO FAR I have 92 visits scheduled!!

(Now I just need to figure out how to price myself so that my bank account reflects my busy schedule.....)

**Original Post:**
Getting the practice going has been extremely stressful, but I just got one hell of a motivator from my first reimbursement from BCBS-UT. They paid me $241 for 1 eval of 5 units, 1 untimed eval code + 4 timed codes of about 10 min each. They are one of the highest payors in UT so I understand all insurances won’t be like that and evals pay a lot more, but even at the SNF I only make $47/hr or $35/hr OP Ortho PP. Even after taxes, overhead costs, and paying out 6% to a billing company that is substantially more per hour, and I get to treat in the setting I want to be in with the types of patients I want to treat. I’m also going to be pushing the cash pay side hard as well which doesn’t require me to pay out to a billing company so my per hour reimbursement will be higher there. 

If I needed a sign that I’m making the right decision to go out on my own I just got one. That got me fired up! 🔥

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Brian Collins, how do you learn which insurance companies use CMS 8 minute rule vs. SPM rule of 8's?  I've spent hours on BCBS & CIGNAs website trying to find out their policy.

> **Response 2:** That’s awesome but just for everyone to be aware that Blue Cross Blue Shield has different reimbursement rates in the different states. For us Blue Cross Blue Shield has awesome reimbursement rates in one state we are in and horrible in the next.￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For the record, I asked him how they were handling second-story windows. He said they invested in equipment with long extension handle, so they did not have to climb on any ladders.  And yes yes …. ￼ I saw him for physical therapy today at 5 PM. He was not getting out of that.

Why’s it so hard to get a signed POC returned?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The better question - why do we NEED a signature on any POC? The physicians DO NOT care. Why is this still a thing?

> **Response 2:** We hired a stay at home mom whose whole job is to track and get POCs signed.  She gets paid $150 a week and can work whenever fits her schedule.  Some weeks she does a bunch some she doesn’t have much to do.  She loves it as some extra easy steady income to cover some groceries and it stops making us want to pull our hair out.

I put in my notice today to go PRN at my current company!! Also planning to go PRN with two other agencies just to have flexibility and ensure that I can stay as full as I want/need, but I’m so thrilled that this gives me the freedom I need to ramp up my own new business! I have three patients ready to start in January, and now I’ll have even more time for marketing and networking! I’ve never worked anything other than full-time for someone else, so this will be a big adjustment for me, but I’m so excited to make this change! 🥳

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You’ve got this.  There are new and different stressors about being your own boss.  But I could never imagine going back to work for somebody else.  It’s totally worth it!

> **Response 2:** Way to go! Great decision. Going PRN is a nice way to transition before cutting the cord from the JOB.

What do other Luna clinicians think of the new $7.50 fee per visit they are instituting?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have reached out for more information: how this is communicated with the patient, is it traditional medicare only or med adv plans as well, why is it a per visit fee vs just a one time fee which would be much more reasonable.

> **Response 2:** One of my Medicare patients through Luna already asked me if that’s illegal because she’s not supposed to pay anything with Medicare. 
Another person dropped his sessions. Said he’s not paying for it when he can’t even get timely helped with Concierge and doesn’t have the app because he’s just not into using his phone that much. 
All fair points by them.

**Community Responses:**

Man, I hope this ends up being a trend, but people seem to be quite alright with doing my 1-on-1 private pay $170 per 1-hr eval and $130 or less for 45-min follow-up sessions depending on whether they got a package after the evaluation. Another couple new private pay evals lined up, one being a referral from the physiatrist. Evidently if you give people great care some don’t care what you charge and are willing to pay for it. 

I know this is less than many of y’all charge, but in my area people are charging $115-175/hr for evals so me being at $170 already places me at the top vs in the middle of the area market when I was located much farther away from home. 

🤞 This WOM fire keeps spreading! Also I got one lead from auto-scheduler from my website that converted recently as well which was exciting. 

It’s been a slow build up process, but I think I can finally see the light. I‘m glad because rent is going to be much more burdensome soon enough.

**Community Responses:**

Subject:  Black Friday and Cyber Monday

Hey, All!  As someone opening my own mobile practice and knowing that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are coming up soon, I want to keep my eye out for good deals.  

For example, for me, I need either a laptop or tablet and exercise equipment and I'm hoping subscription service companies like Ring Central will be offering promotions.

What great practice related items or services have you purchased/received in the past and or you will be looking out for on these days?  Any hot tips to save some cool cash? 😁

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Also, on the marketing side, Vistaprint has sales all the time but they're Black Friday is usually really great if you need business cards, etc.

> **Response 2:** I bought adjustable dumbbells & kettlebells, and a number of medicine balls/slam balls at this time last year

This is for all the newbies who are struggling/doubting themselves.

Valuable lesson learned from flag football:
My 9yo is on a flag football team, and he's the youngest and the smallest kid on the team.  He's also one of the fastest and has a ridiculously good throwing arm with great accuracy.  Unfortunately, his coaches won't give him a chance at QB because of his size, and the kid they play at QB isn't accurate enough to throw long passes.  Last game, I watched my son start to give up.  He was sitting on the sideline with tears in his eyes, trying not to cry and visibly sinking in to sadness.  He was avoiding looking at me so that he didn't melt completely in to tears, but at one point he glanced at me and I mouthed "it's ok" and pointed at my heart and back at him.  His coach I think noticed his change in temperment, too, and a few minutes later he was put in on defense.  I can only assume that he was told to rush the quarterback, because as soon as the ball was snapped my son forced him back 10 yards.  The next play, he did it again.  And his entire body changed after that.  He held his head up, he smiled, he started enjoying it again.
After the game, I pulled him aside and said "listen to me.  There are going to be times that you don't get the shot you think you deserve.  And in those times, you'll have 2 choices.  You can give up and stop trying, and that's ok.  You can make that choice.  But if you do that, no one will ever give you that chance again.  Or, you can choose to go back out and prove to the doubters why they should've believed in you in the first place.  And that's what you did today.  You made them see why they have to give you a chance.  Because you're worth it."
Today has been discouraging, and frustrating, and a little teary on my end.  But I've replayed that conversation in my head a few times, and decided to listen to myself.
It's SUPER hard to start a small business, especially when you're competing with 100 other options.  But it's our job to bounce back and prove why we can't be ignored.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have so much to learn from our kids and how we choose to guide them through life. Just know you're being an amazing example in every way, especially having the courage to start and flourish in your own business. I have a 4 and 6 year old and started 2 years ago

> **Response 2:** Love that! Also, remind the coach that Stetson Bennett didn’t get a chance to play QB either, and then won Back 2 Back Natties!

I feel bad even asking this but I cannot find any posts that simply just came out and asked…

How much do you earn doing this: 

1. As a side hustle

2. Full time 

Feel free to message me privately if you don’t want to post that on here but I would truly appreciate actually seeing some numbers. It’s just tough bc I make 120k a year as a director for several out patient/ personal injury clinics (a very easy/stress free job) and have had colleagues tell me I’d be insane to leave and open my own cash based mobile clinic. 

I feel like I’d be successful but I don’t have an idea of what “successful” even looks like in terms of money.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 2020 was my first year full time in business.  I’ve brought in $100-120k revenue each year.  

I could have brought in more than 120k in 2022 if I wanted to prioritize it, but I did a lot of non-work things instead…..

What being self-employed allowed me to do in 2022:  
I decided to stop focusing on the business and rather focus on my mental and physical health.
I paid myself as an employee 65k.  

I camped and hiked 1-2 times a month April-Oct.
I improved my hiking ability from 5 miles to 22 miles — hiked Mt Whitney last September! I also hiked the tallest mountains in NC & VA.

Spent 2 weeks in Mexico.  1 week in California.  A week in the mountains with my sister and nephews.

I took up Olympic Weightlifting 8 hours/week.  Learned some Spanish.  Took a mentorship course and several other PT courses.  

I did a landscaping project and other home projects — paid for by the business (I work out of my home).

I did a lot of bodywork and psychotherapy.  

I did almost no marketing and stayed busy with word of mouth.  I saw 16-20 clients a week @ $149.

This year, 2023, raised my rates to $170 so I can max out my week at 18 clients.
My goal is to be an intermediate Spanish speaker by the end of the year.  Continue with Olympic weightlifting, get back into Pole dancing, and learn about rappelling/Canyoneering to prepare for 3 weeks in the Azores this fall.

> **Response 2:** Success to me is owning my own time. ￼ Do I make a little bit more than working for an employer? Yes. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. ￼ I don’t have to ask anyone permission for ￼ anything

question
What do you guys do when an obviously rich patient is asking for a 50$ discount on your cash prices. I work in NYC and I think I charge pretty low (150$) and they want aquatic therapy with the pool in their temporary building which frankly I’d charge 180$ for. I don’t take their insurance. I’m not sure how to put my foot down about prices or try to come to a compromise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You respectfully tell them, "I dedicate a lot of time, effort, and resources to provide premium PT experience."  If they still want the the discount  tell them to kick rocks.

> **Response 2:** That’s one of the reasons they are rich. Never be ashamed to ask for a deal as a consumer. However, always be ready to politely explain why you don’t offer deals.

Was just scrolling and came across this. She charges 165 as a nail tech… meanwhile PTs struggle to do the same… CHARGE YOUR WORTH!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love posts like these. It truly shifts perspectives. There is a buyer at every price point for every market. 

There are people who value this as a service at this price point while others don’t.

This isn’t a comparison of industries as much as its conviction to charge higher, belief in value provided, and selling to the right market that values it at that price point. 

We often can’t sell at higher rates because we’re judging someone else’s pockets as if it’s our own, or trying to sell to someone who doesn’t value the service already. 

I’m glad this was shared in here. Always shows what is possible if we’re willing to see it.

In Sarasota off Honore. If anyone knows of anyone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pay more. It’s simple. If you pay more and offer good benefits and actual work/life balance, they will come. Therapists are leaving the field in masses because they can’t pay their massive loans, have to treat multiple patients at one time and have no work/life balance. Create a good environment for them, be VERY clear and transparent in your posting. Don’t play games with recruiters, salaries, make it an easy choice for them.

**Original Post:**
I’ve been a cash based therapist and personal trainer for a year now working out of my home studio. 

I’m still really struggling with my fees. My therapy clients are my easiest. I see them, they leave, and I’m done. My personal training clients require significant more work. I see them, they leave, then I’m busy making exercise programs for them, finding an inspiring podcast or article for them to read, analyzing their nutrition logs for them, etc. 

It seems as if I should be charging more for using the skills of my therapy/masters degree, however so much more work is involved with my personal training clients. 

1/2 my clients get a combo of both services. So how would you break down fees for services? Just have a flat fee for all my services regardless of what they are receiving?

My other problem is 50-75% of people that email me inquiring my service rates don’t respond after I tell them. In comparison to all the other local gyms (I did my research) I’m on the lower side. 

Thoughts? 
(Latest social media post photo for the hell of it.)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same rate you offer your rehab patients. You are practicing at your highest degree and your admin time should be considered.

> **Response 2:** Personally I’d charge a higher price point because although I may wear  many hats, what’s underneath the hat is always the same.  You’re always going to be thinking at your highest skill level and you’re a good PT who cares about motivating your clients, know your value. The clients who pay for having a good PT who also trains (because it’s not as common as you may think) are the ones you want to keep anyway. 

Charge more so you can provide a better product and ultimately work less

Cash-based pt 1st visit: Family wants the pt to walk. Pt is hoyer lift, confused, uncooperative. Family thinks the rate should be 25% less because of how much the other PT is charging. (Hired to be supplemental, since pt receives 3x/wk, wants another 2 days that the other PT cannot fulfill. Dilemma on whether to continue seeing the pt or any suggestions? Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They are choosing - CHOOSING - to have extra care.  They don’t get to choose the price; particularly just because they are already paying someone else.  

If I go to the movies after dinner, I don’t get to ask for a discount on the popcorn because I’ve already eaten

> **Response 2:** I would tell them I’m not able to help said patient achieve the goal of walking per her present barriers/condition and would not be comfortable taking their money for that. Then I would move on and let the cheap PT deal with it. This has cray cray family in denial of reality written all over. ..definitely not worth it

I want to give a testimonial to Kevin DeGroot, Josh Payne, David Bayliff, and all the staff at UNCAGED CLINICIAN. My partner and I left our full time jobs at the end of September 2023 and were very nervous about how long it would take us to replace our salaries again with starting from zero. Because of the guidance, consistent meetings, frequent check-ins, and camaraderie facilitated amongst other practitioners by Uncaged Clinician; my partner and I were able to pay ourselves back any loans we gave the business and replace our pay checks just 5 months into business! Let me stress, we had to fill TWO schedules, so we knew it would take us longer to reach fully booked status as compared to solo entrepreneurs. We are highly impressed that with the training we received, and A LOT of elbow grease, we have had raving success that we feel is set up to last for a long time. If you are considering becoming uncaged and don't know where to start, or are nervous to take the leap, sign up for a discovery call with these guys! They are all about personal development and community building along side the business education.

I am contemplating adding a subscription type service for PT.  A monthly fee.  I am wondering if anyone here had successfully done something like this?  

I starting completely mobile, but am now hybrid.  I want to grow my in person/clinic visits and hoping to add some value by doing this.  

Any insight from someone who has done thus would be appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The concept works. It makes it easier from a billing standpoint. Allows for less administrative work. 

Your best bet is to limit how many visits per month. Plus you need a certain number of people ready to sign up. 

Say you only have 15 people the first 6 months that have subscriptions. If you're charging $200 to $250 per month, you're only bringing in $3000 to $3750. It would seem like charging more would be the thing, but people are already paying monthly for health insurance. If you're in a more affluent location, this may be fine. So location/population are key factors. Also having enough people that want to sign up for it. 

Subscription models for PT aren't common and it may take more convincing for others to join.

Pairing up with organizations/clinics that do concierge model of Healthcare is important.

I don't have all the answers to this model. I've been trying it out for a while. It has its plus and minuses.

> **Response 2:** I'd be interested if anybody does this monthly subscription model for PT in states like California where you'd have to get the POC signed within 30 days or X # visits.

The first photo came up in my memories today. It was my first “office” 10 years ago.

It was a 6x10 walk in closet in a chiropractor’s office that I turned into a cozy therapy room.  My table was on furniture sliders it was so small.  Don’t ever let someone tell you a space is too small to launch your dream.  

The remaining photos are of my treatment room inside the wellness center I own today. 

The initial growth my business experienced came through inspiration but this past year it came through “growing pains” instead. 

The memory of my first office popping up today reminded me of the sensation and feeling of inspiration I had for the first 10 years in business. It made me realize that over the past year I’ve been functioning in a mode of fear/lack. Finally recognizing this, I was able to transition back into inspiration and wonderment.  Such a sign of relief!🥰

I hope you all find some inspiration or wonderment in your businesses today as well!! 💕💕

Do you know when everything changed for me in business?

When I stopped reading everything and looking for the secret sauce.

I read over 110 business books when I first started my practice in 2016…

I still made tons of mistakes and had to learn on the fly.

And the most eye-opening part?

I’ve re-read many of those books and ONLY about FIVE of them are actually worth keeping and implementing.

We live in a world where information is almost too abundant. Stop information gathering, and start implementing 👊. You will be thankful you did. 😃

**Community Responses:**

Get comfortable talking about pay. I was at a dry needling course this weekend and met multple cash PTs. It was interesting hearing the spectrum of what others were charging for regular visits . Per visit some charged 110, some 225 and one guy charges 400 per visit for his Utah practice . I have never heard of a therapist charging 400 per visit. He said sells packages of 6 visits so about $2400. It is good for me to hear those numbers to hear what is possible.

**Community Responses:**

Wondering if any of you pay your employees per patient that they see rather than per hour? We do charge a no-show or cancellation fee, but I have had quite a few lately and I don't feel like my PT's who are in the office are incentivized enough to maybe contact somebody on the waiting list when they rather just sit around. This is something I have discussed with them already but wondering if a flat rate per patient that is higher than what they get paid per hour would incentivize them more to keep their schedule full. Just wanted to get your thoughts

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ARE they literally sitting around? When do they finish extra paperwork, contact physicians, consult with coworkers on challenging cases, review continuing education, prepare in advance for the rest of the day/week? All of this is work.

> **Response 2:** Your job to fill the schedule not the clinicians

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t understand the question. 

Are you asking if you should charge $500-$700 a visit for PT? If so then heck yes! 

Are you asking if you should pay $500 to $700 a visit for PT? If so then Heck no! You already paid $100k+ in education. Just do it yourself🤣

> **Response 2:** Impossible to narrow down to a range because it’s subjective. I think buying a new sports car is a rip off cuz I don’t care about cars at all….but other people find that a great use of their money. 

Don’t put yourselves in other people’s wallets. You just tell them the benefits of working with you, and if you position it well and they see the benefit, they will pay whatever you’re charging.

But I also wouldn't have gotten on it in the first place without knowing I'd have support to get through the lows. The coaching from Kevin DeGroot , Josh Payne and David Bayliff in their Pathway program does exactly that. (And it helps make those peaks and valleys not quite so extreme.)

OK, are you brainiacs out there? Figure this one out

Wednesday  afternoon

slipped on let’s just say a banana peel not sure what it was. I did not fall. I did not have any impact. I caught myself and my final position of my leg when I caught myself was foot flat,  knee to about 50 degrees , flexion internal rotation of the hip and adduction of the hip 

For several days, I’ve had super patella swelling , some point tenderness around the fibular head and on the femorsl condyle  anterio-lateral. 

This morning I wake up with bruising on my fibular head , on the lateral tibia proximal  right next to the fibrillar head and on the femoral condo, not on the patella  and a smaller lighter bruise on the medial tibia condyle

I’ve had difficulty with weight-bearing until it gets warmed up and then I have no problem with flexion extension weight-bearing just pivoting. I have no trouble at all doing quad sets since the beginning!

Can go up on left tiptoes no problem

This swelling in half what it was

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No pain ascending stairs

Descending discomfort at full flexion..likely swelling

> **Response 2:** I am now 48 hours past injury and the only symptom I’m having is discomfort in the femoral head 
where the bruise is so I’m beginning to think that I have a tear in ant-superior 
Tibiofibular ligament which interestingly enough is where the most bruising is even though it’s already discolored and Brown, after only 40 hours

Still some supra patellar swelling, but it’s going down significantly every day and quad contraction of any kind doesn’t set off any symptom

This question comes up often here. Our health insurance is going up again this year and we pay for everything anyway bc of a high deductible. Who has switched to Healthshare and can share their experience positive and negative. I am about to make the jump but want to hear from some people who have switched. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Zion healthshare and absolutely love it. Their customer service is amazing. I am actually dealing with a whole cancer situation that required genetic testing (that they normally wouldn’t cover but did), and will be having surgery in a few weeks—once i paid my $1000 deductible every single thing has been covered and I don’t have to pay out of pocket, they send me a virtual credit card. 

The process of saying you’re self pay and getting itemized receipts takes a second to get used to but I haven’t had any issues getting reimbursed or challenges getting care.

> **Response 2:** Ok now I’d like to know, do these health share companies cover prosthetics? My prosthetuc leg was $89,000. It’s out of warranty and broke.  I got a charitable organization to pay the $12,000 repair bill, but I’ll eventually need a new one and could really use a new socket (about $10k for that).

Hello, everyone! 
Looking for help! 

DPT and first time mom here! I’m in the middle of my maternity leave and the idea of having to go back to work and leave my baby girl is daunting! I’ve always toyed with the idea of starting a mobile cash-based practice but chicken out everytime! I took a Herman & Wallace Pelvic Health course last summer and never got to use anything I learned. I’m seriously considering attempting to get something mobile started now and would like my focus to be on pregnant and postpartum mothers. I haven’t taken any classes on pregnancy but would love to. I’m not able to do this fill time but could start slow and see where it takes me. What is the reality that something like this could work? Mobile cash-based pregnant/postpartum patients. Any insight is more than welcome. Can anyone weigh in on this? I’m so over working for other people and would love to give my girl all of the attention she needs! Thank you!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d say this is definitely doable but don’t just fall for the fantasy of how great it sounds. It CAN be, but after a lot of work, even if you plan to start slowly. There will be a lot of work to go into starting a business you won’t know about til you start, even slow/part time. I did this coming back from my first mat leave and I have no regrets, but wish someone painted a realistic picture for me. It was way more work and is now the flexible venture I wanted. The end goal of working part time and being with my kiddo was possible, but the work to get it going wasn’t as simple or “part time” as I thought. I would much rather work hard for myself than someone else, but just want you to have a realistic view of what it entails. 

I also think you’ll need to take more coursework to adequately treat this population as a solo provider without mentorship. 

I’d also recommend the Business Accelerator course through Pelvic PT Rising. It’s an investment that will save you a lot of headaches and mistakes as you launch!

> **Response 2:** Definitely doable but don’t get confused, it’s not “less work” or less time.

Don't know who needs to hear this but as a reminder, your business should work for you not the other way around. 

We use the wrong metrics to determine whether we're  successful. revenue each month, new clients, profit, etc. 

These are all focused on the business as the primary focus for growth and success as opposed to the business owner and members of the organization as the primary focus. 

I believe that most KPIs are helpful and obviously you need to have an understanding of them to know if your business is actually sustainable financially but if we're stopping here we fail to recognize what matters the most. 

Let's see some focus on KPIs of personal growth, health, lack of anxiety, peace of mind, and general joy and fulfillment in our businesses.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So true Kevin! Since starting my own business this year I have been able to focus on my own health and stress levels. I have dropped 35# so far and my goal for the calendar year is 50#. Plan on crushing that! Hitting my Kory Personal Indicators- the new KPI 😄

> **Response 2:** So much yes to this!!!! Here are some great changes I have seen in myself since becoming uncaged ( well even before being fully uncaged but starting the process) 
1.  Feeling fire again to learn and be the best PT I can be. 
2. Better sleep 
3. More energy 
4. Improved time allowing for self care which has resulted in 26lbs of weight loss 
5. Boosted self confidence 
6. Allowing myself the opportunity/giving myself permission to dream again… and then go for it. 

So many great things!

What are people using for HIPAA compliant phone/texting systems?
We currently are using Google voice, but definitely are growing out of it and need a more comprehensive and better system. I did a demo with a company called Quo (formerly called open phone) and I was really impressed with them. Loved their features and everything really seemed great, but then when I started doing some digging and reading reviews, there were too many recent ones that were poor and has made me want to reconsider. 

We have four people that all need to access the phone and we need to keep texts and voice messages organized so things are not getting dropped.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting, I actually started with Iplum and had a hard time with it. I found a call quality to be poor when I was out and about, and the whole phone tree set up was so confusing . I had a hard time reaching anybody from Customer Service. That was like five years ago though so maybe they have improved ￼

> **Response 2:** Update: currently transitioning to quo…. I’ll keep you posted how it goes!

I had someone want to pay for wellness services with a HSA debit card.  I told her, um, I don't think you can use that for what you are doing with me.  She said she uses it for everything, massages, this/that (other things that I think sound questionable) and she has never had a problem with it.
I was in a hard spot because I hadn't told her before the visit that I take cash/check only.  I'm not set up for credit card payments, but I know I need to be.  So I took the card number with the intent of getting set up with Square or Stripe and then charging it.

BUT, if I charge her card, and they audit and deem it an inappropriate charge - will that come back on me?   Or will it go back on her for using it for a non-covered expense? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes !!!!!

> **Response 2:** If you are set up as a medical provider, she can use her HSA card.

> **Response 2:** Our clinic has been providing what I call an MMM for over 20 years.

MMM stands for monthly maintenance membership, and our MMM is called the Diamond Club ￼

In our case, it’s structured as a discount benefit to maintain their state of wellness after they’ve completed active care.

￼we used to also have a premium membership.

￼
Ive taught the membership concept to other practice owners and happy to share if there’s enough people to do a quick zoom training ￼💎

Hey! 

Based on some convos I've had with people in this group, I put together a beginner's guide on putting together an email list

Considering the return on investment of an email list is an upwards of 4400%, I think its a great thing to get started on!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks!

> **Response 2:** Something I’ve done is create pdfs of specific info (postpartum return to exercise, csection scar care, etc) and place a flyer with QR codes in doctor offices, gyms, coffee shops, etc. The QR code takes them to a landing page (I use mailchimp also) they can enter their name and email and then the requested material is automatically emailed to them. To get the automatic function you do have to pay the lowest fee of $13/mo but I think it’s worth it!

🗣️A MESSAGE‼️

A violinist played for 45 minutes in the New York subway.  A handful of people stopped, a couple clapped, and the violinist raised about $30 in tips. 

No one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the best musicians in the world. In that subway, Joshua played one of the most intricate pieces ever written with a violin worth 3.5 million dollars.

Two days before he played in the subway, Joshua Bell sold out a Boston theatre, and the seats averaged about $100. 

The experiment proved that the extraordinary in an ordinary environment does not shine and is so often overlooked and undervalued.

There are brilliantly talented people everywhere who aren’t receiving the recognition and reward they deserve. But once they arm themselves with value and confidence and remove themselves from an environment that isn’t serving them, they thrive and grow. 

Your gut is telling you something. Listen to it if it’s telling you where you are isn’t enough! 

Go where you are appreciated and valued. 

Know Your Worth.

OK. I come here as a scared and nervous dog with my tail between my legs. I know I keep getting told to build relations to get my side hustle, cash practice moving. But HOW?!? 
I have been a "loner" my whole life and am so incredibly introverted. Like to the point a cabin in the woods is my dream. 
I am still trying to work the boots on the ground approach, and literally my anxiety gets so high I feel nauseous. I start shaking. It becomes hard to unbuckle my seat belt. I don't go places regularly and don't have many friends. So my connections are minimal at best. 
How does one get past this phobia of talking to people? How do I start to put myself out there? How do I start to build relations with businesses and others to get referrals? 
Thanks for any input.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This has been hard for me too! Although I am not an introvert, but I think there is some level of anxiety for everyone! Something that helped me is reaching out to local business email or social media. Then that gives me a foot in the door and I just say "hi I'm a local business new to the area (*describe a little about yourself/business*, I love how your business does *xyz* and I can really see how we could be a great referral source for each other. Would you have any time to meet in the next 2-3 weeks for me to take you out for coffee and hear more about you and your business?" It works pretty well for me, most people either respond... or ignore me lol No one has ever been nasty... and I live in Jersey lol It gets easier with practice 🙂 you got this!

> **Response 2:** Start by committing to get there and take the seatbelt off.  Make that commitment.  Get dressed, drive there, and take you seatbelt off.  once you find yourself there it will be easier to talk yourself into the rest.  mini steps that put you in a position where it's ia almost silly to stop there.

Explain to me like I’m a PT toddler…in a Cash Based Wellness setting can Medicare patients cash pay? How do I document  to reflect Wellness only?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I feel like everyone is over complicating this. The OP said cash based welless practice....

It depends on what services you are offering this person in your "cash based wellness setting". If it is truly a service like personal training or fitness related and doesn't fall under physical therapy, then absolutely you can accept cash. 

Now you can't just rename it wellness if it truly is a physical therapy service, that requires the care of a physical therapist and you are treating a specific diagnosis.

But if they're seeing you just simply to get stronger, get in better shape, lose weight, etc and it doesn't fall under physical therapy, you can charge cash.

I hope that helps a bit!

> **Response 2:** “Patient is able to perform independent ADLs and self care, but is seeking additional interventions to improve tolerance and skill for recreational activities” 

Can really write whatever you want. Have a justifiable reason and get an ABN and you’re fine. Medicare is not going to come after you for saving them money, you’re just justifying receiving cash in case a patient tries to get reimbursed on the back end later. If you make sure they know it’s not covered you are unlikely to ever have an issue.

seeking legal consult in setting up my new business. I was quoted $1500 for: filing fees for LLC, articles of formation, operating agreement, unanimous written consent in lieu of an organizational meeting, and an application for tax id #. Their typical fee for a PA trademark application is an additional $350. I obviously want to establish a good relationship, but it seems like I can do most, if not all, of what the $1500 covers. I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks, in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can go onto the Secretary of State website and do it yourself for a WHOLLLE lot less than $1500

Next week I start one day a week working on my own practice! I have a space, an LLC, a name, a treatment table, and a disdain for insurance billing. I have never done it on my own, but know I don't really want to. 
- I will likely have to contract with Medicare because my ideal population is Geriatric. Otherwise, I live in a pretty rural area with significant low-income population. 
- What I am wondering, or hoping I guess, is that some others who are practicing cash based in rural, low- income areas may be able to offer advice or ease of my concerns about charging enough to make this all worth it and not scaring away patients d/t cost.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Out of curiosity, what does it mean to be “in contract” with Medicare? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of being cash-based? Sorry, i’m a new grad so this is all new to me.

> **Response 2:** I am working one day/week in a small rural town. I am finding it very difficult to drum up the business I would like. I think I can break into some community education and make a couple bucks that way, and possibly pick up some clients too; but cash pay is extremely new to people here and they believe in their insurance. Tough to break through that facade and clue them in to the benefits both physically and financially of cash-pay healthcare.

Not having the bad doesn't make you good... 

I've had several times over the past couple weeks where I've been on calls with people interested in starting a business and they say something to the effect of, "I just want to get away from the crappy way healthcare is run." 

I get it. I've been there and have had some really bad experiences in healthcare and in jobs in the past. 

But just moving away from the bad and not being like them only goes so far. 

Each time I've asked, "what do you want your business to look like, what's the GOOD you're going to bring?" and each time the person couldn't answer it. 

Absolutely move away from the bad in healthcare but don't start there. Fill your business with things that are inspiring, hope providing, excellent, client focused, etc.

**Community Responses:**

Revitalizing healthCARE is more than NOT being what everybody else is 💪

What HEP apps is everyone using?  I want something that will do RTM.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use switchback health app. Been loving it so far and was built by a PT for PTs.

> **Response 2:** I think truecoach does this where you can have a dialogue with patients directly through the app. In theory this is great but it isn't cheap. Medbridge allows for patients to check in but not sure if it allows for dialogue. Also medbridge makes it really difficult and not pretty to make workout splits, ie different exercise on M/W/F while true coach allows that pretty easily. 

Because of this, I just use google sheets with commenting turned on. If i had more cash pay patients, I'd probably use true coach .

Hello 🙂 

I put together a checklist of things that I would consider paramount to include in any rehab, wellness or recovery plan 

1. Are you hitting the physical activity guidelines (2+ days per week of muscle strengthening activity and 75-150per week of vigorous aerobic activity)
2. Are you sleeping 7-9 hours a night?
3. Are you hitting your recommended protein target (1.6g/kg body weight)? 
4. Are you hitting your daily fiber goal (25-30g)
5. Are you getting >5 servings fruit and veg per day?

I see a lot of talks in here about what to charge for dry needling only sessions, how much a red light therapy coffin costs or what frequency vibrations should be in the vibration stimulation room. Are these the most health promoting things we can be spending time and money on? 

If your patients don’t hit these markers, is there a push by you to achieve them? If not, why? 

Finally, are you hitting these markers yourself?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BAM 💥 
Let’s talk about the factors causing the problems 💪👊💥

I know that I started an innovative business because of my ADHD, but it’s also not where it could be if I could focus and pay attention to more detailed and boring tasks.

**Original Post:**
I currently have a cash-based mobile PT side hustle that I plan on doing full time soon. I was approached by a local PT who has a booming business (>6 month wait list) to work in her office (still be my own biz owner). She mentioned taking 20% of each visit for my patients and 50% of each visit when I see her patients. My patients are defined as anyone I bring in (for example, if I treat one of my mobile patients in the office) and her patients are anyone who calls to see her (so if someone calls to see her and learns of the 6 month wait list and doesn't want to wait, she'll direct them to me). 50% seems really high to me so I'm curious to get other's opinion's on this! For context, she has a great reputation, >20 years experience, has mentioned she'd be willing to teach me in some specialized areas and otherwise is very flexible with no min number of days/hours required and I would still work for myself. That being said, it's still 50% for a finders fee and I would be doing all of the work with the patient. Since I'm just going from side hustle to full time, I am a bit nervous about building up a case load and this would be one way that could majorly help with that. Does anyone else practice in a similar model? What % split seems fair and reasonable given this situation? I'd love to hear all thoughts an opinions! Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When you hire someone you plan to pay them 30-50% of the revenue they bring in. It sounds like she’s looking at it like you’re an employee

> **Response 2:** I can understand why this may sound as if the price is skewed to her benefit, but IT SHOULD BE! I won't advise on numbers or percentages but will offer you the view from the other side of the coin. When you are just starting out as your own business, it may seem as if the therapist is doing all the work(providing care to the pt and completing the documentation) and yes this is the revenue for the business. However, you need to realize how much goes into the greater picture of running a business than just treating patients and as many people in this group are just starting out, the full picture isn't visible yet(it wasn't for me until this year as I decide to grow my business with additional team members, services, products). As she is a business owner of a brick and mortar clinic, >20 years of experience, high reputation and an impressive 6 month waiting list, she has done EVERYTHING!  She has put in her time, effort, risk, sleepless nights, 60-80 hr work weeks, covering any shift a staff can't, learning HR/bookkeeping/accounting/compliance/risk mngmt/leadership and the cost/time each entails, mistakes in hiring/pricing/policies/EMRs/risk mngmt/scheduling, overcoming and improving on her processes to avoid those same mistakes in the future, cost of property, marketing and advertising,  paying staff instead of herself probably during slow times and so MUCH more!!!  She is also taking a risk on bringing any practitioner or employee into a business she has built for 20 yrs. Her profit margin is not 50% if she pays you 50%. If the business runs on a 5-10% profit margin and she pays a % higher to her team, that's a significant loss in the margin, so as the CEO, that comes out of her CEO salary so to speak. The COST of Attraction, Aquisition and Retention has been Tens of thousands each year for 20 years in addition to overhead costs of admin, environment, etc. We, as a profession, are kind, good-willed humans, and we can be that while being a business owner also, which includes setting your boundaries on what it is worth to the owner to continue running the business. Referring patients out would be giving away her very hard earned Attraction and Aquisition potential to only to give it to someone else for their profit. There is a great likelihood that referring them to someone like a new Uncaged clinician, she will not get them back because that Uncaged member is going to do everything in their power to retain that client, right?  So then she would have worked for years on Attraction and Aquistion(the most costly for the owner) only to give the source of revenue to someone else. That first phone call can make or break a client, so that's the most important call, that's when you get the commitment from the client. For the same reason becoming Uncaged is risky, is the very reason she must work her numbers wisely. Imagine working diligently to get your schedule up to your first 10 clients, your max,  and having to give them to someone else for no return on investment to you. She has INVESTED 20 years of building trust and respect of the community!  Huge accomplishment! Congratulations to her!  Now you just have to decide if you want to be part of what she has already built or if you are ready/willing/capable of doing the same.   Either way, choose what is right for you. Respect the process. Even if you were to work with her and didn't appreciate the numbers, you may be able to learn lots just being involved in her system with your new frame of mind as a new business owner. The whole point, there's another side to the coin. Thanks for letting me share. Good luck no matter what you decide!

Hi everyone, 
I'm an OT who is planning on doing cash pay only on the side. Couple questions.
-Am I good to call it wellness services and see patients without a referral? 
-Am I in violation of any laws by doing so?
-OT is not direct access but does that matter if I'm not providing OT but am instead providing wellness?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What kind of services are you going to provide?

> **Response 2:** Do yourself a favor and review your practice act and ch 15 of Medicare benefits manual, so you have a clear understanding of the rules. You cannot have Medicare patients private pay for services that that would be considered skilled and medically necessary.  There are also the maintenance therapy rules which again, need to be skilled and medically necessary, but generally is not on a consistent basis unless you have a complex case and can justify the ongoing need for skilled care. Self pay for Medicare patients would be only for services not covered by Medicare.

Help! I am starting a mobile side business in CA. I just opened an S-Corp as we can’t do an LLC here. When meeting with my accountant for personal taxes he told me it was crazy to open an S-Corp prior to having 60/80 K in profit and I should just be a sole proprietor. He recommends that I un-incorporate as s-corps are extra steps and expensive in CA. I did the s-corp so my personal assets are protected but he insisted that a good insurance would cover that. This is against any and all recommendations that I have received. Any thoughts/recs??? I am so irritated about the prospect of starting the process over as I am just about ready to start accepting clients! Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Regardless of what your CPA says, you as a PT can establish ONLY an S-Corp in CA. The CPA may not be aware of that

> **Response 2:** I actually don't think any of the below answers are correct. You don't HAVE to be an s-corp because s-corp is a tax designation entity. It has nothing to do with the structure of your business. Physical Therapy practices cannot be LLCs in California but individuals can elect to be either a sole proprietor or professional corporation. All professional corporations in California are registered as c-corps initially but can file form 2553 to become an s-corp. The benefits of an s-corp is that taxation is passed on to the shareholder (you if you're the only owner of this corporation) instead of being taxed at the corporate level as well. I don't know the full scope of how profit levels might affect how this pans out but I can say from personal experience that it's fine if you have yours designated as an s-corp. But at the end of the day, consult with another trusted CPA if you want sound advice for your specific circumstance.

“How much should I pay my employees?”

This is always a question that I’m fascinated by the answers people respond with. 

Without outright saying it the general consensus is to pay what you can get away with. To squeeze profits out of employees. 

If you’re a business owner, how’d that work out for you when you were working for someone else? They squeezed you for as much profit as they could get and you felt burnt out, frustrated, taken advantage of, disrespected and more.

And that’s the answer that we’re going to go with when we run a business? To take advantage of the next generation of therapists who don’t know better?

I just heard a quote that trauma that’s unhealed is repeated. Let’s be a part of breaking the cycle not repeating it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** All of this is true. You need to pay them their worth and you also need to make sure you’re making at least 20-25% profit. You can’t just look at reimbursement related to pay to your contractor. As a business owner, you have other overhead to consider: EMR, rent, supplies and most importantly, risk. Be fair to them and be fair to yourself. A business that breaks even is not a business.

> **Response 2:** Good discussion point and very timely,  as I'm offering full time positions,  lol. I always felt that when I had a business,  I would pay fairly, and  better as the business did well. I also like the idea of base pay, but opportunity to earn more by doing more.  
Since you started the discussion,  I would love to hear others' ideas of pay, benefits and other rewards that keep employees engaged and happy.

Is it possible to sell your hybrid practice if you are the only clinician, a 3 year old clinic with 100+ google reivews a good profit margin and revenue of 15-18k a month in a growing city and building is in s good location

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding is that a business is more attractive when the money coming in has nothing to do with you (e.g. others generate your revenue). The buyer tends not to care about things like Google reviews, novelty of practice, etc., they just care about the EBITDA. Even after selling, the buyer will likely expect you to be part of the practice for 18+ months to transition and get established. That's just based on one conversation I had with a broker. My practice has several employees, so maybe it's different for a solo practice.

> **Response 2:** At one point I was just curious what my business was worth so I had someone that buys similar businesses look at mine. The #1 thing they said is, can the business survive if me/the owner wasn't around and is the brand recognition solely built around me. If it relies heavily on the owner, there is much less value then a practice with other therapists. Having contracts with referral partners helps build value as well

For anyone who is self-employed, who do you use for health insurance? I gave up full-time benefits at my previous job to pursue my own business, but I need health insurance for myself and my three kids. Not sure where to start or what insurance carrier doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Christian Healthcare Ministries. It’s a cost sharing plan, but has been phenomenal. Case I’m point…my labrum repair with BCBS cost me nearly $8000 in ADDITION to premiums that were close to $1000/mo for the 3 of us. Clavicle repair in 2019 with CHM cost me $0 with premiums of about $400-450/month for us 3. Wife got tossed from her horse and literally landed on her head resulting in just a concussion thank goodness, but also a $35K ER bill. Again we paid $0. You pay OOP for routine stuff, but well worth it imo.

> **Response 2:** We use Medi share! We pay 400 a month for a family plan with 8k family “deductible”. A local direct primary care doctor told me about Zion as well, which is a sharing program but is not faith based in nature.

I started with the idea of having a mobile physical therapy practice, just me, resigned to the idea that I will likely have to rely on Medicare payment as my source of income, because people in my area won't want to pay cash for my services. This would limit my earning potential as I can only see so many people in a day and Medicare will only pay so much, but as long as I can replace my corporate job paycheck, it will be good enough.

I found out about the Uncaged Clinician coaching program and thought, "Well that sounds great, but there is no way I can afford to pay for that and recoup the cost considering the (perceived) ceiling of my income." And, I will admit, I'm on the cheap side when it comes to paying for things, so the program seemed very cost-prohibitive for me. Not.gonna.do.it.

I was willing to talk to [Keghan Crossland](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252761052764366/user/548311312/?__cft__[0]=AZU8HqJlgHPyNxm4L0VPPL86p49te_ONVgpLnPiR1ZngfgvYZ7p7A8aVIhDX_lW2cAfOPdZ2n3r1CiE4NOfORoZjRax5x8UdbU_pRJ94lVpKVlelx_Dd48IJbyyFYrBwjb1miO5IM9jGlUFwPNP4dkeE&__tn__=-]K-R), though, because you know, *free.* He then told me that I should at least do a growth strategy call with [David Bayliff](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252761052764366/user/1269938479/?__cft__[0]=AZU8HqJlgHPyNxm4L0VPPL86p49te_ONVgpLnPiR1ZngfgvYZ7p7A8aVIhDX_lW2cAfOPdZ2n3r1CiE4NOfORoZjRax5x8UdbU_pRJ94lVpKVlelx_Dd48IJbyyFYrBwjb1miO5IM9jGlUFwPNP4dkeE&__tn__=-]K-R). I mean, I'm still not going to pay for the program, but, what the heck, it's *free.*

So, I talked to David, and then...I started to really see the value of the program...that this *could* be an investment in myself to grow a business bigger than what I originally thought. "Am I just drinking the Kool-aid," I thought? It's still a lot of money. Money that I don't currently have. But I was seriously considering it.

Then I had the opportunity to reach out and speak to someone went through the program and started her own successful mobile PT practice.  She graciously and generously answered my business related questions and also shared her experience with the Uncaged Clinician coaching program...and that sealed the deal.  And so now, I am officially a member of the Uncaged Clinician Pathway program!

So the lesson here: I was not interested in paying for this program at all, BUT, after learning more about it, I was able to realize the value that it offers me. So now I am working on changing my mindset. There are people out there that will not be interested in paying cash for my services, BUT if I can show them the value it provides to them, I just might change their minds like I changed my mind.

And there is the power of word of mouth. I mean, while I was very interested in the program after talking to David, it still felt like a lot of money. But after talking to someone who experienced it and valued it (someone that I didn't even know), I felt good about committing myself to the program.

So here I am, so excited to be a part of the program and for the possibilities that await. Let's GOOOO!

Does anyone have the cut and dry numbers for how much revenue per therapist should be brought in to be successful for both mobile and brick and mortar? Assume 12-18% profit per therapist.  Assume just above average pay.

Also once base systems are set up, the impact on profit becomes greater with each hire.....

I have a former patient who wants to hire me for wellness to help him to work on overall strength. I’m driving to him and told him that my rate is $150/session.

He’s agreeable but doesn’t think he can afford to see me often. Am I pricing myself out or just setting my value? 

Considering offering him a lower rate to see him more often too.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was always taught that if you don't value your time, nobody else is going to do it for you 🙏

> **Response 2:** If they want strength- they can find a trainer for $50/hour at the local gym. If they want a doctor of PT with unlimited expertise in healthcare as well as being the top specialist in strength and conditioning, who also travels as concierge, $150 is a steal. Do not change that price. Sometimes I’ll consult with their trainer as a courtesy. So they’ll see me for PT and they can get adjunct strengthening from the trainer. I do the same for massage therapists, chiropractors, etc. If they truly want your time and your expertise, they just have to pay for it. You can give them that option and I guarantee they’ll choose you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Insurance caps limit the pay offered however for me my costs such as child care ,transportation, outsourced help needed to run the house are necessities that are rising in cost. If I could work the hours my kids are in school and have more flexibility for emergency care or school holidays then it would make sense to work however that just isn’t offered . Ultimately I have left the field for all these reasons.

When you started out on your own, what did you do for personal health insurance? I’m currently in school based and hired directly so I have great insurance and my husband’s is meh 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Curious as to what y’all have found! We are currently 2 adults and 1 child in Illinois at the moment. Currently paying somewhere between $350 and $375 per pay period (2x/month) for the family.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Something to keep in mind (I did a lot of digging into this)…

If you do a plan through ACA or a private insurance company you can often pay the premiums through your business. You’ll need to check with your accountant and it’s based on the type of business structure. My understanding is you can’t do that with healthshares because they aren’t in the right tax category for the accounting forms. Also, they are not guaranteeing care. It can be a gamble for people with pre-existing conditions (protected under ACA - for now).

It’s important to look into all of it because each person will have different needs, risk profiles, risk aversions etc. If one is young with no pre-existing conditions and is cool with paying a low premium out of pocket - health shares can be great. 

It will also depend on your income. If you can get subsidies through ACA - it’s a great option. 

High earners face a lot of challenges with this.

I had an employer ask me about how someone who is an entry level employee or low wage income worker could access my expertise if I don't accept insurance. For so many reasons, I  never plan on billing insurance or participating. Just curious if any of you do sliding fee scales based on income level? Is it even legal? And how are you  providing access for all clients, not just those with disposable incomes?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have had people pay for my services with their stimulus checks. 

A woman went and got a job at a daycare after being a stay at home mom for 15+ years. Why? Because her husband refused to pay for her treatment with me. She came back after saving for a few months and paid full with her own money. (I didn’t just empower her with her health but now she has her own income and confidence to not stay dependent on another human for her well-being.) 

At times, we have to allow people to figure out how they will get what they desire. It allows them to rise above their excuses. 

That is not to say we shouldn’t discount our services at all. But it would take a lot before someone can convince me why I should earn less so that they can save on their health. 

The same people have the money for tattoos, $400 eyelashes, 100s of $$ of hair styles and highlights, money for beer on weekends, money for all the gadgets and car stuff. 

They need to figure out where they can save or earn more to pay for my expertise. 

I used to have a real difficult time not getting sucked into people’s sad stories until a coach said “would you take food out of your child’s mouth to feed someone else? That’s what you are doing when you don’t charge what you are worth. You are taking it away from your child.” That really hit home for me. 

Also, people who pay the full price are the same people who are most compliant and actually get results. In the past, everytime I discounted my services beyond my comfort level, the people didn’t even put in the work. 

People have to have their skin in the game. What they are willing to pay for soemthing is a direct reflection of how much they value it.

> **Response 2:** It is not my responsibility to be a financial advisor for my patients. It IS my responsibility to run a sustainable business model so that I am here for years to come and don’t have close my business because I’m not profitable. I can help the biggest amount of patients by running a sustainable business model that yes, includes profitability. There are rare instances where I give patients pay-what-you-can visits. ￼ Ironically, I have had some of those patients I tried to help with discounts not be grateful and no-show to those appointments. ￼

Question about cancelation fees -- I run a mobile practice. We charge $50 per cancelation. I've been having staff as if they get a "cut" of this fee. I've always been on the 'hard no' side of this debate because I feel like that scenario is rife for abuse. But now I don't know... Staff satisfaction is hugely important to me, and if it matters to them then I'd consider it. What do you all normally do and what's your experience? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, we always paid staff for cancellations whether % of fee or hourly rate no matter if they were contract, 1099, or reg emp. That fee is to cover their time and expected pay just as much as yours.

> **Response 2:** If I was the one who wasted my time and gas driving to the patient’s house, but you got the cancellation fee, I would not feel appreciated. If I was the one who had to rearrange my schedule at the last minute because of the cancellation, but you got the cancellation fee, I would not feel appreciated. If I had to sit around and waste my time because I couldn’t find someone to fill the opening created by the cancellation, but you got the cancellation fee, I would not feel appreciated. If you feel that you have a trustworthy and conscientious staff that you want to keep, share the fee. If anyone abuses it, deal with them. But I feel that companies that appreciate therapists are rare, so when we are lucky enough to get hired by one we take care of that company and don’t abuse their appreciation. Is it worth $25-50 to you to make your employees feel like you value their time the way you would value your own?

For those who are doing mobile PT and/or pelvic health PT and have hired other PTs, how/what do you pay your therapists? Hourly/salary/rate? 
(In Texas)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I hired a pelvic floor PT (in my brick and mortar clinic) and she has a commission rate - so base pay is one rate and that’s for any non-patient / non-revenue time like consults, documentation, marketing etc and then she gets a commission rate per service for times when she’s bringing in revenue (evals, treatment sessions). 

I consulted with an employment attorney to make sure that was legal and allowed, and my employee and I agreed on a base rate. 

So for instance, if she works an 8 hour day I pay her 8 hours at the base rate and if she sees 6 patients that day she gets $xx per patient x 6 extra for that day. She earns more when she does patient care, which is what I hired her for. I own a 100% cash based practice, for reference. This gives her more incentive and accountability for converting patients to evals and full POCs - which helps me avoid burn out from having so much pressure to fill her schedule - we both benefit when she’s fully booked 🌟🌟

*also want to note that I’m hiring again so if anyone in Colorado Springs is interested (or knows of anyone looking for an amazingly supportive place to work…message me )

Help needed:

I have a cash based business where I specialize working with runners and triathletes. I do a lot of wellness visits /running evaluations. I had someone reach out to me who lives over an hour away and asked if I have a surcharge fee for going that far and I wanted to get everybody’s opinion on how much you’d recommend charging. With gas being so expensive and extra time driving that far wanted to be fair. I charge $130 for a basic evaluation and typically $150 for a separate running evaluation with fully analysis. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** $130-150/hr normal rate 

Driving to/from will be two hours of your time not including business expense of mileage on vehicle and gas. 

Definitely charge for time and expenses. 

Something like 20% of normal service charge for out of radius visits plus $.05/mile?

Or just a flat rate that changes with the market if you want simplicity

> **Response 2:** I wouldn't charge extra. Think of it as an extra marketing and extra word of mouth. Another person changed. Good luck my friend!

Has anyone gone from cash-based to in-network? I love my clinic and what we do… but since I hired another therapist I can’t get enough clientele to make overhead. But then if I switch I feel like I’m going to end  up like every other mill in my town and I refuse to do that.  But I know others in here do insurance…. I saw my bosses in my old jobs rolling in dough while I was barely make ends meet…. How does insurance reimburse these days?  I have someone trying to convince me to be a multi-specialty clinic because it reimburses more… is that true? Has anyone done this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I see this a lot, so I’ll be direct but hopefully helpful.

Most of the time the issue isn’t cash vs insurance. It’s that cash practices expect being cash + good clinical care to magically solve hiring and filling schedules. That works when you’re solo. It breaks the second you hire.

When you were alone, you had low overhead and lots of time. You could network, run workshops, meet people, hustle. Your hire is not going to do that at the same level, and they shouldn’t be expected to. At that point, you need real systems.

Cash pay clinics that scale well all have a few things in place:
• Strong sales skills from the first phone call through the eval
• Clear package presentation (you have to sell packages)
• Continuity options so people don’t disappear once pain improves
• An intentional marketing channel that doesn’t rely on the owner’s time

On the insurance side, one thing I saw in the comments stood out. If BCBS reimburses better than your cash rates, that’s a pricing issue. Your cash rates are too low.

I totally get wanting to help more people, but once you charge anything above $0, you’re already excluding someone. So you might as well price in a way that lets you run a sustainable business, pay staff well, and not burn out. Don’t pick prices everyone can afford. Pick prices that support the business and the life you want.

Multi-specialty can reimburse more, but it also adds complexity and doesn’t fix weak sales or marketing. Plenty of multi-specialty clinics still struggle for the same reasons.

Before jumping in-network, I’d fix sales, marketing, packaging, and pricing first. Cash pay can work very well, but only when it’s run intentionally.

> **Response 2:** in what part of the country are you located?
In network benefits (BCBS) vary a lot depending on location.

I know PTs can’t order X-rays and have them reimbursed for insurance, but is there anything that says we can’t own X-ray machines and charge cash?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think the bigger question you should be asking is, someone gets injured and maybe breaks a bone, are they gonna call their PT or go to an emergency department? I've told people to go to urgent care over fractured collar bones (which are 99%+ non-op) and everyone still insists on going to the ED even though collar bone fractures are not life threatening. So imagin is a moot point. PTs no matter what will always be one of the last places people to go for a radiograph. While we can manage a lot of injuries, splinting and casting is not in this tool kit and the patient still needs to be referred out. (knowing what you don't know and when to refer in itself is a sign of expertise). If you're looking to push for added income, there are better places to look. The cost of a machine vs return on investment seems like we'd have to do multiple unnecessary images to even break even. Not to mention the unnecessary radiation this exposes patients and staff to. Also, our profession needs to focus on the issues that already exist like fighting third parties who steal our income, dealing with prior authorization processes that are impossible, making referral for profit illegal, etc......so many better things to focus on.

> **Response 2:** That’s a tough one, check your state laws. I’m betting to say no. Diagnostics equipment has been getting more cost effective. I think this should be an agenda for the APTA , they should get on the ball for certification classes to allow competent PTs to read X-ray ( think rural health). Ultrasound for imaging services as well. Good question though. And can’t compare with chiro , they have extensive knowledge on imaging compared to a DPT . Gotta give credit where credit is due.

Hey everyone. So I’m looking at a space to rent in a chiropractor’s office. It’s a massage room and I do like the area. I’m just starting out and he suggested $65/ hr or $250/day would be the going rate. He said those numbers are from someone he rented the space to a while back but they were from a bigger company. 
I told him I’m just starting out and that it may just be once a week as I build up clients. He said that the rates aren’t firm and would be up for more discussion. 
For those who have been in this position; do you guys think this rental rate is typically fair? Or too high? 
Just wanted to get thoughts; I think it a bit high.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I pay 400 for a room for a month;)

> **Response 2:** $65/ hr?! That’s a lot of money! My first room I rented was $25/ hr and that was in Los Angeles! I now have a suite that I pay $875/ month now so the $250 a day is a rip off too!!! Look else where!

Anyone? In over two years I have not received anything like this. I didn’t request this. And I am 99. 99% sure I am not interested as the person who saw me was happy to pay me the money because I actually solved their problem in one visit. Yes, I am out of network. ￼￼￼

**Community Responses:**

They are probably trying to negotiate a massively discounted rate.

They’re no better than the NF lawyer, who waits till the end of the case, gets all your notes, then offers you 50 cents in the dollar to “let’s resolve this claim quickly”

For those who accept credit cards do you use square or another app? I don’t know where to begin

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Venmo tap to pay. Low processing fees it’s nice

> **Response 2:** Square is best for its user friendly platform and mobile app. However, you do pay for it!! 3.7% transaction fees and no refunds on fees when reversing a transaction. 
I’ve moved over to a more cumbersome system charging 2.4%. It’s a pain compared to square but the savings are $10k plus per year for us.

It's FRIDAY!! 

You know what that means, people. 

Time to **KICK IT UP A NOTCH!**

Excited for my dude, Steven Baptiste.  His clinic, *Elev8 Movement LLC*, was nominated for *Best of Gwinnett County* (Atlanta, GA)! LET'S GOOOOO!! 

Kicking It Up BIG TIME tomorrow will be Ashley Will.  She is getting married in beautiful Sedona, AZ! CONGRATS!! 

Crystal Abitz dropped some big news this week.  She announced that the family will be growing to a party of 5 in the Spring! WOO! HOO! 

Jeremy Sutton is making strides in his practice, Healthy SBC  (Shreveport - Bossier City, LA)  He has announced that he soon will be adding a location to compliment the mobile aspect! GROWING, BROTHER!!! 

One way to grow Famousity is to appear in the local magazine.  That's exactly what Josh Lopez did this week. His spread (and mug shot) on *Should Getting Stiffer As We Age Really Be Considered Normal?* appeared in the *Active Senior Living of Mohave County* (AZ)!! 

Bill Johnson has grown his practice to 2 therapists now after only 13 months in business! But he's not done.  A third will be starting soon! UNCAGED!!!! 

Perhaps the grandest way to KICK IT UP is to bring life into the world. BIG CONGRATS to Meagan Duncan and hubby Jason who welcomed their newest bundle of joy, little Cael Phillip! 

Wedding Bliss abounds! CONGRATS to April Manint Egan who got married!!!

Shout Out to Kevin Hamidi who spoke at the 6th IFCA Legacy retreat! SOLID, bro!!

I am beyond stoked for Kelly Shannon, the personal physical therapist for women's professional tennis player, Emma Navarro, currently ranked #10 in the world.  Navarro made it to the semi-finals of the women's US OPEN - her first major semi-final! Although she lost, it was an incredible leap in her journey. WAY TO HAVE HER IN TIP TOP SHAPE, KELLY!! 

We ain't done with the US Open! Wolfgang Oswald, personal PT for men's #12 player, Taylor Fritz, has his player playing in his first Major semi-final as well!  LET'S GOOO! 

Selfishly, I gotta give a shout out to my "Black Sheep" classmates from Shenandoah Univ Class of '94 who are gathered for our 30th Reunion!  I wish I was there with you all!!

Looking for advice and suggestions. 
I own a small cash based OT practice in FL. 
With my practice I do private sessions in homes and group based sessions in the community. From adult to older adult. I recently stopped all of my PRN work to dive full time in my practice. Life has hit a little harder than expected, I am in a place where I need to find a side position to make additional income. Any ideas of what side hustles to do? I am torn between doing another OT position or just something completely different on the side to give my brain an OT break due to the stress of starting an OT company. I am feeling extremely defeated. Also, for those that have a cash based practice how long did it take to really get going?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Taking Medicare would definitely open a larger client population for you. People often don't realize the time required to build community connections and establish a reputation. OT is harder than PT for sure. I am happy to chat with you about options to build your practice.

> **Response 2:** I manage my husband’s mobile PT practice and enrolling with Medicare made a huge difference (only traditional Medicare and OON with advantage plans), he still has cash patients and charges his rate and quite often Medicare patients become his private pay patients after discharge from Medicare services if they want to continue wellness. I myself  trade futures in the market. I feel it’s the best skill in the world but the hardest one to learn but if you master it you are golden. I only trade 1-3 hours in the evening, last night was great, I made more than double on 2 trades than working 10 hour shift as charge nurse with weekend differential lol. But it’s a skill like any other that you need to learn. Affiliate marketing, selling life insurance on the side, digital products are some other side hustles that our healthcare friends do for extra income. Feel free to DM me.

Hello! I am a PT in the Michigan area looking into starting my own practice. For those that used LegalZoom to register their LLC, did anyone pay for the highest cost package? I am tempted, only because it says it offers the formation of documents. I was wondering if they would help write consent forms, HIPAA agreements, consent for photos, etc. Is this what they would help with? Is it worth the cost, or should I just register on the michigan website and figure the rest out on my own?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No need to pay LegalZoom to register your LLC/PLLC in MI.  It's very easy to do on the state website.  I'm in MI as well

> **Response 2:** Michigan here. I can barely do this stuff and thr LLC was so easy! Don't pay for it!

Hello fellow clinicians. Can you guys give me a ball park of what you're charging cash based clients for evaluations and treatments. A ball park because I know there's different circumstances. 
Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am mobile I charge 150 for an eval 125 a visit. I typically stay in a small area.  I know two other therapists in my area who do clinic based cash PT, one charges 160 an  hour, with an intro price on the eval of 87 to get people in the door,  the other one 225   for an eval or visit. She has a very specific niche… runners.  Both own their own clinic with a second or third PT working with them.  

  I realize my prices are lower and I am mobile,  but some of my patients actually see me more than 1 times a week whereas with their business model they often will see someone and then have them come back maybe once a week, every 10 days,  or every other week, etc.

> **Response 2:** Thank you all so much. I live in FL. I wanted to make sure I'm fair across the board but also making a realistic business decision.

I’m from chicago. I’m in Fort Lauderdale right now. Met w a mobile MD group. I have been informed when they add POS  12 their rate is tripled. #letsfightforthis #3X

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not sure what Cuba Gooding has to do with us. But my question is point of service 12 is that considered “the patient’s home”? My rates are the same for reimbursement

> **Response 2:** Do they also have to confirm homebound status? The mobile MD notes that I see have statements for why the patient needs to be seen in the home. I would guess, on average, HH PT visits under Medicare A are around double per visit than a part B visit

“What’s the cost to get my own business started?”
There are two different angles to consider…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** After almost 2.5 years I realize for those not doing it or not making it “happen” either don’t want it enough or have someone else enabling them … has to be. I pruned out the people who didn’t support me or didn’t raise me up. It works

> **Response 2:** I have one bag with all my stuff (including first aid kit and BP cuff).

Sometimes I bring along heavier stuff, like you said.

Sometimes I consolidate and put the bare necessities in the carry case for my treatment table.

Super doable!

I’m growing impatient. I’m a mobile massage therapist for now, doing fine. I have much more to offer, and I feel I would grow faster if I have a physical space. 

PhD in Human and Sports Performance
MA in Sport Psychology
LMT
CSCS

What are some resources that could help me break the mental blocks and go for that physical space? Right now I feel like I’m in a catch-22 situation where I need more clients and revenue to justify the rental space, but if I had a rental space I could have greater biz growth and potential. How can I get from where I am to where I want to be? Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You already said it. You will grow faster with a physical space. I say go for it! That's what I did. 😁😁😁

Just took the leap of faith and the rest is history. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** Look all the time for rental spaces. You need to find the happy medium between great location and affordable. When I signed my lease in Jan this year I had literally 2 clients and neither of them were people who could come in to my studio. I was taking a huge risk, but the space I found was never going to come back again. So I took the leap, and now a slow week for me is 18 visits working 8:30-2:30, including seeing those 2 clients at their homes still. All this is to say: the number are scary. Risk is scary. But we have to do scary things to accomplish stuff… so take the leap! You can do it!

My wife and I are planning on starting our own practice in June!  We want to go ahead and file for LLC and get an ein etc.  In everyone's experience would it be best just to file the LLC address as our home address, and change it later, since we wouldn't have a physical office location until June. Or better to keep that separate and have a p.o.box?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can always change the address later. It’s not a problem to do so 👍

Have a PT who is pregnant and is going to be taking maternity leave.

She doesn’t qualify for FMLA as she just started working 5 months ago. But we do have paid maternity leaveve

My question: we offer 6 weeks of maternity leave that’s paid. How do I go about asking her how long she plans on taking off? Like if she wanted to take more after those 6 weeks. Just so we have a start back date that we can transition her patients back to her. Do we go ahead and set that now?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** YES - talk now. Just know that plans may change. But, have an idea in your head of how things may/may not play out. 

Talk with her, as if she was your own daughter, sister, wife, friend, etc. 

In my past personal experiences working for someone else, the more they treated me like a human, with kindness and understanding, the more I respected and desired to please my employer. 

It’s sad, but most leaders don’t get this. Men, in particular. 

Demonstrating kindness, empathy, or compassion when communicating is not a sign of weakness. **You can be a strong leader while still being kind.

Obviously, when an employee takes advantage of the employer’s kindness or empathy, that is an issue. The employer must take action to ensure it doesn’t happen more than once. 

Giving each employee the benefit of the doubt, in the beginning, is the best approach, in my opinion. 

Be direct and honest with her about YOUR needs as an employer/business owner, while simultaneously demonstrating understanding for her situation. 

Any reasonable person understands you need to ensure you have a physical PT in the clinic to treat clients until she returns. 

Let us know how the talk goes - interested to hear how it plays out!

> **Response 2:** First things first… way to go offering some paid maternity leave. That is a huge blessing for families! 

Secondly, I’d just request a meeting and chat about it! Then recheck in at the 6 week mark in case she changes her mind so you have time to adapt.

So I thought I had the beginning figured out, I went through Bootcamp and my last day at my fulltime job was July 1.

2 days ago, I applied for my LLC registration which ended up getting cancelled because I used the wording, physical therapy and wellness. Incfile.com said those words require me to file a pllc in Texas. Fine... but most online platforms don't do pllcs. I found one called mycorporation.com but I have no idea if this is reputable.  Similar cost structure to Legal zoom, etc. $100 for the basics plus extra for EIN, business licenses, annual reports. (Are these things hard to do yourself?) Versus $900 through the lawyer I contacted. I don't know what else I need... are their business licenses I need other than my own license and EIN? I'm doubting my own common sense and feeling stupid and indecisive.  I just want to get started legally, safely.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go to your Secretary of State website and do it yourself. Super easy

> **Response 2:** Do it yourself, file directly with state. Also stop paying biz coaches. There are great free resources out there

If you had an “easy” job making $125k/salary a year (in a low cost living area) - would you still make the leap to being Uncaged? 

Wanting to hear both sides. I’ve had PTs say I’m crazy for considering leaving. IVe had PTs say I’m crazy for not leaving. (If anyone doesn’t care, I’d love to know how much YOU made last year as an uncanged clinician)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I left a job I loved making a little less than that to be home with my son, which is priceless. I have an online business and work while he naps, and will be replacing my PT salary this year. 

I think it depends on the quality of clinics available to you, the energy that particular job gives or takes away, as well as familial circumstances.

> **Response 2:** The answer is it always depends. Depends on your stage in life. Depends on what you want to risk. I left a 125k job to start my private practice and now obviously make more than that. 😁😁😁

I say go for it. The 124k job will always be there. The opportunity to be Uncaged and start a business won't be there. Don't live a life of regrets. YOLO. 😁😁😁

I wanted to give a shout out to the UNCAGED program! Initially, when I began Pathway, I was lost and didn’t know how to start or navigate my business. In fact, I didn’t believe that the program will work for me. However, I decided to immerse myself in the program anyway. In one year, I had learned and experienced a substantial personal and business growth. From learning how to personally approach and acquire patients, properly handle business finances and overcoming my limiting beliefs. I want to extend my gratitude the UNCAGED coaches: David Bayliff and Kevin DeGroot, Josh Payne, Hanna DeGroot and Cara Bayliff… I would highly recommend the Uncaged team if you are trying to start a PT business and are tired of feeling caged in your corporate position…I’m glad I did!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** SO good! Thank you George Sklovskiy PT

> **Response 2:** Brother George Sklovskiy PT! This is incredible! Thank you. I have seen you grow tremendously in all areas, and I couldn’t be happier or more proud for you!! 
You are on your way to BIG THINGS!
🙌💪👊🕺🦁❤️

If you’re wondering about your value and how much to charge, in my community people charge $70/hr or $350-$500 to set up and decorate a Christmas tree with client-provided ornaments. We have to know AND show our value to our clients.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yeah very rich people pay that. The large majority of America is paycheck to paycheck. I’ve said this before… PT isn’t a one and done. You can probably get a lot of people to pay 300 bucks for an eval where you give them some great advice and get them going, but the large majority of people are not paying close to that 10-30 times. I’m sure some will say they’ve done it but i haven’t had many people who ended PT after 6 visits unless it was an active person with an ankle sprain.

> **Response 2:** 1x a year compared to multiple times per week....

**Original Post:**
Does anyone here charge a flat fee “extra” for same day and/or holiday appointments? I never have, but I have one patient specifically who always contacts me asking for an appt that same day, often within hours. Sometimes I can, and I do. Sometimes I do not have childcare set up since it wasnt a prior made appt, and I turn down the appt that day. Now, if I can make it work, I do and always have, but the incentive of extra charge if requesting an appt within hours seems appealing but also maybe not haha. 

What about holidays?

Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Charge extra for holidays/vacations and out of hours visits. 
I’ve lived by this and some clients don’t care and some do. They schedule to what fits their needs. I’m also a strong believer in “no” is a full sentence. You can treat them if you want or not without explanation. 

Your practice- you do it how it best suits you. 

PS- did the holiday rates last year for PT visits because I had intended  to take off for the holiday. Got inundated with calls for visits. Upped my rates and no one complained. So guess whose rates went up 😉 sometimes it’s a nice way to see if a price increase will be accepted by your clientele. 

Good luck!

> **Response 2:** For holidays and outside of normal hours makes sense… same day I don’t. I just get excited I can fill a gap

I currently see all of my patients out of my brick and mortar and am all cash based. I just received a message from someone reaching out about doing home visits for their friend who had a stroke because transportation is difficult. It sounds like she is about 15 minutes from my office. Do I charge the same prices as my office visits or more because I need to travel and delegate more time for these appointments to accommodate the travel?  My heart says charge the same but my mind says increase the cost due to the increased time it will take out of my day. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is there any way you can fill the time in your space with someone else while you’re out? I have a client I see 2x/wk at his house. I’m there for about an hour and block 15 min on each side for travel. I was able to find a yoga teacher who uses that hour to teach a class while I’m gone. I get a small cut and the space isn’t sitting unused.

> **Response 2:** I work for a California based home health agency, and the per session rate for PT is $374. Just an FYI to compare your own rate to.

Have stagnant growth?

Most businesses don’t have a marketing problem, they have an identity problem.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes!

> **Response 2:** Samy Dees it’s always the mean ol Capitalists’ fault. PT should be about helping and healing people while getting paid or paying yourself what you’re worth.  The beauty of capitalism is that if you don’t like what you’re getting paid you can always go work somewhere else or start your own biz. Under any other economic model if you don’t like what you’re getting paid - tough. 

Life is tough. Get a 🪖.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I strategically signed my lease in an office just behind a Stretch Zone. I get quite a few clients who trickle over to book with me after they realize the other place is not a good fit for them.

> **Response 2:** Stretching is one of the most unnecessary things one can do. Not harmful in anyway, but far from a necessity. There’s ample research showing it doesn’t prevent injury

Where can I post besides indeed and LinkedIn?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Peds wasn't a very high paying niche till recently, it demands high salaries ATM, super tight job market overall doesn't help. Start going through your contacts and start reaching out to local hospitals based Peds therapist

I am SAHM of 10 months old, not planning to join work for atleast next 6 months, But m stressed out a lot at home and thinking if I can start something from home like stretching sessions and wellness which will not include skilled services.
Note: I am a resident of KY and have Indiana PT license.
My question is what can I do to legally start these services at my home, do I need to get certification in stretching, then I start?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why would you need a stretching certificate if you're a PT? You need liability insurance and can do anything within your scope and practice.

> **Response 2:** Why not do virtual PT sessions and market in Indiana 
$50+ for 30 min visits

Geriatric PTs- what services are you offering to your patients that are not covered by Medicare to increase revenue/ visit???  One of my 2026 goals is to offer more cash pay services in addition to typical Medicare PT session, looking for inspiration.  Right now the only one I currently offer is dry needling.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love that you are asking this question. A lot depends on what you or your team really enjoys doing. 

You already know but I generate the extra income we need through media and affiliate income. 

Selling products is usually an easy one to add. With Amazon’s next day delivery on a lot of items you could easily buy and resell stuff like little pedal exercisers, walking pads, etc. 

Other services like taking your client out of the house, go to a game, go to the park, go run some errands. As long as you are out of the house it is not a covered service. 

We had a PTA who would travel with patients on cruises. This one is a bit more extreme but he got the free trip and set hours that he was “on duty.” He was paid for that time and could do what he wanted the rest of the time. I could see this working for flights as well.

Need some thoughts on an opportunity. I currently treat both MCR and cash pts with my fully mobile practice . I charge $150/visit. I was approached by a local country club with a large membership. They would like me to treat their members at the club. They would take 20% of monies. I told them $175/ visit (the idea is to recoup the 20%).  I would be there for maybe 4-5 hrs at a clip. Am I being greedy to ask for the $175/visit? Thoughts on $175 for eval and then $150 return visits? Thanks, everyone!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Someone in a pelvic floor group I follow put it this way: “I just paid $200 to have a clown at my kids bday party for an hour”. Consider that when setting your rates.

> **Response 2:** I’ve actually have done this in the past. Worked well but the must earn their 20% , I believe it was 20% for me as well 

1. You cannot treat Medicare there unless you get that site blessed by Medicare 
2. The country club better have all the equipment you need to effectively do your job 
3. The country club likely will be handling all the money up front ie drawing from their members accounts on a monthly basis   So you need to ensure your books are accurate so they pay you correctly 
4. The country club should assist you on scheduling their members with their front desk/spa staff. 
5. They should also market on your behalf as 20% of 10 clients vs 100 clients is much more advantageous to them. 
6 your rates seem low but all of that is area dependent, and what you are comfortable charging. We aee 275 eval 175 follow up 350 ultrasound diagnostics. Commonly an eval will pull in $625 in an hour  and the members love it.

For those of you who started your business while working for another company in some capacity , how do you get around the conflict of interest statement usually found in the companies handbook? 

*** I did not sign a non compete , this clause is in the handbook ***

I currently still work part time 20 hours at an outpatient facility and have a side business that I’m building but I’m hesitant to go hard core with my marketing due to the conflict of interest statement in our handbook which states : 

“@@ employees must not do anything where their personal interests could conflict or reasonably appear to conflict with the interests at ( this company ) . 
For example, it you were to participate in any business opportunity where you might receive personal financial gain apart from your normal wages, you could be in a conflict of interest situation. 

Personal Financial Gain

You should not take any money separate from your normal wages that could affect your decision making
abilities as a @@ emplovee such as:

You or a family member taking money from a company that does business with this company. 

You or a close family member having ownership in a business that competes with this company 

Outside Activities
You should avoid outside work or actions that could could have a bad effect on ( this companies ) reputation in the community
or could conflict with vour duty to (this company)” 

I’m probably going to make an appointment with an employment layer. But I’m curious because I have not heard anyone address this issue when starting up a business . Most people I have listened too actually encourage you work part time or at least PRN while building. 

** also side note PRN with this company is a W2 so handbook rules still apply **

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I spoke to my direct supervisor when getting started. My business is mobile and online which is not something my job offered. 

To avoid conflict of interest, I didn’t speak about my business at work. When I ended up leaving the job and patients asked where I was going, I said I was changing jobs/settings. Some found me online and started working with me on their own. I never told them to

> **Response 2:** As long as you aren’t directly marketing to patients at your current job or “stealing” employees at your current job i don’t see a conflict or problem

Ok, so I was just sitting at the bank, waiting to talk to the manager about opening a business checking account. My wife gets a call from a neighbor who is asking about the name of the home health company I work for. Turns out, she knows someone who is looking for home based cash Physical therapy!!! What are the odds?!?  I’ve barely started to tell people I’m starting a business, and then this! Wow! So pumped right now!

What is your favorite tactic for increasing prices? some are on a package and others are pay per visit and others are continued per visit at the package price discounted rate for a coke more follow ups - what do you tell them? My brains too tired to find the right words. 

Aug 1 is my goal and I’m trying to figure out what’s “fair” time wise to get info out.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I recommend personally telling your current clients face to face. Offer them the opportunity to purchase more sessions at their current rate, or give them a heads up on when you’ll be raising the price. Treat them like VIP. Then send an email to your list - give them a chance to buy at ur old rate (if ur looking for a cash injection) and then start charging to new patients (who will be the first to pay the new price).

You don’t have to tell them why. In fact don’t justify. Just say you have a price increase. They don’t need to know the details.

> **Response 2:** Raise prices on new clients only..

Start AUG 1....     

And tell current clients prices are going up, yet you value them so much and as a thank you you will keep them on the original price 

WIN - WIN

Good luck

Hi everyone! What are your thoughts on this?

I literally just started my "side hustle" cash-based business (I have two clients right now) as I'm still employed with my F/T job. I don't want to leave my F/T job for personal reasons. My only available hours to see potential patients would be from 5:30-8PM. I offer PT, personal training and recovery services.

A nearby gym has offered me to use their space and market my business to their members. They are allowing me to have full access to their 1000 sq ft gym with office/private room/equipment availability. The rent would depend on how many people I attract but the low end would be $1000/month (not sure what that means -- why can't it be a fixed amount?). If I only saw 2-3 patients/week, they said it wouldn't be worth it. I think I can cover the lower end of the monthly rent with one person's 10-session package BUT I'm worried about "will I have time for myself?", "will seeing 10 patients/week be too overwhelming?", "what if I can't even get people to buy in my services and now I have to cough up my own money to pay the rent" if I end up going this route. I eventually declined the offer for the moment but felt this might be a great opportunity.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** $1000/month for a 1000 Sq ft gym seems excessive. See if they are willing to give you a per hour rate. I pay $25/hour where I do side stuff. Normally only a few patients per week.
A per month rate that high would only make sense if you are there full time.

> **Response 2:** At first glance that sounds too high of rent for so a side hustle. If they really wanted you, I would try to negotiate a percentage of your billed amount.

Just starting my cash based business. I gave a patient my superbill with my EIN. She submitted to UHC and they're requesting a TIN not an EIN. I'm an individual owner LLC so I thought I just used my SSN on my taxes. I don't have a TIN, and I don't really want to put my SSN on my superbills. Any recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m thinking the insurance company is mistaken, if you have an EIN. All claims for my business for 5 years have only ever used the business EIN, as we had applied for that.

> **Response 2:** As I understand it, there are several kinds of TINs (Tax ID Number), including your SSN (social security number) and EIN. Therefore, your EIN *is* your TIN.

Looking for recommendations/ thoughts on what to charge when your staff PT needs PT from another clinician in your practice. We are a brick and mortar clinic and our rates are $250 for evaluation and $150-175 for 1 hour treatments. I know we all help each other few minutes here and there without charging- but this case needs a full hour consult and I want to put a policy around it. Appreciate any direction/ advice on this. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You charge nothing because that’s the right thing to do. Employee benefit

> **Response 2:** I’d say let that be a private arrangement between the two interested parties. I wouldn’t try to profit off of anything as a courtesy.

I will be trying out a shockwave device for a month. No cost . I am 90% sold on buying it (as long as it works the way it is supposed to). I have a few patients I know I want to try it on. I am alsconsidering advertising the device starting 1 week before I get the trial one because that will also give me an idea of interest of community. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have had Softwave since December and our patients are experiencing amazing results! It’s been a great addition to our clinic. Only regret is that we didn’t get it sooner!

To start we  had a day and set aside about 4 hours and scheduled patients to come in for a visit at a lower cost and from there they can decide to sign up or not. It helped get the word out without pushing it to patients and to grow awareness. This worked great for us.

> **Response 2:** I have Stemwave and it has made such a difference in my clinic.  What I did was just out it in every person that came in with no additional fee just to see how they responded.  They responded so well I kept it.

Hello everyone! 

I have a quick question. One of my patients approach me and asked me to provide private PT @ home in NYC after he run out of his Medicare B service.
 
What’s the legal and ethical way or procedure to start cash base (private pay)physical therapy services at home for Medicare B patients in NY after they already reach their market cap and wanted PT via private pay (out of pocket) . 

Can anyone clear my following doubts ..

1. Can I legally work with Med B as cash pay(out of pocket)..?

2. I have to get ABN form signed before I start as private pay for med B home care patient  ..!? Right

3. Or I have to sign any other wellness waiver form instead of ABN?

4. If work as private pay do I have to do documentation for PT treatment..?

Any information would be greatly appreciated along with format or any attachment for any form. 

Any suggestions on this would be greatly appreciated , as I am new to this private pay/cased base practice .

Thanks in advance .🙏🏻

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Firstly there is no cap. Medicare covers medically necessary skilled therapy services.  You can charge cash for services that are not covered by Medicare or do not meet the above criteria. If it is something that Medicare would normally cover but would not be covered in this case you would complete an ABN with the client prior to beginning services. For services Medicare would not normally cover e.g. dry needling or fitness program you would use your usual waiver. If it is skilled therapy that meets that criteria then it must be billed to Medicare. Therapists are not allowed to opt out and there is a mandatory claims submission requirement.

> **Response 2:** Milena Ryes  Thanks for your response. Yes I am providing PT under Medicare as I m working under private company as staff position. Yes patient  was trying to approach me for maintenance , I like your point for simple wellness note. What do you mean by do me t on simple wellness note..?Do you have format of simple wellness note ..? If yes can you please attach it over here..?

Hi everyone - asking a bit of broad question, but I definitely need input. I've been approached to provide PT services for a local home hospice company as an Independent Contractor, and I am interested. They've asked me to send them my rates - including for evaluations, follow-ups, and mileage. I've been a PT (DPT) for 11 years, 6 of which I spent working for a home health and hospice company. I also own an LLC providing mobile/concierge pelvic health privately, so the only comparison I have so far is what I charge for that, which is $145 for 90-minute evaluations and $95 for 60-minute follow ups. The home health co I PRN for pays $110 for a SOC (which I wouldn't do in this hospice setting), $70 for evals, and $60 for follow ups, and I live in South Mississippi. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would tell them your rates are higher and then begin negotiations. Will you be a 1099 or are you billing them ?

> **Response 2:** I don’t think that your rates are outrageous. Further, I don’t think that they are out of the ballpark.
It would seem that the worst thing that could happen is they would want to negotiate. 

“Here are my rates for the clients I’m serving in this area presently:”

If you were going to offer them any sort of discount (if they ask) you might consider it just because you wouldn’t have to necessarily work as hard for the referrals? I don’t think it’s necessary, though.

Looking for some advice. For those of you who started a side hustle while working FT and then transitioned to your business FT… At what point did you drop the full time job? 

I’ve been seeing 12-15 patients a week on my own while also working 35-40 hrs at my full time gig and I feel like I’m barely treading water. 😅 

I’m afraid to quit because of losing my insurance, and the fear of just relying on my business as income. Any guidance is appreciated. 🙂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 3 months

> **Response 2:** The time is now :) 12-15 is a great start! Be prepared that it can be financially tough for the first 6 months or so, but you've already got a good base. I also agree with others that if you weren't working the other job you could put full effort into your business. ❤️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There's a huge disconnect between what insurance companies tell patients and what they tell providers. This creates tension between providers and patients. If insurance only covers a few sessions a week, why can't we charge for wellness visits?

> **Response 2:** $950 (a class) vs $700 a month 1x a wk PT appt. out of pocket. People can’t keep up with $700 a month for an extended period of time. At that point your practice is only targeting those who can afford you. Yes, it really is disheartening our reimbursement rates because we shoukd be reimbursed closer to these rates. Are you all writing evaluations & notes for these prices?

Just listened to a podcast about a pool company who added a payment calculator to their website and their inbound leads went up by 200%. What do we think about adding a payment calculator to a website for cash pt?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think the main factor to consider here is that:

People WANT pools. Pools are aspirational in that they’re a status symbol, provide excitement and entertainment, and can be seen as raising the value of a home potentially.

Sadly, no one WANTS physical therapy. And honestly it would be weird for someone to want physical therapy (in the traditional sense of getting rehab for an injury).

Classic cost vs investment scenario. PT is seen as a cost whereas a pool is seen as an investment. 

Definitely worth giving it a shot but I don’t think it would drive leads. Just my guess!

> **Response 2:** I think it works great for an asset type product but prob not service based.

Hey guys- quick question.
I am 100% cash pay using gsuite for everything. Do i need to register as an OOP with a variety of insurances for my patients to receive reimbursment with superbills? I have a superbill template i created but have not actually had a pt attempt to use it yet. As of now the majority of my sessions are fitness and sport performance. I was reading an earlier post on this page that got me thinking about this….

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In being 100% cash based, you will be viewed as an out of network provider with all insurance. This is the language that they would use to refer to you. 
With this in mind, your patients need to be the contact for the insurance. We have had legal advisors tell us that speaking with the insurance would be a possible issue with HIPAA. 
We give the superbill when requested then if there are issues, ask the clients to call while in the office and we walk them through.

> **Response 2:** Hi, this is a bit of a piggyback on the original question.  I'm also self pay and provide superbills to patients.  Does anyone provide instructions to patients in written form of the steps when contacting their insurance or use an app for potential reimbursement?

Looking to change the name of my LLC. Is it easier to: 

1- create a new LLC, get a new EIN, and new bank account then switch over my online courses to this account
2- amend the current LLC name, amend the name with the IRS (EIN), and amend the name on the bank account and keep all my material as is

Considering it took the IRS 2+ months to get my husbands EIN due to naming similarities I am worried they are going to be nice and slow…. Anyone have experience with this and can give their two sense?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, do a DBA. Mine took 24 hours (legal zoom messed up my name). You file a form with the state, and then your LLC is “Doing Business As” the new name. Same EIN and everything. In Montana it was like $10 to change

Starting a business can be a lot more simple when given the right guidance. 

It’s my goal with Bootcamp to NOT give you an over abundance of information, but to give you the EXACT guidance you need to create the proper foundation for your business 👊

It’s not too late to jump in, we have 2/4 trainings left and you will be given access to the recordings of the first two trainings!

There is no time like the present to start building the right foundation for your dreams and not continuing to build someone else’s. 

Bootcampers, y’all have been a blast to coach so far! 

If you want more info, link is in the comments 👇

**Community Responses:**

Hi all,

I am in the process of starting a concierge cash mobile PT business. I know pricing on visits is a common question and I keep going back and forth on what to charge. My plan is to offer packages with the main one being basically unlimited visits until they meet their goals for $5000. Obviously there is going to be some stipulations for that to avoid people taking advantage. Otherwise, the goal will be to charge about $285 a visit. I am located in the Prescott/Prescott Valley area in Arizona. 

Looking for thoughts and opinions on this and what other mobile cash PTs have charged.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We are hybrid so I have two styles 

Cash only 
I’ve done this. We do 10k for the year. Unlimited treatment plans 

2k per month unlimited or 5500 for 3 months. For say like ACL R or TKA type thing. 

Also have an annual membership for the insurance side 
1500/year  annual wellness stuff plus discounts on cash services
4500/year  basically large discounts on cash services. Fitness. Exercise programming nutrition shockwaves ultrasound imaging etc 

We do have a B&M so that helps with more services to offer vs just the mobile providers.

To add. We’ve never had a single membership person overuse their membership. They actually understood the value and probably used it much less than say your typical insurance patient who expects the moon

> **Response 2:** Love seeing you building a concierge PT model that puts patients first! Curious what specific stipulations you’re including to protect your time with the $5K unlimited package. Also, what are other mobile cash PTs in the area charging per hour?

I’m considering renting space from a local clinic, and they’re proposing a percentage split with a cap, allowing me to earn 100% after the cap is reached. For those who’ve done something similar, what do you think is a fair split and cap?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I pay my CrossFit gym $15 a visit capped at 10 visits a week. Monthly the most I will ever pay is $600. But if I take a vacation for a week and see 60 visits the other 3 weeks, it’s technically only $450. I haven’t had that happen yet but that’s an option too

> **Response 2:** A percentage is only going to cut into your biggest asset that you need right now: revenue. Just counter with a flat rate and see what they say. No harm in asking for what you want.

Just an fyi to anyone that uses Square. I set up afterpay which allows 25% of the balance to be paid every 2 weeks. So it breaks the balance into 4 equal payments. One today… one in 2 weeks...one in 4 weeks and one in 6 weeks. Sooo $1000 would be $250x4. 0% interest to the customer.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How are you bypassing some of the processing fees here? Business Venmo doesn’t charge me to transfer to my bank account where square does. And Venmo seems to be less of an up front processing fee.

> **Response 2:** After pay is a higher percentage for the business though

What is everyone doing for a business phone? 

My husband and I own the business and we have several therapists and finally a front office person. We have been solely using his phone for business (was fine when we were smaller but since growth and front office we need something else). 

Do we buy another phone to add to our Verizon plan for the business line for our front office person to use? Perks to change our Verizon plan to a business plan? 

Other options? Cost effective options? 
Google voice…..but how does that work with front office person? 
Track phone?

I was approached by a local business owner of a well known PT clinic chain about inviting me to involved in his new business idea. He wants to put together a clinic site completely unrelated to his own clinics that would be modeled like a hair studio in that it would be a facility independent clinicians could rent space from individually. He is thinking to offer a la cart services like billing or scheduling and the independent providers would take or leave what they want and use space by time or client. This was a fast conversation. In the past I’ve been invited to work for him and I always said no thank you. He was not specific about my role. He just thought someone doing what I’m doing would be an asset to his idea. What is your reaction to this idea?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1st… Why have you always said “No thank you”?

> **Response 2:** I contracted like this is NYC, slightly different as the place didn’t have all the “stuff” I would have wanted/needed but it was awesome to have a space to work when I went in.  I paid per hour and would have paid more if there was more stuff I could use as well.  I know many clinicians that want to dabble on their own but space is an issue.  Could totally work in the right area I’m sure

This is kinda gross but also amazing. Someone dropped this kebab stick and within about 30 min it was swarming with tiny ants. 

We were fascinated watching them and realized that these tiny ants, working together towards a common goal, were able to move that stick.

I’m in the very very early stages of starting my own practice. A friend (think a little more than acquaintance) asked me to see her kiddo. We’ve had a couple of phone calls with mom debating if the kiddo needed to be seen. A few weeks later and I’m scheduled to see them Thursday. Mom mentioned that she wants to pay me to do this informal assessment. 

So here is the question: do I charge full price or provide a friend discount, especially considering I am JUST leaving my current job and going out on my own. No standardized tests etc. 

Thank you for any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d provide discount and ask if she’s pleased, if she would do a Google review, refer friends, etc.

> **Response 2:** You value yourself by the price you charge. Also, when people PAY, they PAY ATTENTION. During the height of C-vd I was giving away advice to friends who were pregnant and realized I resented them bc they weren't following through on my advice... but they had no investment so where was the incentive? Value yourself, and that yes you can help them. We teach people how to treat us and this is no different.

Has anyone done PT record reviews for an attorney for a legal case? What do you charge per hour? An ortho surgeon friend of mine referred me to a lawyer he does reviews for and the lawyer is asking me what my fee schedule is, I have no idea!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would personally charge whatever your hourly cash rate is.  Time is time regardless of what you're doing.

> **Response 2:** What I do is have a rate for the 1st 4 hours of document review with a 4 hour minimum I receive a check in advance for the initial review. 
2) 2nd rate for remaining review of documents, written report 3) 3rd rate - 1/2 day deposition rate
8hr day deposition 

4) 4th rate trial testimony. 
(1/2 day rate and full day rate)
All of this should be in an  email entitled legal fee.  I ask the attorney to return signed legal fee letter

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not telling you what to charge I’m just telling you that I am a licensed health insurance agent and I understand how reasonable and customary works and you can essentially take up to 140% of your Medicare physician fee schedule for your area and that would be the upper limit of what would be considered normal

> **Response 2:** Where are people finding patients willing to pay that much ?

Looking for advice from anyone here that has or is currently renting space inside a gym. 
I’m working on writing up a contract with a local gymnastics gym after treating some of their athletes. Gym is about 30,000 sq ft with about 500 members and 20 coaches. There’s no private space/office so I’d be setup either near the weights or in an open mat area with roughly 100-150 sq ft. It’s very flexible and seems like I can make what I want of it, so thinking of starting at 1-2 days per week for 4-6 hours and see how things evolve. Not sure if a daily, weekly, or monthly rent makes most sense to start with. Would love any insight or things to consider from those who have done something similar, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I started out inside of a gym I started with an hourly rate with a cap to convert to monthly once I hit a certain caseload. That way I could scale the rent as I grew. Happy to share more details if you want to PM me

> **Response 2:** Do you keep cash pay in the gym …
If yes … what’s the range you keep for cash pay …

Anyone offer a stretch lab kind of a service. We are planning to introduce something similar in our clinic. I would like to learn more. Do we need any special certifications? Our clientele is patients with neurologic deficits.
Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Shouldn’t be any other certs needed… I mean, you are a PT. 

We’ve not pulled the trigger yet on doing this, but I do recommend going to a few Stretch Lab, Stretch Zone, Stretch MD sessions first.  See what they really do. 

I did. Booked the free one. Bought a package. Went and enjoyed. Pay close attention to how they do it. Figure out how you could do it better.  Figure out how you can spend 25min hands on, without stopping and giving the client an exercise to do on their own. I actually gave the stretch practitioner feedback for hand placement… they were doing good but needed some refinement. 

Actually liked it enough that I looked into buying a franchise, but had my reasons and ended up not doing it. It truly wasn’t that expensive. 

BUT one of the things….

Each visit is going to cost you b/w $30-$50 (package vs pay per visit). Great. That isn’t bad. 

But on the other end, that person is going to come to you and pay you $30 to $50. Which is a copay. Which kind of sucks. 

Now…I know this is an uncaged thing… if you bill their insurance because they’re coming to you for a back or neck issue… we’re talking much different money. A 23-25 minute stretch session billed as Neuro ReEd AND get the copay. 

So you market it this way….”why go to a stretchy place and get stretched by a guy who spent a weekend in Lauderdale learning how to do this, when you can come to me —who did 8 years of school learning it— AND I can give you a couple of exercises to do at home as well. And if the stretching isn’t just exactly what you need…I can get more in depth. Maybe some dry needles. Maybe a quick crack. maybe a couple of strengthening things as well.”

> **Response 2:** Somebody has to say it, so I'll be that guy. I would hope we would use our education as PTs to rid the world of this nonsense. Neat for a feel-good treatment, but not for people seeking an evidence-based answer to their pain. I get that there's a market for it and money to be made, but it feels cheap to me and is harmful to the identity of our profession. If anyone is out there providing stand alone stretching as a service, they better not be asking why people don't understand what PTs do and what our education level is.

So I interviewed for a position at a facility that will be opening in June.  This was back in February. It is a business man who son is in PT school and wanted to start a practice for him. They wanted a therapist to help get practice going as well as cont to work. As they were going through the process they told me in order to open it on time the practice needed to be owned by a PT in NJ. So they said if I wanted to they could put my name on the LLC and transfer it to the son once he passes his boards. We are still waiting for attorney to do all the paperwork work but wanted some idea if this was an issue. I’ll be paid salary vs 1099   We have an EMR amd equipment. Need to start marketing to physicians in area. As of now not a lot of PT places in area. It’s will be Medicare amd OON only. Any specific questions I should be asking g or looking for in this paper work

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** why are yall worried about lawsuits ??

> **Response 2:** If you own it. You have the liability.  
In order for you to sell it to him money should likely exchange hands of sorts. 

After all they are truly renting your license and you should see it as such. 
If not a sale I would be asking for an ownership portion and get some of that equity. 

Many business people focus on profits and not patient care etc.  be mindful of that. 

This father likely sees $$$ 

Either way you need a good exit package plan in place.  

If it’s a no from them it should also be a no from you.

Need some advice:
I have a mobile PT business where I see patients for self pay or through Med Part B.
Had a Chiropractor, who is an aquatence of my husband, ask to set up a deal with me to come into his office to see, primarily, Medicare patients bc he isn't a Medicare provider (he says he has tons of patients to give me...). He was talking about partnering together or me paying him part of the profit or rent. I really dont know what to say. I dont want to blow off a potential business deal/connection but not sure the legal aspect or how we'd bill (through my mobile company or his brick and mortar) This is all new to me as I have only been doing this a little over 1 year (but have been a PT for 14 and a manager of clinic for 12 of those years). Anyone who made similar partnerships or business deals can lead me in the right direction or give advice? I am in FL if that helps.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would question “partnering” in every sense of the word. I would treat it like you are renting a room or a space and keep your own business private. Paying rent is legal, giving him part of that is not. ￼

> **Response 2:** Paying him a piece of the profit is a kick back and is illegal!  He wants to pump up his Medicare revenue using you.

Food for thought. 

You get home from work and realize you are locked out of your house. You call a locksmith. They come out and within three minutes. You are inside. They charge you $100. 

￼ same scenario ..it takes them 30 minutes to get you inside your house. They charge you $100. Which scenario do you like better? 

The average person will pay 50% more to wait 50% less   🫠💯✅￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The problem with these comparisons is that forever, we as therapists are in a health care system that has paid for services with insurance. 
Trainers and acupuncturists and massage therapists have never been part of the insurance system. It will take a long time and much persistence and change for us to be seen differently….people pay a lot for their insurance every month and want to use it when they can. It’s a tough position to be in but it’s where we are as therapists.

> **Response 2:** Also, an average locksmith should get you in the house in 1 visit. Even great PT will/should often take multiple visits for the problem to truly be solved.

I have owned my own LLC since February and am currently still working part time at an OP clinic. At the OP clinic, we do not have a receptionist and it falls on the therapists to answer phones, schedule patients, do patient intake, open up the clinic, etc. Since opening my own business and reducing my hours, my boss has been criticizing me for clocking in 10-15 minutes early to do the tasks above. My thinking is that this is the cost of not having a receptionist and I can’t be expected to do these tasks for free. Any insight would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think your boss needs to consider who is supposed to be paid to open the clinic 15 min early so clients dont' arrive to a locked door. If they want someone else to do it they can schedule them and let you know that you shouldn't. If they want you to do it, you can't legally work off the clock.

> **Response 2:** I totally agree you should be paid for those extra tasks. I would have a convo with the boss and say you wouldn’t mind helping out but will be paid for that time or else you will be arriving right as the session starts and leaving we soon as it is over.

Question for PTs that offer in person strength training - are your prices the same for that as for a PT session? Assuming the time of the session is the same.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. I have offered to do groups of high school up 3 kiddos and they just split the cost of the time rate. For adults, I still charge the rate for cash PT for my time.

> **Response 2:** Same price for all the reasons above, plus… if you start out charging a lower rate for personal training and then the client needs more of a physical therapy visit… It’s hard to go up on the price. ￼

Hi all!  I’m currently running a cash based practice and considering credentialling with Medicare.   For those of you that have done so (preferably in the Virginia area) can you give me some insight into your reimbursement rates?  I can look up the fee schedule online but I realize this just gives me base numbers for each CPT code and that there are a lot of variables to this.  Trying to decide if it’s worth the hassle or not!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** AOTA has a calculator in their site that will take the deduction into account. I would use that if you are an OT. https://www.aota.org/practice/practice-essentials/coding/medicare-fee-schedule-calculator I suspect that APTA has the same for PT.

> **Response 2:** I just took the leap and did it this spring. I’m in MD, but I believe VA uses the same MAC (don’t quote me on that.) I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn’t as much of a hassle as I expected. I was credentialed very quickly, and the people at Novitas were very pleasant and helpful. My EMR takes care of all the submissions of claims and accounting without increasing my rate because I’m a solo practice and they are a small company. My business has doubled in revenue because I’m getting double what I was taking for “non-skilled wellness” visits. I don’t get what I get for cash clients, but it’s a reliable stream of income at about 80% of what my cash rate is, which is still great.

Lawyer has reached out for documentation and had a medical release form signed by client.

I have heard that you can send an invoice and charge the law firm.

How much and how do you go about doing this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use our state’s normal rates for copies, faxes, admin fees, etc. I ask chatGPT to add them all up and put in an invoice.

> **Response 2:** Ryan Friend … you CAN charge for your time to gather and send. Lawyers certainly do.  You can tell them that you have a $XX.xx charge for that 

You could give them documentation that lists the dates you saw the client and what was charged each time (should be the same charges unless you do a different charge for eval.).

What’s the going rate for cash based pelvic PT in Los Angeles? Someone I know is being charged $250 per visit. Is that reasonable?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The only person who can deem it reasonable or not is the patient/client. Does he/she feel that what they are receiving is worth the rate they're paying? Because we all value things differently, and see that value from different points of view.

My rates are well above the rates of anyone else in my area. But every one of my clients are convinced that what they receive is well worth every penny they spent. Does the fact that my rates are higher than anyone else around me mean that my rates are unreasonable? People who choose not to work with me probably think so. People who do choose to work with me often feel I am undervaluing my services. The eye of the beholder is a powerful thing.

> **Response 2:** That’s within average rates for pelvic PTs in this area. But I also think this post has an undertone of judgment about someone else’s rates. As Joe said above, the only person who can deem it reasonable is the patient/client. If they feel the service is valuable at that rate, they will pay it. If they don’t, they won’t. There’s room in the market for different levels of service priced at different rates.

For those who opened a physical location. 
I just signed a lease with my landlord, he’s asking for financial statements, I’m a start up business so I don’t know what is expected as far financial statements. Can someone shed some light? I asked my accountant and he said “you wouldn’t have P/L because you haven’t started operating” .

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is very common and seems standard practice. They want to determine if you have the ability to personally guarantee the lease. If you told them you are a start up I wouldn’t think they would have an expectation. As suggested above, provide a pro forma. List assets you have: equipment, home, etc. List what you have in your savings accounts as well. This seemed to start happening recently. I personally do not like this practice! I don’t like giving up personal information. However, they might not lease you space unless you do. 🤷🏻‍♂️

> **Response 2:** Was part of the terms of the lease in writing that you provided financial statements?  I wouldn’t think he needs to see your financial statements especially if it’s something that he’s just added on that he wants after you signed.

**Original Post:**
Is anyone willing to share their single visit rate vs package rate and how they went about deciding if packages were a good idea?   Currently I don’t offer packages but considering it as a way to offer a more affordable option to those who need it.   Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did primarily packages for about a year and now have switched to $150/session. Honestly has just been better all around with everyone paying the same rate and losing less in discounts all over the place. I do offer paid in full options for anyone who wants nothing to do with Superbills/insurance and just wants to pay in full for 12 sessions. Those are 10% off but I rarely use those now

> **Response 2:** The rates people are sharing will fluctuate depending on location, specialty, and if mobile/concierge. Consider a sales tactic called price anchoring where you have a significantly higher single session rate and packages that seem like a great discount. This pushes people to get the package, which leads to more money upfront and commitment from the patient's end to complete the POC. Individual sessions can lead to drop off/no show when the patient stops seeing the value or if there isnt an immediate change

Thinking of PromptEMR (with billing), quickbooks (duh), and Gusto for Payroll. Does the cost of Prompt and its add ons make up for its higher cost? They make it sound like it’s pretty failsafe for billing compliance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use prompt with integrated srfax. For 1 PT and part time OT the cost runs to 650. I don't think it is cost effective.

> **Response 2:** We love prompt, if the team is utitlizing correctly and is trained on automations and features its well worth it and you should see a support staff reduction that should easily offset cost difference (depending on your team size of course). We used gusto for a few years and loved it, but eventually outgrew it. Just did not cover all our needs with multiple clinics

Hi all, looking to build out my pilates wellness program at my private physical therapy practice in Evanston, IL. Currently myself (I'm a PT) and 2 colleagues (one is a PT, one a PTA) do wellness sessions, but I am CONSTANTLY getting new requests and my existing people are saturated. Any leads on someone in the northshore Chicago area (a PT or an experienced pilates instructor) that are looking for more work would be appreciated! And I pay very well!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you mind me asking who you did your pilates training through? I’ve been looking into it because I love it for my own fitness and think it’s such a great transition for patients who graduate PT 😊

> **Response 2:** Elsa Gould would love to learn more about how you setup pilates cash pay vs insurance based PT.  Would love to get away from insurance entirely

I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with a lawyer who I suspect might as me to travel for a deposition. She asked me to send my fee, which I really want to get right in case I'm billing for a lot more hours. My gut said to just bill what I do for patients because my time is my time, but I scrolled through some old threads and see that people are charging a LOT more. What's the justification/ how do I know what to charge here?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I met a PT randomly who was asked to be an expert witness of sorts. He didn’t want to do it so quoted the attorney 1200/hr with 4 hr minimum.

They paid him upfront.

> **Response 2:** I’ve charged $400/hr, based on what I found as “the norm”. 
Also, be specific in you fee schedule to include that you get paid for time scheduled, even if they have to reschedule it. 

(I was subpoenaed to give a deposition on a case as a witness/expert, and had to take a day off from work, to do it, and they cancelled it 1 hour before I was scheduled to be there)

I currently do PT contract work  through my mobile PT LLC for a home health agency to round out my schedule, maintain predictable income, and through whom I often get a lot of referrals  when people are not home health appropriate etc. the company recently sold and is going from hourly contracted rate to per visit contracted rate. I will obviously need to re negotiate my contract but would like to have an idea of a pay range for per visit home health rate so that I can negotiate proactively. Anyone have experience with this? Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in North Texas… rates directly to agency for me are $100 for eval/reeval/dc and $80 for routine. I don’t do SOC for the one agency I work with directly but I do them for 2 contract groups. Ranges from $110-140 depending on which group and where the patient is.

Nice to have flexibility to simply say no when I want. If they are desperate for help, they have no choice but to pay. I wouldn’t take less than $140 for SOCs in your situation. I know of one PT getting $180 for an SOC in rural Mississippi. You have to account for your non billed time driving which is going to be higher in rural automatically.

> **Response 2:** I do the same and am paid per visit. Where do you live? I’m in Texas, and it will greatly vary from state to state (I.e. California rates are way higher), but I get paid 80-90 a visit on average for all visits. I do not do SOC visits. Just eval, RE, treat, DC! Been considering asking for a slight pay bump here recently to 90+ per visit. I’ll see if that goes over well lol! Greatly helps me do all of the above you mention being a PRN home health PT.

I currently have a pt that is being seen though insurance. There is a $30 copay per visit that my company has to charge.  The family is not able to afford the co-pay and is needing to step down therapy.  Is there a legal way for my company to continue treatment without billing for the copay?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Billing doesn’t mean collecting

> **Response 2:** Company can offer a payment plan to pay off the balance. But what bother me in this situations, that asking not to pay a co-pay or deductable really means asking the company owners to pay for their therapy. The same people who ask to not pay co-pays and  stating that it is too much for them , go and have nails done every two weeks or eat out weekly (or more often), etc. When a plumber comes and fixes something in 10 min and charges much more than $30  people pay and do not say anything. But for some reason when it comes to therapy, people do not want to pay. People pay enormous amount of money to veterinarians and usually it is all cash. It is all about the perceived value....Therapists are already underpaid professionals. And if we do not value our services, no one will. The reimbursement for our services is going down. A lot of times these $30 is the make or break for the company . Or it is what allows a company to pay our salaries. Please note, I am not an owner of any company.

**Original Post:**
Had a meeting with a large primary care practice (over 3,000 patients). They had a PT clinic in these 2 rooms for over 5 years and that practice led to open their own space elsewhere. They want me to sublease the space (the price seems quite high to me at $2k/month for these 2 teeny rooms). 

My thought is to offer a PT being on site 1 afternoon per week to see referrals as walk ins for screens and could schedule follow up's for that time at a fraction of that rent or maybe a % of revenue. 

I have owned my practice for over 10 years and am 75% mobile and have another much larger brick and mortar clinic on the other side of town at which I see patients 2 days per week. 

I love the idea of getting into primary care but not sure this is a good fit. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have 5 rooms in my office and the rent is $4350/month I live in Fort Worth Tx. The goal is to hire MT to work with me. But while I'm building my business I have other people renting the other offices (laser hair removal, Functional Med Nurse practiciner, esthetician, infrared sauna room, and bodywork) one day a week I have some one renting my office too. What I don't have is 3000 potential clients walking past my office.  That seems like a deal to me.  What are the lease terms? Could you split the lease with another PT that is specialized in something different than you, like Pelvic Floor PT. That way your not fighting over the same type of clients and or hire a PT PRN.  At the end of the day you want to enjoy the space your in and it to be functional.

Questions for starting a mobile practice! Just getting started (not seeing patients yet, just getting biz side organized) and new to all this, sorry if these are repetitive, have searched multiple groups and am looking for some more clear answers than what I have found. TIA! :D
1. DBA vs LLC? Was recommended by an attorney and an accountant to start with just DBA to reduce initial overhead and annual costs until I have a steady revenue stream. Pros/cons of either? I have looked into this extensively but having a hard time finding specifics aside from the liability and assets. I also read that my SSN would be put on superbills if I did not set up an LLC with a separate EIN? Is this true or are there ways around putting your SSN on superbills?
1. Direct access limitations: if there is a limitation on how long we can treat (90 day direct access), how do you contact physician at end of 90 days? With a plan of care and get their signature? Does this mean that whatever EMR system I choose should be set-up to fax? I was going with Jane App but saw that someone said they aren't set up to fax?
1. Do I need to go into Proview and update all my personal information, license renewel, etc? It was previously filled out by my former employer. Is this only if I plan to accept insurance (I don't)? 
1. NPI type I or II? I plan to be strictly cash based with option to provide superbill.
1. Is business coaching worth it? I know I probably need it, but I ended up having to quit my job because my childcare fell through, so I do not currently have a reliable paycheck and want to keep costs low. Are their any coaching or mentorship programs that are less than $1000 that people have found worth it? Thank you all so much!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** LLC will protect your personal assets. It separates your personal from business and it doesn’t cost much to do vs liability.

> **Response 2:** In MI a DBA is under an LLC?

Does anyone have a yearly membership or retainer program? I’d love to chat and see what that looks like. I have a client that calls me when she travels and gets dizzy. She gets recurrent dizzy spells and needs help navigating her symptoms. I also see her in person when she is in state. So between phone calls, virtual sessions, check ins, home exercises, and in person sessions I’m wondering if I could put some kind of package together that she could put me on retainer( and what people are charging for something like this)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A membership program has been on my to do list 1.5 years. Would love to hear what others are doing.

> **Response 2:** I've spoken with several MDs, Chiros, and PTs who have done this. The over arching theme has been that you make money from having a lot of members and not by charging a lot. You still have to charge a good amount. $100/month is $1200 a year and if you have 100 members, it adds up. 
I have not started a program yet though so don't follow my advice. I am still running numbers so that I don't over promise and under deliver or get bogged down.

I spoke to a contract company that contracts with a local ALF. I asked for $70 /hr for a PT independent contractor position. Did I low ball myself? There full time W2 rate is $55? Thoughts please, thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are they supplying you with patients and taking care of your EMR? Are they responsible for cancellations and no-shows? Before signing anything I would definitely ask some more practical situation type questions. Are you making your own hours? How much are they getting reimbursed if it’s $150 then you’re getting less than half and doing all the work.

> **Response 2:** I think it depends on a lot of things. How many clients you have to see, how many and, etc. If you know your cost per visit or hour, then you can use that to help decide how much money you’ll be making

Posted this in another group and got no traction so hoping you guys might have some insight. Sorry to those where it’s crossposted…..

Had a random thought about overall payment structure. I know many offer discounts for bulk purchase of sessions, and some offer monthly subscription services. However, has anyone ever successfully implemented extended payment plans to overcome the upfront cost in low-income areas? 

I know there are a handful of quite successful cash-based practitioners in my area that are crushing it (Love seeing your success Russ, Sean, Mike, Derek), but they are all based in more affluent neighborhoods of the region. While I ended up taking an insurance based position when I moved for stability while I focused my energies on growing my online services, current familial and clinical ownership changes might be re-invigorating the drive to get out of the mill and I’m thinking through potential hurdles as I rebuild the business plan.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Another option is to bill out of network instead of being strictly cash based. It’s a little bit tricky at first because you have to find out which plans are worth submitting vs just collecting your cash rate up front and having the patient submit a superbill on their own, but if you can figure out which ones are worth it, you will likely get paid more than your discounted package rate.

> **Response 2:** I’ve done a payment plans for splitting the package into a maximum of 3 payments spread out throughout the plan of care with the last payment having to be paid before the last session. I have never done extended payment plans beyond the plan of care.

What is the best way to go about selling your business? There is a good chance that my husband is getting relocated and I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I'd really hate to just have to scrap everything I've worked for and pass my patients off to a different clinic.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Tough, sole practitioner are tough to sell, cuz your patients like you. Start immediately, call every therapist you know and sell them on the idea of being there own boss and the financial benefits. Be honest and open. Make it a win -win. Someone wants to be in your shoes, GL

> **Response 2:** Is there any chance you can hire a PT and continue to operate the business from another state? You would do all the admin work and the therapist would see the patients. You would likely earn more from operating the business like this for a couple years instead of selling

Hey!

For those of your with brick and mortar clinics, I figured a shopping list to get more folks lifting more weights in person might be helpful.

Is there any way to offer cash pay services to someone that has Medicare? To my understanding this is not allowed but is there a way around this? I currently have a total knee patient that would like to pay cash.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If the person needs skilled therapy (ie post op care from TKR) you can’t just get around it by calling it wellness. You can only charge cash for non covered services.

> **Response 2:** Unfortunately no but you could always convert them into a wellness client once PT is done. I've done that with a lot of my patients. 

I think it's awesome that so many clinicians on here are cash based. But I'm amazed that someone would pay cash pay for post-op total knee rehab when insurance covers it. I feel like most PTs do a pretty good job in this area

I would love to hear from cash therapists in small rural towns NOT in California or states with higher income.

I am in rural SC, town with no more than 30k people, 1.5hs from bigger city, average household income of $55k.

I run a great successful insurance practice with 1-1 individual high level care, high success rate, but can only see so many a week and I can make same income working less doing home health. 

I am basically working more and making less just so I can choose my own PTO. 

Pelvic floor - I’d need to charge at least 162 to make budget 

Ps if you are insurance based or feel cash based don’t work in small areas this is not the post. I want to see who made and succeeded

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are TONS of cash practices in rural areas that thrive. I’m still building my practice, but I was able to replace my income from both my full-time insurance job and my PRN acute care job by seeing 8 patients/week. If you’re thinking of starting your own cash based pelvic practice, recommend Pelvic PT/OT Entrepreneurs group and looking into the Pelvic PT Rising mentorship programs because they are a total game changer.

2 Questions for clinicians (I’m a PT) in Illinois:

1) Do we need an LLC or a PLLC? Planning for a single clinician PT practice. Follow up question: for the form you have to complete, if it’s a mobile practice can you just put your home address in?
2) Does anyone have recent fee schedules for commercial insurances for IL they can share with me? Trying to decide who (if any) to accept 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** mobile PT in IL: PLLC for sure (i did LLC and had to pay to switch). dunno about fee schedule, i'm self pay or hsa/fsa.

> **Response 2:** PLLC and not sure about the fee schedule, I'm currently cash pay.

> **Response 1:** Ahhhh!! I got one of these about seeing 8 tennis players. Kept asking questions and they stopped responding 😝

> **Response 2:** Interesting. I did have one family in an affluent development and they had 6 cash pay family members wanting PT. I was definitely skeptical but it was legit. Had a credit card on file and a very happy PT indecent contractor!

**Are there any physical therapists in South Jersey interested in partnering to open a clinic?**

I’m looking for **two more entrepreneurial-minded physical therapists**  to join me and my partner (another PT) in launching a new outpatient clinic (with plans to expand into multiple locations).

If we collaborate and combine our resources, we can build a truly therapist-driven practice and compete effectively against large corporate and private-equity groups.

If you’re motivated, business-minded, and looking to build something long-term, let’s connect.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am in Atlantic County

Not PT related, and not looking for medical advice. Just a general question: is shin pain common with growing pains? My oldest son will be 10 in Aug, and is on the small side so I’m expecting a growth spurt soon. He’s very active and pretty much never complains about pain, but was in tears this morning telling me he’s had shin pain for “weeks”. Apparently it’s inconsistent, not worse at night or with activity. I never had growing pains, so I have no idea, and I always have an underlying and probably unreasonable fear of osteosarcoma.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Could be shin splints.  I had that as a teen.  Horrible pain.  There is taping to help try YouTube and see if that helps

> **Response 2:** My son had horrible growing pains. His dad also had Osgood -Schlatters in his middle school years and had horrible pains. Might look into a cho-pat brace to wear with activities, it might offer some relief. Always good to have him checked out.

It feels like nearly half of the posts in this group are about how to get new patients

Why not turn to the people who already **trust** you, have already seen **results** and have already given you **money**, and increase their lifetime revenue?

Tomorrow night (May 11 at 8pm EST) CJ and I are going to hosting a workshop all about how to do exactly that

How to avoid that thing you hate, **selling**, and just extend the value you are already providing to your people

It takes less time out of your schedule than you think, and once you realize the amount of money it can bring to your practice, you'll be excited to get started!

Follow the link below to sign up!

**Original Post:**
For those who run their PT practices out of other businesses like gyms, wellness facilities, chiropractic offices, etc,. what should I expect to pay to rent or lease space on a monthly basis? This would be very part time to begin - less than 15 hours per week. I know this will vary by location, but wanting some averages to go off of for negotiations.

Edited to add: this will be in the Midwest near Kansas City, MO. And a shared space not my own.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** RE is so location dependent that your best bet is to find out the local per sq foot rate is and go from there.

> **Response 2:** Another thing to consider is will the space be completely yours? So can you leave marketing materials up in the common area even when you are not there? Or is it a shared space that you will only be renting hourly/as needed? 

I recommend trying to negotiate an hourly rate or fixed lease amount instead of paying a percent of what you are making… the country club I rent from wanted me to do 70/30 with them but I asked for a fixed amount and they agreed to $650/month. I’m in California so this was very reasonable. I’m now making 8-10k a month so I definitely got the better end of the deal by not agreeing to go 70/30

Mobile PT providers: For Part B MCR do they HAVE to be seen in their home location or can they be seen for services at a location of their choice? For instance a gym they belong to, another location other than their specific home if their home isn't conducive for PT and they want to use you as their PT and not go to an actual Clinic, etc....

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They must be seen in their home for Medicare to cover the service.

> **Response 2:** Has to be their home or a clinic for Medicare to cover it.

Anywhere else is not a covered service. (Meaning you can charge your cash rate.)

I have a tax question. I have an LLC. I was told to file as an S-corp to maximize the tax benefit. Does anyone have any insight on this issue?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just met with accountant and learned a lot about this. Kicker is you must do payroll and have to pay yourself a “reasonable wage”. have to be much more tedious with book-keeping. If you file as S-corp, can’t go “backwards” to LLC but as LLC you can change to S-corp at anytime. As a newbie, I’m gonna stay LLC to keep it simple but if I ever have employees, will likely change to S-corp.

> **Response 2:** I was told that too everyone does that though wen they first start out u can always change it next year but supposedly more tax breaks and benefits... if u make under 40k a year they say it's better to be an LLC though

Does anyone know if you can see client with Medicaid for cash pay in Missouri. I am a pelvic floor PT and She is willing to pay the cash pay rate. I cannot find a Missouri Medicaid number where I can actually talk to a specific person.  All the numbers I call on their website are automated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't think PT is a covered benefit for adults via MO HealthNet. If not covered, yes, you can.

> **Response 2:** I finally got a hold of someone at Medicaid and in Missouri you can see patients with Medicaid in a cash based practice if they sign a document saying they are not using insurance and will pay fee for service.

Hello,

I have an opportunity to work in a gym but they suggested they would like me to bill through them which I said no to. I have a meeting with them next week and want to negotiate pricing/terms. Any suggestions or recommendations would be appreciated. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Tell them you can’t do a percentage or fee per client with them because of anti-kickback laws that could make it seem like they are referring people to you just to increase their profit rather than for the benefit of the client. 

Then pitch a sliding scale or flat rate rent that increases over time as you get established, with a cap.

> **Response 2:** I would suggest pushing to just pay a rental fee, otherwise that it would make it very complicated for your business moving forward if you ever went separate ways

I approached a community center to use a portion of their pool to see patients for aquatic therapy. They are asking for 30% of revenue.
1) is this legal in healthcare, to pay a portion of revenue, especially if any of their members were to come to me for treatment?
2) is it just me or is 30% ridiculously high?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 30% is fairly standard. 20-40% is normal range, but can go to 50/50 even depending on what's included etc.

> **Response 2:** It can depend on your state. In some places it's not legal for them to charge you more than what would be considered a reasonable lease rate, in those states a percentage could get the facility in trouble. Some places charge providers a flat fee per hour with a monthly capped charge.

Hi everyone!
I have a question about starting a wellness/fitness service (that does NOT offer PT services) while holding a PT license.
What do I need to do to cover myself in terms of liability? Also, I'm in CA.... What's the deal with LLCs? Do I need to do something else to formally start a coaching business?

More details: after many years of thinking about it (and getting amazing inspiration from this group!) I've decided to take the leap and start a coaching service that focuses on fitness/wellness/mindfulness, is cash based, and not through the healthcare system (not treating injuries, illness, no MD referrals, or taking insurance)
In the meantime I'm still working in acute care (in the ICU and with transplants- completely different vibe 😅) and will continue for the foreseeable future.
 Over the past couple years I became a certified health coach, and have taken courses in nutrition, strength training, cardiovascular fitness and mindfulness (in addition to all the coursework I did in undergrad and grad school that applies to wellness). I feel like I'm qualified (maybe over qualified!) to provide coaching services but for some reason I'm terrified to start.

I just want to make sure I don't get in trouble with the PT board or into liability issues just because I hold a PT license... From this page, I see some of you provide wellness/non PT services that are separate from your PT practice. I need your wisdom! 🙏 

Thank you for reading this far and for your time! Again, this community has been a huge inspiration, I've been "lurking" for years but too afraid to jump into the conversation until now. Hello, finally!! 🙋🏽‍♀️☺️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t know the laws in CA, but I could pretty much guarantee there are people with way less qualifications providing the service you’re describing. You’ll always be a PT, but as long as you aren’t performing PT I think you’re probably good to go. Of course, if I’m wrong, someone please correct me!

> **Response 2:** You must establish yourself as a legal business entity in your state.  Your Secretary of State determines this and the info is usually on their website or call them.  Then you need to be aware of local and county business laws.  Then ask your CPA which business entity is best for your business goals.

We need to take into account that great achievement involves great risk.

It pains me to see so many people with such incredible dreams — impactful, game-changing, earth-shattering dreams — then to see that there is an unwillingness to take ANY risk to go after that dream. 

It breaks my heart. Because those dreams…where did they come from? What if that is your true calling in life?

What pains me is people who are not willing to take the risk but then you ARE willing to spend everyday questioning whether or not you are actually living up to your full potential. That’s not living, that’s living in agony. 

Our callings don’t leave us. They will always stay at our proverbial “house”, and continue to knock at the door just waiting to be let in.

Some of us aren’t even willing to open the door. To take a risk in any way. But we all know deep down inside that the only way to make that dream happen is by taking a risk and believing in yourself. 

Open the door. 🚪

Does anybody provide a service where you can hold my hand through finishing my set up for my cash pay/wellness/Luna-based patient business? (PT in CALIFORNIA)

Currently I have my s corporation, business license, and ive taken some wellness patients so far and have also contracted with home health companies through my business. 

What I need help with is ensuring I have the right waivers, know how to send super bills, what to do after the 12th PT visit via direct access (cash pay), picking a simple EMR system, setting up electronic payments, and anything else I may be missing!

I have a friend who is going to develop/design my website for free  but at some point I would like to have scheduling embedded in there (they might be able to help with that).

Let me know what you would charge to help with this!

My goal is to work 4 days a week via W2 job and then see patients 2 days a week from my business. Plus i would perform tasks during the entire week related to virtual coaching/PT that isn't face to face and other business related tasks.

How much percentage raise did you get once you opened your own practice? Thanks in advance for sharing.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Very tough question to answer for several reasons. 

Initially my pay decreased because of the building phase. I now limit the number of visits I do per week for better work life balance so I can have tike to focus on my family, mentoring, teaching, other business endeavors, etc. For me money wasn't and isn't everything. 

Better to think about what you want to make and/or comfortable making and what it will take for you to get to that point. Consider things such as expenses and taxes that you'll have to pay when looking at what you will actually take home.

> **Response 2:** My phrase for a long time now: ‘my boss is super flexible, but the pay is terrible’ lol

I am planning a 10% rate increase for 2023.  I was hoping to keep my consistent/regular clients at the old rate but only begin charging new clients the increased rate, that way I don't need to *announce* a rate change.  Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Call me.  Lessons learned…

> **Response 2:** I saw someone who offered current patients an option to pay for as many visits as they want up front at the current rate or continuing paying for each visit at the new rate. I liked that idea. Gave patients a choice without you losing money by keeping some people at the lower price.

I don’t want to sell the profession short and I’m a strong believer in charging appropriately so that our profession is respected. Also if someone charges super low it makes it harder for others to justify their higher prices. 

So regarding that…. What does everyone charge? Upstate New York area.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not in NY- I’m in suburbs of GA. I charge 175 treatment and 225 eval. 

But around me I have seen as low as 100/visits and high as 300/visit.

> **Response 2:** Never realized there were so many of us in the Upstate area. I moved back just south of Rochester in ‘21 after a few years away. My own business model now is all remote consulting and coaching but I was charging $150.00 for an hour session treat or eval.

Hi! A few questions!!

1) I am in Texas! Someone in texas doing mobile PT? Is it preferred to go LLC or sole prop route?? I am new at this so I don’t know much of the difference? Did u go the lawyer route? Or online routine to register business?

2) once i do that, do i need to register my business somewhere else??? Like the state?? Or the LLC/sole prop covers that? 

2) For business checking accounts, For the Business tax identification number, do I get that whenever I make my business LLC Or sole prop? Or where do I get that number?

3) another one for business checking accounts…where do I obtain the “Articles of Organization” or “Certification of Formation” of my business?

4) any banks you recommend for business account?

Thank u!!!!!!!!!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi I am from Texas, you can ask your accountant to do it for you or you can do it yourself.

> **Response 2:** David Bayliff and Josh Payne have a great starting guide and Josh lives in Texas

Anybody deal with patients with using HSA card to pay for services being charged as cash pay patients. Then the patient submitted the super bill to insurance , UHC manages this self payor ( NBA league). Now my patient wants notes and I gave them everything and now UHC denied like 8 visits for not having specific exercises listed in the daily notes (basically crap reason). In order to reconsider UHC want all these extra notes but not sure if I want to comply. My question is Can the HSA debit card charge back the money. And secondly hopefully the patient doesn't have to pay it. I loathe UHC! Getting out of network with them, ASAP.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is the exact reason why you are cash pay for UHC. The patient agreed to be responsible and head to face what insurance plan they bought. If they want additional daily notes you can't keep those from patients but if they want appeals and other things you do not need to comply

> **Response 2:** So the client is trying to get reimbursed by their HSA and UHC? I’m confused.

When applying for a new job, can the new employer see or have access to previous salary. I’m leaving my current employer to go to a clinic where in my interview they mentioned I would qualify for up to $15 per hour more. ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They can call your old employer and ask for salary, but they may not do that, and your old employer may not give them the information even if they ask.  That would be the only way for them to get that info.  There are a lot of "what if's" in that scenario.

But my question is-- why do you care if they know?  It's irrelavent what you made before.  If the new employer is offering to pay more, and/or your old employer was underpaying you, that's obviously why you want to leave (and a very good reason to leave at that).  The only numbers that are important here are the standard/average pay for a therapist with your education and experience in your area, and the cost of living in your area.  Demand what you're worth, and don't let them dictate that to you!

> **Response 2:** tell them you were making $150/hr

Hi all! SLP here. I put in my notice to be done in June. I plan on working on the logistics for the summer and hitting the ground running with my own practice in the fall. 

One of the things I’m struggling with is the private pay structure - 100%, I’m not dealing with insurance but I also want to find a way to service the people who are not able to private pay. Isn’t private pay only sustainable to the few (client, wise?). TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Private pay is sustainable but, as with most things in the therapy world, it depends. It depends on your clientele, skill set, niche, etc. 

Not all insurances are hard to deal with and not all insurances are bad. You can pick and choose how you work with what insurances and when. 

There are plenty of options to fit you, your practice and your patients. 

Good luck! And congrats!

> **Response 2:** Private pay is possible for those who value your service. I've had patients tell me that they rather use their insurance and could not afford to pay OOP and then contact me a few weeks later asking to schedule. If the service you provide is of value, then people will pay for the care they need and deserve.

Hi all! Do superbills need to be broken down by cost per CPT code or is the total charge of all CPT codes sufficient? Example (for simple math) 
Option 1:
2 units 97110 = $50
2 units 97112 = $50 
total = $100

Option 2 (can it just be listed?) 
2 units 97110
2 units 97112
total = $100

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your CPT codes do not need to equal the cost off the visit. You can charge $70 per CPT code and cahrge a flat fee of $150. Insurance will reimbure the patient based on $150 but the data will be input for CPT codes in your area at $70 per unit

> **Response 2:** I've heard of people charging a certain rate per unit that will equal higher than the cash pay rate, then adding another line item to bring the rate down to the cash pay rate. IE if your cash pay rate was $250...
 1 unit Therex $100
1 unit manual $100
1 unit therapy $100
Provider Discount -$50.

I have started doing cash based PT at a local gym. I am paying the gym owner $20/visit, with max of $1200/month for therapy visits. We have not discussed smaller costs per sessions such as $50 dry needling sessions. Wanting advice on how to go about talking to gym owner about lower cost sessions. Obviously I don't want to pay $20 of my $50 session. Any advice would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Logan I definitely wouldn’t do a percentage split because then they’ll know how much you make and most likely will try to raise your rent. I like others ideas of charging by the hour as long as you can keep your cap and you can always raise your rates

> **Response 2:** I wouldn’t do per session but per hour. That way if you have a shorter session like 30 min needling session it would only be $10 vs $20. Also consider raising your rates. I pay $25 an hour for a similar situation.

A question I'm pondering.
Do you build your business with legacy in mind?
IE: what happens to the business after I'm gone? Who will take over the reins? Can it go on without me?
OR
Do you build your business with an exit strategy?
IE: build it to a certain point then sell it?
OR
Do you just build it to serve you now and enjoy the ride?
If this one....what might the complications of closing the business look like that could be prepared for now?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1. Legacy is always in my mind. What footprint am I leaving for me, family and the population I serve.

2. I always have an exit strategy. I've sold my businesses back home in the Philippines. My daughters are taking over my business once they are done with PTA or otr np school. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** This is such a personal decision based on so many factors! I am three years in and I don’t have a definite plan, although I do make decisions with the thought in mind to potentially eventually sell the business, but you never know. If the business is providing for me financially, and it’s not causing a lot of stress than there may be no reason to sell it. if one of my adult children wants to take it over at some point then that might be the answer. At this point, just trying to build and grow and not make the decision right away. ￼

I need your advice. I am contemplating a lot lately to be an independent contractor but I am afraid to fail as I am the breadwinner.  I have a daughter going into College and my husband’s salary mostly goes to his student debt and expenses. I am afraid to give up my full time job but I am also tired of the high taxes. 

Im still looking into opening up my own business, is LLC or Scorp better? How did you turn your businesses into the full time and how long did it take you? 

Thanks in advance for all the input.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are people here much smarter than I in the business areas, but here's my 2 cents: 1. You still have to pay taxes as a self employed solo practitioner, so be sure to save for that, and 2. Do it.

> **Response 2:** I started my journey July 2023. Fully uncaged Oct 2023. I mainly see Medicare, but a few private. Figure $110/v for Medicare. Run your numbers. I’m the bread winner too.  I’m in PA, so $1000/mo for insurance (family of 5). I’m seeing 25-30/wk. I’ve built a following over the last 14 years, which helps. If your numbers are close go for it!

LLC to an S corp - I’ve been advised by my CPA that this is the right direction for me. For those of you who bill insurance - did that transition affect interacting with insurance or reimbursement at all?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It's just an election for tax classification, no impact on any other business aspect, ein, etc. You will still be an LLC, electing to be taxed as an scorp. 
It could change the way you pay yourself and owner benefit options, etc.

So I’m in California and I went ahead and filed for a S Corp however IncFile stated that I need a professional corporation instead. I thought all I needed was a s corp, receive the EIN number for a business bank account, and obtain a type 2 NPI number for super bills.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Wayne , so I. California you need PLLC with sub SCorp

> **Response 2:** It is my understanding that we need a PC in CA, then file as an S Corp. When I filed in 2018, PTs couldn’t file as PLLC, so depends on your profession…and of course regulations could have changed since 2018!

Does anyone do either a (1) monthly subscription model for “wellness” visits, or (2) a yearly subscription discount (e.g., pay $1800 for a guaranteed wellness/maintenance visit each month) 

I currently offer a 6-visit and 10-visit package which I explain as a plan of care duration, but I am wondering about adding a “subscription” model. Anyone doing this? Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Tried the monthly subscription but didn't find much success with it. We found better success with including it as a "bonus" in our core offer as it really helps show the value of the offer. Took that idea from Alex Hormozi's 100M Offer book and it has been a game-changer.

Hi everyone,
I’m currently in early discussions with an assisted living facility that’s offering to rent me a space for $570/month. They also mentioned potentially taking a percentage of concierge service revenue.

At this point, there’s no formal contract on either side. Before I commit, I’d love to hear from those who’ve done something similar:
 • What are fair or negotiable terms in these types of agreements?
 • Any red flags I should watch out for?
 • Would you suggest a flat rent only, percentage only, or a hybrid?
 • How do you structure services (Medicare Part B, private pay, wellness/stretch programs, etc.) in this kind of setting?
 • Any tips for ensuring the agreement is sustainable and protects my business interests?

Your input would be hugely appreciated. Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wouldn’t get involved with anyone who wants to be in your books and taking a percentage. The flat rate is very reasonable, if you have your own space.

> **Response 2:** Flat rate and a percentage?  No way.  Per person charge or hourly rate most preferred.  When business picks up, a monthly rate may be best.  Keep them out of your books...

**Community Responses:**

Hello all! 
I currently own an SCorp and have had some difficulties with two different CPAs since starting it in March 2022. Current CPA I used for 2023 - I am paying 1500$ for business tax prep and then 450$ for personal tax prep… then I also pay 599$ a quarter for “small business accounting” which includes quickbooks subscription and… bookkeeping? I don’t even know lol. She set up Gusto for me to use where I pay myself through, I’ve I fill out an accountable reimbursement worksheet every quarter and then everything else is run through quickbooks. I also have found every single call I’ve had with her I do NOT understand the answer to the questions I’ve asked such as what I should be paying myself. What Ive paid myself so far has been guesses. So questions: 

1. Is anyone else paying these kind of fees for tax prep and how much are you paying quarterly and for what exactly? 
2. If she cant answer my question of what i should pay myself, how do i know? I know it’s a “reasonable salary” but obviously this will change based on business revenue.. 

Any insight would be appreciated

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a mobile PT business but my husband and I own a hardware store, s corp.  The fees for accounting are what we pay our accountant but gross revenue dictates this. Quickbooks rates have substantially increased in last 15 years. I used to buy it for $299 and it was a working edition for 3 years. Now, it is 1 year subscription (with payroll) and $1400. 
Reasonable salary is what you could hire someone to do your job. Go on glassdoor and check out local salaries for your area. Your salary does not have to change based on revenue unless you are putting in more hours.

Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you seriously being overlooked for not having a DPT?

> **Response 2:** Patrick Walker, I wonder if it has to do with you carrying a larger price tag with your experience. If they are insurance based, their reimbursement rates are the same but newer grads are much cheaper relative to the rates. Outcomes aren't valued as much with insurance. If you can treat someone in 6 sessions but a new grad needs 12, more revenue that way too.

⚖️ of 1️⃣-🔟  How comfortable are you with FAILURE? 

🙋🏻‍♀️ Can you name the last time you failed? 

🌶️ Spicy take: If it wasn’t within the last 30 days, you aren’t taking enough risks. 

🌶️🌶️ Extra Spicy take: Failure is essential to your growth as a business owner. 

🚀 In Launchpad, we teach you how to fail well and come out stronger 💪🏼 Don’t let fear of failure keep you from starting your business!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Failure has always been a learning opportunity for me. Failure tells us where the "knowledge gaps" are located and gives us a chance to fill them in to create something better! Failure is inevitable but it is our response to overcome it that makes us stronger, more resilient and unstoppable. There must be a trial, friction or hardship to develop perseverance. So my encouragement would be to focus on the lesson learned, apply it and always figure out a way to move forward with your new perspective or "knowledge". Great post Hannah DeGroot !

> **Response 2:** I can say I fail in some capacity everyday but I continue to show up and try better!

Is it worth it to purchase the domain you want in .com (for $2500) if .org is currently available?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Buy them all. If you’ve done a good job with a business name, owning all digital real estate is important.

> **Response 2:** Agree with others. If you can tweak it a little to get the .com I’d go that route but if not choosing another works too. The typical understanding of .org for organizations and things like that is shifting since we are running out of urls. But also depends a little on your clientele in my opinion. If you are targeting an older population, stick with .com for sure. Younger population more understanding of difference url endings.

Anyone had Medicare show up for a random site visit before you were actually open? I put open May 1 on the application and they showed up last week . 🤪 I didn’t have my sign up yet and I obviously wasn’t there, so they put that business did not exist .

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dumb question.. but do you have to be there during the hours posted on your door? Our clinic has business hours posted but we don’t have a large volume of patients so we may come in later or leave earlier if we don’t have anyone, or if we are doing some marketing during business hours

> **Response 2:** Yes, lesson learned from my first location. Never submit until ready!

I really feel like it's time I stop working for someone else. It's exhausting trying to make a change in our healthcare system working for a company that just sees $$$. Can I do this? Can I make a change?!? I live in Central Florida currently doing HH but it's a terrifying thought thinking I may not be successful or it may not be sustainable. Advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started with home health then went PRN as I opened up my Luna schedule, now I’m very busy with Luna and plan to open cash/wellness services soon and only see a HH patient once in a while.

> **Response 2:** Hi dear anonymous. What have you done to change it through your job? What small changes did you make that did and did not work. I’m curious

Anyone uses or recommends Simplepractice for EMR .. I just have started mobile PT practice ( solo) as side hustle … price looks very reasonable

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cash or insurance?

> **Response 2:** I haven't used simple practice, but I did demo it and I didn't think it was anything special.  I encourage you to demo many different EMRs before making the decision. We made the mistake of not doing a whole lot of demos when we first started and being stuck with one that we didn't love.

Hey I would really like all of your opinions!  I am hearing up to open a brick and mortar location, with PT and sime other services.  There is a location that I am looking at in a small shopping center.  Price is good, but not really a desirable center with a 7/11 and a few other shops.  On the other hand it is very centrally located in the middle of tons of housing, next to my kids school, next to a park where all the kids play baseball and soccer.  Do you think location and reputation will make people look past the rest of the shopping center?  All advice is appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ask the other tenants how they like being there…. And what their interaction with the landlord has been. Consider also how safe you feel coming and going there by yourself at night. Also look closely at parking. Very closely. That can be a big deal breaker for patients if the parking is sparse, or they have to walk far to get to your suite.

> **Response 2:** Always remember. Location. Location. Location. Would you be going there or your kids? Parents if you will have therapy?

Yoga/Tennis LLC Question: If I am teaching yoga and tennis as an independent contractor through my llc do I need personal or business insurance? I am the only person in my llc but working under other gyms/studios. Also, do I need PT insurance for my license even though I’m not providing PT services? 

Thanks for your help and input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would establish yourself as a business entity for tax benefits and for the protection of your personal assets.  You do not need “PT” insurance if you are clearly not providing therapy

> **Response 2:** I have berxi and they cover a PT and their ancillary services like personal training.

Hey all. Anyone willing to chat about getting their home zoned to start seeing patients out of an office space/garage? I'm trying to keep overhead costs down as I get started. Just got off the phone with my town and they'll need me to apply with my business plan, expected patients/day/hr, etc. and from there go through zoning dept. 

Super new to this and definitely feeling slightly silly as I had no idea this was part of the process to practice out of your home😅 I only anticipate seeing around 5 patients/week MAYBE to start and planned to sublease space at some point from there. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How much are you going to spend anyways in renovation etc? And how much are the usual commercial rent? Are you in a high traffic area? Are you comfortable seeing people and bringing them to your home? 

Always think with the end in mind. I know we want to save and start slow and low. Go around your neighborhood and look for commercial establishment that does build to suite. That's how I started mine. I got our clinic started without spending a dime. Well, of course a little bit. But you know what im talking about. I got free rent. They have me a budget of 40-50k for construction etc. Good luck and you got this!

> **Response 2:** Look into your zoning laws and structure your business to coincide with the laws … for example … one client at a time (not group therapy) for example, our area approves of one client at a time so that multiple cars are not in your neighborhood at one time.

Which EMR is the best and easiest for generating superbills? I currently find superbills to be my biggest time consuming task. I would like to find an EMR that easily generates superbills for the entire month. I also need to be able to add discounts and packages as I offer those for patients who do not have OON benefits.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use IntakeQ (practiceQ), very easy to do superbills and allows for packages and pricing adjustments

> **Response 2:** Jane is amazing. I would generate a whole month in seconds.

I am all cash based, no insurance . 

I don’t take any credit cards or hsa currently just for ease and have never had issues (i accept cash, check, zelle)

A patient today asked this. Any insight into hsa checks?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve had a patient use HSA checks— they work just fine in my experience.

> **Response 2:** I take HSA cards- I use stripe (and previous took IvyPay) and any card is charged a 3% fee which I pass on to the client.

I’m starting a small cash-based speech therapy side hustle and need to choose where to open a business checking account. I’m curious about how people usually pay for cash-based services (actual cash, checks, credit cards, Venmo, PayPal, etc), and if it still works to use online checking, such as Novo, when people pay cash. Wondering if brick and mortar banking is more convenient,  but of course I want to avoid fees.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use US Bank. Found all the other big banks had too many fees. Credit unions can be a good choice as well. Patients pay me through cash, check, debit/credit card through Square, venmo mostly.

> **Response 2:** Credit cards. I would never want to carry cash. Plan your rate with credit card fees in mind.  I personally don’t like it when businesses charge a credit card fee. So I just “include” the fee in my rates.

**Original Post:**
Superbill question.  

I'm a PT working in home with infants, fully OON.  I charge a flat rate regardless of session length.  I use Jane and don't have many families wanting superbills, but when I do I had initially been inputting codes without itemized costs and it generally worked.  Now I have my second case asking for itemized cost by code.  My visits are most often around an hour so I just divided my flat rate that way and it worked for the previous baby that always worked out to 4 units, but this baby's visits have fluctuated more, so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.  If I say it's 31.25 per unit that works for most sessions but there have been some with only 2 or 3 units but I still charged 125... so there is a gap.  

Doesn't seem correct to keep changing the itemized code cost.

I keep seeing people say to use prompt pay discount to arrive at their flat rate fee, but that would require me to falsely jack up my itemized cost and always then discount it (by varied amounts)?  
... But that also doesn't seem right

Sorry for the overexplain, hopefully it made sense.  Thanks for reading! 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been there too… I unfortunately just charged a lesser rate (2-3 units instead of 4) for those sessions. It doesn’t happen often.

> **Response 2:** I would make your itemized cost equal per unit and equal the lesser unit amount and then apply discounts if the unit amounts were higher than anticipated.  E.g. $125 cash typically gets 30 minutes or 2 units, but I went for 38 minutes this visit and per 8 minute rule I could charge 3 units, but I gave a discount for the third unit, so no charge for patient Ed, but charge for neuroreed 1 unit at 62.50 and therex at 1 unit 62.50 rates. Pretty sure you can have void units on activities you don't want to bill a full unit on Jane e.g. 7 minute activity is 0 units, but still doc the activities and cite it as no charge 😉 just follow 8 minute rule, match number if units to total time (60 minute session is typically 4 units),  err on side if caution. People are usual pleased with discounts or write off, but frown in session to session breakdown discrepancies like there 1 unit was this amount and now it is more expensive... hope this helps

Hi everyone. I am about to become a private practice cash based owner. Having some difficulty setting rates for PT service. Can anyone suggest rates for IE and follow up visits??  Package rate and what a package may consist of??  Live in Savannah. Ga   Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Lisa, we spoke earlier 😊 we are also in GA. My husband was doing $150 eval and $120 per visit but changing to $150 for all visits now. We tried packages but it didn’t work as great as per visit since we work with older population and often they have changes in their conditions, required hospitalizations for other reasons, etc. I hope it helps 😊

> **Response 2:** I strongly encourage you to reverse engineer your rates.

How much do you want to gross per year? Divide that by 48 weeks, then by how many treatment hours you want to complete per week, and you'll have your per session anchor.

For those that do wellness, how much do you charge for your clients? I have a Medicare patient that will benefit from strictly wellness once I discharge her. I don't want to charge too much due to her being on limited income. Any thoughts?

I’m seeing a new patient who is in-network, but they have a high deductible. Since the deductible hasn’t been met, the patient will likely be responsible for the full amount. Although I’d like to charge them as self-pay, I understand that because I’m in-network, I must bill insurance according to the contracted rates.

For a typical session involving 4–5 units, how should I bill this appropriately?
This is only my third patient as a new practice owner, so I want to make sure I’m doing everything correctly.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should have a fee schedule for what you charge per unit for each CPT codes. The amount they pay would be based upon your fee schedule and the units billed.

> **Response 2:** Ah ok, so their deductible hasn't been met, the clinic will charge based on their insurance carrier, that goes towards their deductible, say for instance $160 for the first visit and $130-70 the 2nd, until the deductible is met, then the co-pay kicks in.

What’s the Best Way to determine what I should be charging as a mobile therapist in my area for a cash base PT? I am in bucks county Pennsylvania about an hour outside of Philadelphia ￼￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are so many factors. Get a sense of what other mobile practices in the area charge i(f there are any.)
Do you know the socioeconomic status of the area you were treating? 
You have to choose a number that you are comfortable saying and standing behind and you can always increase your rates. I would never make my cash pay rates less than what Medicare reimburses.  I know practice is that charge over $300 a session and I know others that charge 100. I don’t need to be the most expensive in the area, but I also don’t want to be the cheapest.

> **Response 2:** No less than a massage therapist or personal trainer in the area

**Original Post:**
I’m looking for motivation to move into private practice. Big healthcare institutions are getting scary-lay offs, short staff though at least adherent to ethical guidelines from my experience. Chain private therapy places see a ridiculous number of patients per hour utilizing techs to deliver treatment, two evals simultaneously, and questionable quality care. While I understand they are polar different settings-my worry is that branching into private practice means almost being forced to compromise “ethics” with respect to treatment-in order for it to be financially good. Is it this groups experience that to be lucrative in the private arena that you need to function at those ridiculous productivity levels?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** look at the business structure of these chain private practices.  Their PT's generate plenty of revenue.  But that money is syphoned off by managers, middle managers, marketers, corporate brass etc. (who themselves generate zero revenue---but still take an expensive salary, bennies and bonuses.  To do this, they work the PT's to death.   When you branch out on your own, you generate income for you only.  By keeping your expenses down, going at it on your own works easily.  Compare it to other business which require massive inventory, often times perishable inventory, and service businesses are easier to start and much more successful.

> **Response 2:** Short answer: No. That is not necessarily the case, and I think this group has a wealth of people who could go into detail on how they protect their patients and their employees.

If you decide to start your own thing, YOU decide what "lucrative" is. And your mission, vision, and values -- and how those play out in the day to day. 

If you just want a change of scenery, see if you can find a practice from this group that's hiring.

**Community Responses:**

Any PT's out there that work in a school setting seeing their student-athletes after school?  I've been invited to come into the school twice a week to assess, treat, rehab, etc.  They've been let go by the surrounding hospital based ATC's.  I'm a cash-based PT owner.  Not sure what to charge for this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jackie Clark.  This is her jam

> **Response 2:** Hi! So I’m in a unique situation where I’m employed by a larger hospital system to provide sideline coverage at all athletic events, I’m a SCS, CSCS and have my emergency reps once for athletes. If athletes have major things going on that I can’t “quick fix” then I see them through my cash based company! I charge my PT rates and strength and conditioning rates for this but it’s in my garage. As far as what to charge in the school that depends on how many kids you’re seeing those few days a week. I would definitely recommend talking to them about charging on an individual rate or hourly rate and explaining your worth to them and what the students will be getting out of it. It’s definitely a tricky situation and the school isn’t going to want to spend a lot of money unfortunately. But as you gain trust with the kids and parents you can ask for more. Does that help at all??

Hiring my first Cash Based clinic PT. What's a fair percentage of compensation of the total per visit rate? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it depends on your session cost, your overhead, and how much you are wanting to make off of your staff. I give my contractor 65% which ends up giving me about $20-30 a session after paying rent, expenses, etc.

> **Response 2:** No offense to anyone above, but if you have a brick and mortar clinic (as opposed to the lower overhead mobile model)￼, you are shooting yourself in the foot if you’re paying staff much more than 40% of revenue generated. ￼￼ Overhead adds up quickly and you could soon be at small enough margins that you don’t give yourself wiggle room and opportunity to invest enough into advertising and other costs of growth.￼ 

If you charge adequately for your services, you can stick with these percentages and still pay (and empower) your therapist as much or more than anyone in your area. I pay better than any popts clinic in Austin and my therapists only see one patient per hour.

Yesterday, we shared Zach Schmucker’s story — a clinician who walked away from comfort to build a faith-led practice that reflects his true calling.

Today, we want to remind you of this:
➡️ You don’t need to have it all figured out.
➡️ You just need the courage to take the first step.

Fear doesn’t go away.

But *faith gets louder* when you start moving toward what you’re called to do. 🙌

If you’ve been sitting on the edge of *“Can I really do this?”* — Zach’s story will speak to you.

Hi everyone, I have given notice at my corporate job and in the process of creating an LLC to branch off on my own! I have a couple business names in mind, however, when searching online to see if they are available, there are a ton of different websites to check. Does anyone know of a legit website that will allow me to check if the name is available for use? Also, Does the name need to be available in my state (AZ) or nation wide? Thank you for any information!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Like most people here have said definitely check with the state when filing. Then once you have the name and logo try to trademark it or at least run a search before creating a ton of marketing materials.

> **Response 2:** When you apply for your LLC the site should have an option to see if the name is available in that state or it likely won’t allow you to create the LLC with that name. That’s how colorados was. Made life easy

Those of you who have done your own LLC and personal taxes yourself. What software have you used? 

I typically use HR Block but am unsure of what version I need to get. 

And yes starting next year I will be having an accountant do them for me. Just haven't made enough for the first year to warrant that this time.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just have the small business version, still working 1099 for some home health. I’m so unsure how to enter my <2k income from December when I started my business. A lady I consulted with said just enter it as income lol but I didn’t give myself a 1099…it was only income to the business. So I’m confused 😂😂

> **Response 2:** Just finished mine with TurboTax premium. (Seemed pretty straightforward and per my research I did it all correctly! 🤞🏼) 
I’m in the same boat of just started my business at the tail end of 2022 so didn’t make hardly anything and didn’t feel like I wanted to pay for an accountant. 

I plan to have an accountant do mine for next year.

Does workers comp work the same as no fault? What should I know before I take a workers comp case? How much does it usually pay?

Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used to make about $220 a visit for work comp. The biggest thing to make sure is that you have preauth. Do NOT take someone’s word that it is covered. Usually, they would approve the eval and then more visits after the eval. Usually, 10 visits at a time is what they did for me. This was 7 years ago. Occasionally, a wc adjuster would call to ask if I thought the patient was malingering or just full faking. I didn’t have anyone I ever thought was completely faking, but I would always write much better bites and put exactly what they said and did.  I do the same with liability claims. I mostly had no problem with wc and have thought about taking it along with my self pay clients.

Who is raising prices for 2025 and by how much? More a percentage or a dollar amount to keep things even? How are you presenting the information and when? Also what is the approximate value difference to buy a package of 10 versus just going visit by visit? Mine is currently basically the cost of a whole visit if you buy a 10 pack versus buying each individual visit.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am not raising but I am going to add a credit card fee of 3% (my state allows)

> **Response 2:** I had a client ask why we weren't increasing prices. Gotta love that! 

I'm comfortable at our $148 price point right now

Seeking advice. Long story, any advice is appreciated. 11 year PT, home health and snf experience. 

This Coming January I'm going to need to take some fmla to be home with my son who is fighting leukemia (all is going as well, but it's a 2.5 year tx). My wife has to go back to work as a teacher in January to keep her job after taking an extended 1 year leave for our sons treatments. Fortunately, if all goes to plan, I should only have to take 3-4 full months off, then he can start going back to school. I'm in nevada, have my llc, type 1 and 2 npi and have dabbled in cash pay in home private services but home health has kept me more than busy and i havent pursued cash pay much. I'm looking at maybe trying to do some cash pay or considerin what it would take to do cash pay/ insurance hybrid while I'm off on fmla after my wife gets home from work. I live in a semi rural area but live 30-45 min from larger areas. How hard was it for everyone to build up a cash clientele and how hard was it for others to break into the referral/insurance realm? Any suggestions on where to start. I have some ideas but thought ideas from like minded individuals could be beneficial. I would like to just supplement my wife's income initially and return to home health ,but if things took off I'd not be opposed. These are just my initial brainstorming thoughts. I may opt to do a long overdue shoulder labrum repair and use some short term disability as well during that time. Please feel free to ask me any pertinent questions and any advice or good vibes to our little guy is appreciated! Picture of us added for fun at one of the local cancer foundation fundraisers!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good luck, prayers for you and the family 🙏

> **Response 2:** For me, word of mouth is HUGE. Most of my Clients have come from someone they know working with me. I would also use local FB groups to advertise your business and expertise. 

I have found the best medical providers to appeal to have been pain management doctors, and other PTs honestly. Many outpatient facilities could refer to you if someone who maybe has difficulty getting to PT comes their way, or maybe has some insurance difficulties, etc. 

Another idea maybe could be to host an event/ fundraiser on your son’s behalf and to raise awareness and maybe provide services or have a booth there? Maybe even provide edu on PT as it relates to CA? Just a thought I had. 

I wish you the best of luck and hugs to your little guy! ❤️

We are considering hiring a PT for a full time W2 position and paying per visit (or per unit).

Any suggestions on this? We are also wondering legally how this works… if we pay per service (units or per visit).. is overtime or time spent for documentation not a factor?

Any advice in this area would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was paid under that model at a previous job. But then they hired 2 salary people and kept trying to shunt my appointments over to them, particularly during my paternity leave. Ultimately because of that dynamic, I was laid off in a really icky feeling way. Worked out for me though -- I started a solo practice and am 100x happier than I ever was working for anybody else. But anyway, if you think you ever might hire someone on salary, that dynamic could arise for you

> **Response 2:** Curious how this works. If full time and per visit what happens if schedule is not full? Is therapist expected to stay onsite through agreed upon hours? What do they do during that time?

What is your take on taking self pay for Medicare patients?

I have listened to Dr. Jarod Carter 's episode on this a few times, but the podcast is a few years old now. (Love your material Jarod Carter!)

Would love to get a discussion going on risk/reward.  Lot of grey area. Thanks everyone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t hesitate 1 bit. I would gladly go to court and/or lose my license if Medicare actually wanted to come after me for to seeing a patient who wanted to exercise their constitutional right to use their own money to see me for a service I’m skilled to provide. I have a consent form that explains the whole shabang. Other than that, I don’t blink at it. Sometimes, you gotta just take a stand for stuff that makes no sense. All the benefit, all the time with wonderful aging patients, incredibly low risk.

Does anyone here do functional medicine as a PT? 

1. How does your pricing model work? Membership, session to session, or..? 

*If you have memebership pricing, but don’t do functional medicine, still please feel free to comment! I would love to know what you include in your membership and at what price!*

2. How to you manage ordering/requesting lab values?

I am just finishing up with AFMCP through IFM and just starting to play with different ideas on how to make some adjustments to my practice.

Thanks! ☺️

**Community Responses:**

Anyone who works with runners, have you found sponsoring local races to be a good ROI? 

All race directors I’ve reached out to charge $500+ to sponsor a race and set up a booth near the finish line. 

As a new business with limited capitol, I want to make sure I spend my marketing dollars wisely. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Offer free post race massages. They would probably wave the sponsor fee. ROI is hit or miss. Good for name recognition but we haven’t gotten a lot of direct referrals. Do about 4 races per year all through the same company.

> **Response 2:** We offer to bring our recovery boots in exchange for the sponsorship, which most of the time the race director will do because it’s a nice service. I hate stretching people after runs so I like this WAY better - I get to talk to the runners for 10-20 minutes while they are in the boots and 90% of the time, we get to talking about their pain or injuries which leads to me being able to make suggestions (which leads to them asking for my card).  I have everyone sign in on the iPad while they are in the boots so I can collect their email addresses too.

Has anyone ever done one session evaluations to write someone a letter of medical necessity for a cosmetic surgery or other surgery or potentially to back the need for an orthotic? I’m trying to see if I can add this as an alternative revenue stream and give people the option afterwards to continue with a POC either through their insurance or cash pay. 

I personally know of 3 people who had breast reduction surgery due to back pain. I’m about to write one for a person who is getting skin removal surgery which is causing mobility restrictions. This seems like it could be a decent source of additional revenue.

What do ya’ll think?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The few patients i have seen in therapy for mastomegaly needed failed physical therapy for their plastic surgeon to write and argue medical necessity. Usually that letter goes along with specific measurements taken by the surgeon to further argue for insurance auth.

> **Response 2:** I'm in a few plastic surgery groups being a lymphedema therapist. Sounds like the surgeon's offices are the ones who code the procedure and get prior authorization. The clients are definitely motivated for the chance to not have to pay out of pocket for some or all of the procedures. Maybe speak directly to the surgeons to see if this is even a problem?

**Community Responses:**

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in Texas and just got done scanning and reading pertinent information of the TMHP provider manual and I’m pretty sure you are not allowed to charge cash pay services, unless medicaid denys for not medically necessary. I could be interpreting this information wrong though.

> **Response 2:** Medicaid is state dependent. You can go online to see what Medicaid covers and if still confused call the office to find out.

Now still grinding to try and grow our practice with volume, providers, and get profit margin higher to sell it as I’m ready for an exit strategy.

I'm considering leasing a small office to work out of and see occasional clients in for my primarily mobile hand therapy practice. How do you guys recommend going about looking for small spaces? Ideally <300 sq ft, which I feel would be more than sufficient for my needs for both cost and storing my equipment. Do you typically start by asking local gyms/chiros? Do you look online? What is an expected and reasonable rate to even be looking at? Am I crazy for wanting a physical office?! 😆

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Also, I'm in the N Atlanta metro area if anyone has a space they think might work!

> **Response 2:** I think I just googled my town and small office space when I started. My first office was 100 sq ft, then I grew to 200 and now I’m just shy of 300 :) I currently pay $650/month, it’s all inclusive (electricity, internet, snow removal), the building is owned/shared with a chiropractor and exterior home updates company.

Hello! I'm a pelvic physical therapist in San Francisco, looking to start work in January or so. 

I am trying to decide if I want to work for myself with my own mobile services, or if I want to work in an out of network/cash-pay clinic. 

I would love to talk to someone one on one who is living in the Bay Area about the pros and cons of each, how much to charge, etc. I would also love some help as to where to start if I do want to build my own business. Any info helps.

Thanks in advance!

For us mobile practices...how do you guys pay your therapists? We are looking to bring on a PRN OT and PRN PT. They both would like to start off being PRN and as they grow their caseload would like to be part time.

**Original Post:**
I'm starting to think about a small price increase at the beginning of the year. I hate to do this because I know inflation is hitting everyone hard. January 2025 will be 2 years since I had my first price increase which was drastic because I set my initial prices too low. Now I really just need to account for inflation so I'm thinking $10-15/session.  In 2023, I allowed all current clients to stay under the current pricing which was kind of a pain but worked itself out by March or so. My current eval price is $60 higher than my follow up rate. Hindsight I wouldn't have done this but it made more sense when I was selling packages and offered longer eval times. However, now that all sessions are 1 hour across the board, I'd like to go to one rate. My questions are:

How do you determine by how much to increase?
How would you narrow the gap between the follow up rate and eval? The extra money when I have more evals on my schedule is nice but from a financial planning and goal setting point, it makes more sense to me to have 1 price across the board. 

Would love to hear anyone else's thoughts/experiences.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I actually want to increase my eval prices so that they're more expensive than my sessions even though both are one hour long!

> **Response 2:** I kind decided how much to increase by how horribly uncomfortable it made me to say it out loud, And then said 
Know your worth Queen 
And carried on

Hi all, I'm considering a mobile PT practice here in Texas and have several questions even after performing several searches:
1. LLCs - are they really necessary or can I just use myself as a sole proprietor?
1. Malpractice insurance vs business insurance - are they the same? Recommendations?
1. Documentation - how do we go about documenting? And what about those that are asymptomatic and want to improve their well-being? Do we keep everything locked away since we don't have to submit to insurance?
1. Rates - how much do you typically charge per visit?

I'm in the super early stages of this whole thing and have one client interested in improving her overall fitness. I come from an OP ortho background. Thanks in advance.

Anyone ever used a recruiter to find PTs??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I looked into hiring a recruiter for OTs at one point and were out of my budget. Overall charge was 1.5x what OT was paid. The cost included liability insurance and credentialing. The candidates they found me were terrible, unfortunately. When I asked why, I was told I should be offering "a lot more per hour" which basically meant I was gonna be out of business. We can chat more tomorrow for our agenda meeting 😇

> **Response 2:** I recently hired 1 OT and 2 PTs. No recruiter needed.

For people with independent contractors working for them…. Do you have weekly or even monthly zoom meetings?

Is it legal to require a meeting without paying a contractor for it or do I need to make a meeting rate and pay everyone to attend?

Wondering what method works for team communication on a “remote” team.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I pay mine whenever we meet.  As mentioned above we can’t legally require attendance at the meetings (that gets into the definition of employee). I pay a bit less for meetings.  I normally send mass emails out and only have meetings if needed.  My admin also does “check-in” with IC to address any issues.

> **Response 2:** I am a contractor working for two different companies (HH & OP mobile). It’s not legal to require meetings and not pay a contractor. My rate for meetings is different than my pay per visit patient visit rate. Both provide zoom options or I could go in person. One company I work for meetings are optional (I attended once & didn’t get much from it & haven’t attended again). The other, I try to attended weekly since it’s an interactive checkin for clinic health & growth. Occasionally I’ll miss it if my patient schedule is packed & I need to start my day early. 

During the week we use an app/site called slack for communication.

Hello, I am considering buying out the outpatient practice I work in. I have a general idea of business valuation (~1.2x the average revenue over several years).  However, I've been told that since this is a service-based industry, it has less value when sold? 

For the clinicians who own a private outpatient practice, can you shed some insight on where to start or what resources to utilize to get a good understanding? I don't want to sound uncertain or confused once I start discussing this with my boss.  Thank you for your time!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 100% get an attorney and have someone do due diligence on their finances before any offers are in the table

> **Response 2:** Don't do this without attorneys for contracts and accountant to make a proper valuation.  Can cost more upfront but can save you huge amounts of money down the road.

I am currently a Medicare/ cash mobile PT in Florida.  I have been growing for the last few years, but exploded this January when I started to take Medicare (even though that is only about 30-40% of my business).  

I have a PTA starting in July, and will ramp up my marketing in the next week or so to get her schedule filled. So far my growth has been word of mouth.  

I have found a brick and mortar that is near our small town’s downtown, and I have fallen in love with the space. But, I have no idea where I would start to figure out if I can make it happen financially, and fill it.

How do I go about projecting numbers/ financials for a new hire and a space.  Also, things like.. is it a good size, a good price (i have looked at other listings nearby and it is comparable)? Is there a way to objectively figure out if it will be profitable enough to incur this new overhead and possible headahces associated with leasing?

Also is there a magic formula to determine when I am able to “afford it.”.  I.E. 3-6 month emergency fund (dave ramsey style), have a wait list, have a certain % in savings, etc. 

Thanks so much.  I am super comfortable with being mobile, and it is working very well. However, I am a dreamer and this space has me thinking of ALL the possibilities for growth.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cautionary tale here. I overestimated how many non insured or OON clients I would have and have ended up with 95% Medicare. I am not even close to covering all of my expenses and am now trying to break my lease after only 2 of 5 committed years w/o declaring bankruptcy so I can shift to a less expensive location. Covid really changed building occupancy. I was told my building was 95% leased. The building is practically empty because entire floors are empty. I don’t get the young professionals in I was anticipating. Construction started across 2 streets and took all of the parking I thought I would have. I should have fought harder for a true break lease clause.

> **Response 2:** You really just have to run the numbers. Come up with your average reimbursement per visit (and I always low ball this). Come up with what your expenses will be once you hire (and I always overestimate this). You can also underestimate how many visits you and the PTA will have total per week. If the numbers still work, then you’re good.

Distraction- the first of the great killers of your business. 

There's an amazing phenomenon that happens as you start to see opportunity around you. Similar to how you start to see the car you want to buy all over, opportunity starts to show up all over the place as well. 

As a staff PT, there's no reason to see opportunity so we often close off our minds to the possibility that there are opportunities outside the traditional staff PT position. 

More and more people are starting to see that this isn't the only option and that they can become "UNCAGED." Then they start a practice and hear all the different things that everyone in this and other groups are doing and there's a level of FOMO that happens that makes us think that we need to pursue every opportunity around us. 

One of the most important things that you can do as a business owner is figure out what's working, find the opportunity (not generally the opportunities) that you want to pursue and then focus and be engaged in that and not let yourself get distracted. 

People often think coaching is only for people who need help figuring out opportunities and strategy but one of the less valued but extremely important aspects of a coach is to help keep you focused on what's the most important.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** SO TRUE!! Many recognize that the greatest value in having a coach is to keep them focused! 🙌

**Original Post:**
Hello everyone,

I have a few questions where I am stuck currently. Sorry for the long post. 

I started my business as a side hustle and planning to go all in next year. I started with my price being below average according to other practitioners. I am cash based/out of network concierge PT. 

1. I want to increase my pricing starting January, with travel time, one on one hour, I do not think it is sustainable long term with the current pricing I have. Does any one have a letter format or any templates they use to send it to the clients? 
If I have new clients, do I tell them the new price from January, how to go forward with this? 

2. I have started offering pelvic floor PT services and added that as a specialty. I have different pricing for pelvic floor patients as compared to non pelvic floor clients. I am not very sure if I should keep the pricing different or same for pelvic floor clients, if it’s higher, should I increase the time that I treat the pelvic floor patients for? 

Do any of you have different pricing for things you treat or do you keep it all the same. Any guidance or help here would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you !

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I charge the same rate for everything that I do from physical therapy to a wellness visit. This was good advice given to me a while back. The reasoning is that if you start seeing someone for wellness and charging them one rate and then they tweak their knee and they need you to take care of that, then it’s difficult to adjust the rate. So i suggest you just stick to one rate for your time…Period. 
As for your current clients, you could grandfather them in at their current rate, or slightly increased rate, if you’d like. However, if they take a hiatus from you for any reason, then I would suggest that they return at the current rate.

> **Response 2:** You also have the option of grandfathering in current clients. If it's only a side hustle and you don't have a full caseload but want to honor and keep current loyal clients, you can raise your price point for new patients but keep your price point for current patients. Some of our clinicians have done this. I did it for a couple long standing patients that I had been seeing for a long time.

Hello. A patient of mine has UMR insurance (upstate New York) 

He submitted his superbills. 

I WAS PAID IN FULL AT TIME OF SERVICES. 

What the heck does this mean?????

Someone please help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ignore… when they call either ignore (they keep calling) or finally answer and let them know services were paid in full and no negotiation… they will finally get your drift and quit calling.

> **Response 2:** I won’t do it. I have heard they don’t pay for a long time & then there’s always strings & don’t fully reimburse the clinician as “agreed” too. No surprise there.

While searching through this group, I noticed a lot of people don't put their rates on their websites... What is the reason behind this...?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I DO put my rates and most of my colleagues do, too. I find transparency is key.

Then I think about me as a consumer. If a website doesn’t have prices listed, I don’t even bother.

> **Response 2:** Because you’re already letting the patient decide for you whether or not your services are needed based on your rates.

Motivating post… Was contacted by patient’s family member who is looking to hire a private practice PT. After talking with her, it became apparent she actually was never taught foundational knowledge of caring from a functional mobility standpoint (She had an extensive exercise packet that included ankle pumps, though). They owned equipment, hired caregivers, had two other family members and patient was being seen by home health intermittently previously. When I went over and met them, I was able to teach them how to do a two person transfer of the patient safely with a slide board from the hospital bed to their custom wheelchair. First time up in it in a year. It opened the world to them to know that they would be able to take her outside, tilt her back or do her hair, and it was really more about their piece of mine as well as the parent. In case you need to know why it’s so important that you all open good common sense, clinical practices, this is why! If there is anyone in the Fremont California area available to take on a lower level patient, DM me.

**Original Post:**
Looking for assistance with hiring and negotiations! I usually try to avoid anonymous posts to be more personable but I currently have applicants and feel like it's better anonymous. 

I am hiring a PT 1099 (I know this can be controversial). They will be paid per session. If you have contractors or employees that are paid per session... do you have a separate evaluation rate vs treatment rate? Do you aim to pay a certain percentage of what you bring in as a private pay practice?

Also, my treatment sessions are typically an hour. I'm finding it difficult to expand the schedule to accommodate close to 40 hours without feeling like it's going to cause burnout. Taking into consideration have a lunch in the middle of the day, this would either be 5 days x 7 clients (35 hours) or 4 days x 9 clients (36 hours). I know that 1099 “make their own schedule” but their hope is to achieve full time Any recommendations on navigating this?

Thank you  for your advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I pay the same because I don't want to incentivize less treatments to make room for evals

> **Response 2:** Just FYI what you are describing does not sound like a 1099 situation—I would very carefully look up your DOL regulations. I got audited and had a OT (I am PT) who worked about about 10 hours for me and I was fined for not classifying them correctly—this was a very limited need for a single client.

So I recently started a  cash pay practice and give discounts to my loyal clients that I’ve seen for years on the side.  

I provide everyone super bills so they can try and get reimbursed if they want.  I’ve recently learned that this might be insurance fraud because I’m charging different people different rates.   Is this true?

> **Response 1:** To cover your bases, create a GFE form that includes a “payment same day of service “ option.  This rate can be available to anyone that pays in full same day of services (or on advance with a package).  This way an insurance qualifies (if they pay same day—-which they never have and never will).  Keeps you clean.

> **Response 2:** Is there an issue charging the same per unit for each patient but then offering a loyalty discount with specific criteria defined?

What wording do you use for website/marketing materials/elevator pitch to get the idea across that you are cash-based but not cash pay only? Am I making sense? I've had a couple of people say, "I don't like to carry that much cash on me". 🤦‍♀️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cash based is more of an inside term for us in the industry. Try a customer facing phrase such as “out of network” or “private pay”

> **Response 2:** “Self-pay”, “private pay”, “not in network with insurance”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds kind of cookie cutter.!?

> **Response 2:** There’s definitely a mental shift on the side of the consumer when it’s worded as there being an effective, finite program. It gives it structure in my mind and communicates to me that if I follow it, it will work. And that’s not forever just to reach my short term goals.

I’m interested in hearing from folks who have used Gusto for payroll and how that compares pros/cons to square payroll, ADP, quick books, paychex etc. 

I have a small practice and would like a system that handles 2-8 employees efficiently

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** One con is if you want to set up a pay per visit type of model, there currently Isn’t an option for this.
We use it as an “hourly” offer and then in the offer letter and in person explain how their compensation is different. 

Otherwise, it’s been great for us!

> **Response 2:** I have used ADP--support isn't super helpful and they spend all my payment on sales to try and get me to buy more services, at least 4 calls or emails per week. Square I liked but they didn't do next day payroll processing and it was a must for where I was at in my business at the time. Using Gusto now and I have been very pleased so far. Smooth onboaring, lots of tools for the same price as ADP basic.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Had one of my first patients offer to “help me get more patients” by referring her friends (she lived 90 min from my clinic) but wanted to trade her art for her insurance’s pre-set copay rate. Her art was not my taste, let’s just say. I also tried to explain to her I didn’t set the copay- her insurance company did and if she wanted lower copays she could just pay higher premiums. She did not like that. We parted ways after a few sessions when it became clear we were not matching well….

> **Response 2:** So many think that we set the price. Have to tell them it's their insurance company. Tell them to haggle with their insurance company over the price lol

Currently a sole proprietor LLC.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just want to help with your wording there. You are a single member LLC not a sole proprietor.  There is a significant difference. Be aware of state and federal laws regarding the difference between a short term contractor and an employee even a PRN one. This is an area where you can face significant penalties if classified incorrectly. Becoming an S Corp is a discussion with your accountant about when this becomes the best option for your overall tax situation

Times have changed significantly since 2016…

That is the year I started my practice - Freedom Physical Therapy.

I remember buying an ebook titled “12 things to do to start your practice” for $50 because I couldn’t find much information online about what to do. It was similar in nature to the free 10 step checklist we give out in this group, but that’s all there was at the time 🤷🏼‍♂️

Now, fast forward to 2023, and we have more information than we know what to do with at our fingertips!

This is GREAT, but it also presents a new problem: information overload. 

Information overload can be paralyzing, in fact, it actually inhibits us in most cases from taking action.

Last year, we saw this problem growing and growing, and decided to launch Uncaged Bootcamp 🥾. 

We saw the problem of a) new practice owners needed access to the RIGHT information, b) new practice owners needed access to the RIGHT AMOUNT of information, and c) new practice owners needed it at a price that they could afford to get the information and guidance they need.

That’s why we launched Bootcamp. 

And the first one of the year is kicking off on Tuesday, January 24th!

Myself, Kevin DeGroot, and David Bayliff will be coaching and teaching you how to set up your practice for success over the course of 4 weeks.

If you are interested, comment “Bootcamp” or 🥾 and we will send you the link to get registered!

**Original Post:**
Question about charging an extra fee for appointments outside of business hours:
I am cash based (and accept HSA/FSA) and am toying with the idea of going into the office on a day off, upon request, outside of normal hours in exchange for an additional fee.  Right now I am just saying no (it’s a challenge to go in as I need childcare), but at times I could finagle it but it’s still a lot of trouble to see one client.

For those who charge an extra fee for this instance: 

1) how much do you charge?

2) what do you call it (extended hours fee?)

3) can you charge HSA/FSA for the additional cost (or would you charge these accounts for the base price and require cash/ check/ personal credit card for the remainder).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I literally am implementing a small fee for similar starting 2026- i am just doing $25 in addition to visit cost if pt wants me on a holiday or same day last min (i am mobile and cash)

> **Response 2:** Our HVAC broke and I had to pay what they called a Saturday fee for a technician to come out on a Saturday to fix it. I think you could 100% offer a convenience fee for evening or weekend hours as long as you’re very upfront about it, but I don’t know that HSA fees would cover it. I don’t do that and I’ve never looked into it. ￼

I run a hybrid practice, self pay 45%, insurance 55%. I am considering adding in a 3% credit card fee. How are you distinguishing between self pay and insurance based patients? For self pay, I would like it to be built into their cost vs charging them every time. I cannot do this with insurance based patients because of co-pay/co-insurance. Does someone else have it structured this way and how do you communicate this to self pay patients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If the credit card transaction fee has you bothered. Raise your price.

Ok guys I have a situation and I’m hoping to find someone to help. There is a man in Leominster MA hospital who is on a ventilator and his wife cannot get a PT in to his room to do some strength training with him. In order to get him off the vent he needs a stronger core and his family does not know what to do at this time. Are there any PTs who have a mobile cash pay practice that could go into the hospital and help this man out? Are there companies that contract PTs out for this type of situation? TIA!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a PT that works in a hospital and has a mobile business I would say this would not be allowed by the hospital and they are not going to contract you to do it. She needs to work with the therapy staff at the hospital to discuss the options.  There is likely more to the story as to why he is not getting therapy.

> **Response 2:** I have years of ICU experience, and love mobilizing on vents. I feel like there’s a lot more to this story. 
What meds is he on? What’s his diagnosis? Are his intensivists calling for PT? Does this hospital have an early mobilizing and ICU therapy crew? 
That being said I can nearly guarantee you that it wouldn’t be allowed to do cash pay in a hospital setting. Way too much liability not only for the cash pay PT but also for the hospital itself I would think

**Original Post:**
Probably will have mixed responses on this but wanted to pose the question. What have people seen with NDAs/non competes. Do they tend to hold up upon leaving a clinic? For reasons I don’t want to disclose, this isnt a good place for me to stay. Buried in our handbook was a NDA that was never discussed. The verbiage states I can’t work physical therapy in general within a certain mile radius that would essentially prevent me from working at all. It seems overly broad.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It really depends on the location I’ve won them before as the owner as long as it’s reasonable. It also can’t “cause undue hardship” which may be up to a judge to interpret. Be careful of any no solicitation agreements as well. 

If I were you I’d put the whole thing into chatgpt and ask it how you should proceed

> **Response 2:** My understanding is if a patient follows you, that is their business. But if you TELL the patient to follow you, or "call up" your old patients after you left, it would be against the NC clause, and also unethical. That being said- patients I personally BROUGHT to a clinic are still MINE if I leave that clinic.

So, a crane fell on my building during Hurricane Milton and the fire sprinklers went off, apparently for many hours. Most of my electronic equipment and anything cloth or particle board is destroyed. Looks like this is me giving up on the brick and mortar side of the business. I will let the lawyers do their lawyer thing to get me out of this lease. I need to know specifically where in PCOS I remove my brick and mortar practice location and add "mobile" instead. Maybe I'm just exhausted but I'm not finding that in the tutorials. Thank you for your assistance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m so sorry

> **Response 2:** I’m so sorry you are going thru this!  I heard a crane fell up there.  So terrible 😢 my understanding with Medicare is that you just change the place of service to 12 if you are going to peoples home.  When you signed up in PECOS it was either mobile only or it was brick and mortar but that included mobile.  If I’m remembering from Tony’s class correctly.  I would also call the Florida Mac.  866-454-9007

Any recommendations for older client with PD who freezes during golf/tennis and difficulty with walking backwards. Recent decline with 10 yr history PD. Will be starting meds for first time soon.
Music/metronome seems to help with BW walking. Doing BIG daily. Says he’s okay on range but not when on the course/when he’s trying to take peoples monies.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Andrew, I’d concur with what Evie and Kaitlin said already, but would add that maybe he should look into a tune up for LSVT BIG with a therapist, as he could make more gains and it can be done as many times as needed. PWR! Is certainly versatile and could be great too and may be more engaging as something to do in addition to or in substitute or LSVT. 

I’ve been LSVT certified since 2013 and have seen it work wonders. We address freezing of gait a LOT with this method.

> **Response 2:** I’m simply impressed that he’s had a 10 year history and still playing and just starting meds!  Wow . (In addition to Boxing for PD - which I love for RAM )  

See if there’s  a treadmill available, can he practice walking backwards using the railing and then having the therapist stop/ start and change incline to keep that motion going in a controlled environment. I know that doesn’t transfer to playing, but it’s a good skill to have ￼

If I wanted to do a test and just start out with 1 or 2 clients via cash based services, just to see if its feasible and something I would like to do, what is the absolute minimum I need to get started in the state of NY? I've had a couple people ask I if provide private mobile services and I would like to maybe try it out. Is it possible to get started without formulating a LLC/PLLC?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My Dad did private cash pay patients back in the late 1950s and 1960s. He was a PT at a NYC hospital PT department and then treated some of those patients at their homes when they were discharged. He did this in evenings after the hospital job. He drove many many miles. 
He then branched out into renting or selling them PT equipment, finally setting up an equipment company. 
It’s absolutely doable. 
Go get ‘em!

Im sure this is a common question but first time ive run into this situation and thought i knew the answer but want to make sure. I have a patient that came in as a cash pay but reports having traditional Medicare and that she has had 2 other clinics tell her she can pay out of pocket for the first 8 or some visit before needing to use it and get Physician referral. Almost like as if direct access laws applied to cash pay for Medicare beneficiaries. Ive never heard this before but she says she does not want to use her insurance. I am in Florida

prices in 2025 and read some posts from you all on how to do so. My question is, did this backfire for anyone? Any scary stories? I’m so fearful to loose my current clientele if I increase by $15 or more per visit. Words of advice? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your price is your price! The people that see the value in services will pay! We are so undervalued  and underpaid as a profession. If you can provide results and can change someone’s  life for the better, they will pay for it!

For those that don’t, they are not your true audience. On to the next!

I've been seeing a lot about personalized POC vs Packages.  I've done packages in the past and honestly don't really like them.  Would someone explain what they're including in a Personal POC beyond 2x6 or something.  Thx

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always suggest a program versus packages — and it’s not just semantics. 

Packages are a bunch of sessions bundled together.

A program has a start and finish, like an Eval +5 expanded treatment sessions. 

The client pays in full or possibly splits payments into two but the incentive for buying the program is not to save money

Instead it’s because that’s the way they will receive the best care and clinical outcome. ￼

> **Response 2:** I felt the same and looked back at what I had done with clients in a personalized POC before. I tend to see people 4-12 times so I made packages for 4, 8 and 12 sessions and recommend which package they get at eval. If they pay in full then they get a discount.

Hi guys! I was asked if I could do cash PT session once a week to a pt who is currently undergoing homehealth PT using their insurance. The reason is to augment what the patient is getting. Pt is currently seeing PT 2x/wk and family wants more therapy session and feels that 2x/wk is not enough for their mom. This is in NY state. Should I take it?

**Community Responses:**

Anybody with a cash-based practice take a student before? I'm working on accepting a student for their clinical but wondering what kinds of liability forms I may need the student to sign. My practice is all private and cash-pay, no insurance at all. What things should I prepare or do before taking the student? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a cash pay clinic there is really not much of a difference when accepting a student vs being insurance based - here are some things to be aware of to cover yourself and your business -

Make sure you have the proper liability coverage as a healthcare provider and as a business entity (OSHA, state regulations, whether you are set up as a mobile or brick n mortar or Telehealth - they are safe and not exposed to risk of themselves or your patients)

The PT school should be an accredited program and have all the necessary paperwork to help set you up as an affiliate educational site: usually they have liability coverage to cover their interns but still cover your bases on your end since they are treating your patients and working on your site or traveling with you in your vehicle) 

You have proper HIPAA, and intellectual property forms set up for them to sign. 

If you have a policies and procedures manual and since they will essentially be part of your team - make sure they read and sign off on that as well.

I would speak to the school CEC to give them a formal run down on how you run your practice and if it will fit all their requirements on number of hours worked, number hours of direct patient contact, setting up of objectives and expectations on your end as a CI.  Even interview the intern to be sure they will get what they might want to get out of their educational experience and if it meets your expectations and abilities.  

That about sums it up - reach out if you have a further inquiries.

> **Response 2:** Sorry I know this is not a direct answer to your question but I assume the student will be treating patients independently at your cash based practice. Do you think your cash paying patients will feel comfortable having a student treat them? I'm just asking because I assume they are coming to you and paying the cash pay services because of your experience and expertise.

I may have an opportunity to work at a clinic that does one to one treatment. So get paid only when see patient. Salary would be less than what I make in a regular clinic setting amd would have to build patient load at  first. Anyone else ever work for someone with this type of clinic.  I feel like I would love it but financially don’t know if could do yet.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I hate these set ups. It’s like taking on the risk of biz ownership without having the reward. That’s my take. But to each their own!

> **Response 2:** I am not opposed to the salary one on one. Not when most clinics expect 2-4/h. BUT no to the shared risk. You get paid for every hr in the clinic

Here is a visual on why your cash practice will succeed. I told my daughter to try her insurance at the doctor for a simple visit. The cash rate you could accept was $100. We are now removing her insurance from her profile and using the cash rate instead.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Then you never meet the deductible.

> **Response 2:** In this case the patient may never meet the deductible especially if it is high and they are relatively healthy. I've had deductibles as high as 6k for the year. Sometimes it makes sense to pay the cash rate vs using the insurance.

Hi all!

I’m in the works of starting up a cash based mobile practice in NJ. Just a few things I wanted to get some advice/opinions on for those who are doing cash based/private practice.

What sort of cancellation/no show policy do you have?

Do you do any bundle deals? For example buy X amount of visits for a certain dollar amount or percentage off?

Thanks in advance!! Im open to any suggestions/advice on cash based as this will be my first time jumping in ☺️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi brit! Definitely recommend selling packages. I find that a lot of pt quit after feeling better, where's that would be the best time to actually work harder.  Helps to have them committed to therapy too

> **Response 2:** Most recommend bundles but I just do an hourly rate. 

I have a cancellation policy but I am not currently enforcing it. It would upset my good patients more than it would deter my bad patients. I just make people who keep canceling take less prime spots or schedule out in a few weeks because I’m too busy.

Someone i treated approx 6 months ago at the part time job mustve googled me- found me on linked in and then also my fb page for my llc. She messaged me saying she wants to see me 1 on 1 with my llc. I usually just say no, because I feel bad that it was a patient from my part time job. I dont want any blurry lines. But she did reach out on her own. What do i do? Im usually a play it safe person

There is a gym in my area that has recently opened a recovery room (sauna, cold plunge, 6D massage chairs, red light therapy). I would love to jump on at the opening and offer "wellness work".  What do I need to do this? My thoughts are LLC, liability insurance, wavier stating liability and difference of wellness and PT and that wellness is not medical care. Anything I'm missing? I would be offering "manual wellness" (i.e. stretching and soft tissue work). Is this something that is possible? What would the charge be? The gym would get a cut of course. Thinking of doing 15min or 30min sessions.

I had a change of heart and would like to change the name of the LLC. I've heard that doing a DBA might be easier, however I have no marketing, branding, commercial insurance contracts at this point and only have one patient, so I figure this is the time to formally change the name.

Does any one have experience with changing the name of their LLC (not DBA)? As far as I know I need to file an ammendment with the state (NJ), the IRS, and update PECOS, NPPES, and CAQH. 

I believe the EIN stays the same but do I need a new Type 2 NPI as well? Does the name change affect any pending claims with Medicare? 

Thanks for your help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I rebranded in the winter and in Minnesota I initially considered doing a DBA but at the state level (at least) a DBA filing doesn’t  protect your business name from another person using it (so someone else could come along and file a LLC which is protected with your DBA and you’d have no rights to fight them on this).  I didn’t find the process all that terrible.  It’s like changing your last name with marriage.  Lots of companies to contact but not the end of the world

I’m not in network with any insurances so I can’t speak to that but to update a business name change with the IRS I just had to write a letter and it was processed on their end in a few weeks.  The instructions are online, I found it to be very straight forward.  I believe the process can be longer if you are changing from a LLC to say a S-corp due to change in tax structure

> **Response 2:** Get a new EIN and start over vs the 1yr + to complete a proper name change w the IRS

For those of you that have a 100% mobile practice and use Gusto (hopefully there is someone in here haha), what do you guys have as your work location? 

Currently, I have it set as my home address but then each employee shows up as a different work location with their own home address. 

I asked Gusto and they said they can't answer that question only more of how to set things up. I will also follow up with my CPA. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We were told to have our therapists put their work location as my house address … since that’s the business address and technically the base of operations.  Our Admins put their home address since they work 100% from their home!!

> **Response 2:** Ok. I’m 31% clinic but ….. I’m expanding to a different state (only Mobile) and I’m using this there ….

There’s a local pain clinic that is wanting to start a PT side of their practice.

One of the pain docs is an acquaintance of mine that is a partner there. He called and asked if I would be interested in possibly helping start and join them and be a partner. Not sure of all the exact details yet. But how does one talk about partnership in this situation?

He also mentioned they may be interested in buying my practice and compensating me. Don’t think I’m interested in this.

But as far as what to say or what to ask, where do I start? Anyone ever been in a similar boat? I Don’t want to sound naive and not know what I’m talking about then get the short end of the stick.

The pain doc that called me said that they don’t know anything about PT or where to even start on how to go about things.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If the physician plans to LLC the PT side consult legal issues just to be careful. There can be issues with physician owned clinics where they refer only to “themselves “

> **Response 2:** I was/am in a similar position, although I did not have my own clinic. I was approached by an OBGYNs office to start a pelvic health clinic for them as they also did not know anything about PT and especially not everything we can treat with pelvic PT. I am pretty much an employee, salaried and I own a percentage of the clinic, did not require my own money to purchase. They handle billing, marketing (I develop education for patients and physicians), and referrals. They're building a clinic on the first floor of their office so I was involved in clinic layout and equipment purchasing. Let me know if you have any questions.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** your hourly, plus prep time, plus travel/expenses

> **Response 2:** I used to do my hourly rate and realized it was always at least 2 hours when I took into account prep work plus any follow up resources.

**Community Responses:**

Any clinicians here doing strictly cash/private pay and not offering superbills? I’ve heard of a couple of PTs doing this in my area. Is it within our rights to provide services as cash pay only, regardless of a client’s insurance coverage? I know I’m not the only one who is sick and tired of the system and wants nothing to do with insurance companies, Medicare included. And yes I realize that this would limit referrals, but I want to know the legality of completely eliminating insurance from the equation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am a cash pay practice with an ST background that now only does dementia coaching & consulting. I was doing traditional ST and cash pay dementia coaching 4 years but the past year I haven’t done ST. If your plan is to provide skilled ST to the 65+ population I highly recommend taking a course to better understand. It is more in depth than a FB post can explain. I took the Zero to Paid course 5 years ago but you could also take an ST specific Medicare Billing course created by Katie Brown.

Question for those PTs doing mobile visits, do you charge a flat rate for a mobile visit or use mileage/radius map? I operate out of my home gym and do house visits, but as I raise my current rate I’m debating on raising my rate for house visits. 

Thanks! Happy Sunday

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do a free 20 mile radius around me and then charge extra in a range after that depending on where they live! For reference I’m in PHX so some parts can take me an hour to get to which is why I decided to do it because it can end up being a lot of extra time with traffic, etc!

> **Response 2:** I charge a flat rate to avoid billing headaches. I use the free version of Hurdlr to track my miles driven for work, and it's a tax deduction at the end of the year.

My goal is to close the gap between being personally fulfilled and financially fulfilled treating MCR pts. They are some of my faves but need to make accepting MCR ins make sense.

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

As far as healthcare goes people can and have the right to pay cash for whatever they want! Whether that be your garage, a gym, clinic, or even meeting at a local park.

Virtual session / legal question:

I was just reffered a client who travels frequently and wanting to do virtual sessions. I have questions about he legality of treating virtually in a different state than I am licensed. 

Keep in mind I am cash pay. And will be "providing" the service from my licensed state.
Do i just bill as a wellness visit to get around this?

Any guidance?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** IFFFF you can justify that the session is Wellness, then yes.  But that needs to be made clear with the client - that the virtual sessions are wellness sessions

> **Response 2:** It doesnt matter that you are cash pay or not.  If you are providing skilled services, it falls under your state's practice act re: virtual visits.  If it is wellness than you should be fine.  If it is skilled and u just call it wellness than that is a problem.

Hi all! For those who partner with a gym or studio, do you pay a flat rate for space rental or a percentage of what profit you bring in? What incentives/discounts do you offer the owner/staff members?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I pay a flat rate. I do not offer special rates for owner/staff. I rent the space from a country club but have it in my contract that I can treat non-club members. The benefit I offer to club members is a package deal that is about 15% off when you book 4 or more sessions at a time.

> **Response 2:** We do 20%

Hi All!  I am so excited!  I was invited to be a speaker at my state chapter of an international woman’s organization for high achieving woman. When I said yes, they asked me what my speaker fee was. I said I’d have to get back to them 😳 This is my first time being compensated for a speaking engagement 🥳

Anyone comfortable sharing what they charge for a 30-40 minute talk?  

Do you charge your hourly fee? Do you include prep time?

Thanks in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t have a set number in mind so I don’t know how helpful this will be, but I would consider both what you charge for your time to lecture and also how many hours of prep time will have to going into the lecture. So if you’re going to make a PowerPoint presentation and do a little research and think it’s going to take 3 hours to prep the lecture, perhaps consider that in your fee.

> **Response 2:** Following. I have the same question 🙋🏻‍♀️

Looking for some advice. I just started my side business and opted to go with a chase business account and credit card. I naively didn't see that they have monthly fees. I don't have a steady income with the business yet either. My personal bank is a credit union that does offer business accounts. Should I just close the chase account and switch to my credit union for less fees? Is there a pro or con I'm missing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. My credit union has no fees. I would stay local

> **Response 2:** Yes I had Chase a while back and noticed the fees as well. Never will use them again. I currently use US Bank but credit unions are great as well

When I opened my clinic I was an LLC. I've been busy enough that we were able to transition to an SCorp. The gal at Noridian tells me that I have to fill out a brand new application to change my status with Medicare which is not what I was told initially. Does that sound right? My CPA has done everything with the IRS. Thanks for your feedback

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You have to fill out an election form to be taxed as Scorp. You do not have to re-enroll with Medicare.

> **Response 2:** You will have to fill out and submit a form declaring your tax status as a S-Corp. this is different than an application for an LLC.

I’m not sure I’d run a promotion for a mobile/outpatient practice… unless you had some type of package that you could add a bonus class to or something. 

If you run promotions, think about what you can add as a bonus that doesn’t take additional time/resources from you, but still brings value to them. 🥰

I am looking for advice on how to balance this. I started my busines, I have 3 clients currently but seeing them in home. I just signed my lease for my clinic with a move in date beginning of June. My current full time job is now switching from a 3 day work week to 4 days. So during those 4 days I won’t be able to focus on my business. Will working 1 week day and possibly both weekend days be feasible to build a full caseload? This is for a ped clinic.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think you can definitely build your caseload with one weekday and two weekend days. I think that would work well. Then, once those days are full, that’s when you quit your other job. Hopefully you’ll be making enough money at your business at that point, where you won’t need the other job to support yourself and you can then further build your caseload. When you talk to new patients, just tell them “this is when I have openings”. You don’t need to tell them that you work somewhere else on other days.

> **Response 2:** Any possibility of you going part time? Honestly I was working FT when I started my biz and didn't focus and give as much attention as I had a safety net with my FT job. Then went part time but still not focusing on myself. Everyone is different with different drive so if you want to eventually do your own biz, try to see if you can request the part time or keeping 3 days. I am more driven now to success as my income is my own biz and not other jobs so doing more work/networking.

I plan on changing our Game room to a treatment/gym area. This is what it currently looks like. I do mostly ortho, looking to maybe cert in TPI, live in big golfing area. Any thought on what basic initial equipment I should start with ? The rehab hospital that I currently work for will be selling out all of their equipment.

Hx: After 23 yrs working in a OPPT hospital owned practice finally want to move toward my true goal of cash based private practice. The more I learn the more I realize how much more I need to learn! A bit nervous 😬

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you're going to target golfers, I'd invest in a GoPro or camera that could be set-up to record their swing so you can identify areas of tightness/weakness/pain to work on. A treatment table and perhaps Swedish Ladder for stretching, anchoring resistance bands, etc. I'm always a fan of large mirrors so patients can actually see what I'm talking about when dissecting their movement patterns. It's tempting when there's a sale nearby, but I prefer the less-is-more approach. Perhaps if they are getting rid of a wall-mounted stretching ladder or resistance band "system" and plinth, that'd be a great start. Good luck on your endeavor!

> **Response 2:** The best advice I can give is just take the first step and don't stop you'll never know enough to do it right.  You'll learn and get better along the way.  The first step is ALWAYS the hardest part.  Get the basic things you need and get started NOW!

Also would greatly appreciate ANY tips! TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have my own office space but just to give you a reference I’ve been in business 6months and charge $2000 for 10-visits. 

I’m in pelvic health, and adding Mercier  Therapy to by business next month and plan to raise my program package to $2500-$3000 for 10-visits 

Mind you I also include a pelvic care bag, private online community support, video library of exercises and messaging support in between visits for my clients.

> **Response 2:** I also do mobile personal training. I charge $95 for a mobile visit and  $125 if they are more than a 15-minute drive. 

For cash physical therapy I charge $150 for an eval, $125 for a follow up. 

I know a lot of people charge more but this is what I charge and It works for me!

**Original Post:**
Mobile practice here, first time coming across this, client lives downtown and therapist has to pay $2.50/hr for parking. 1 hr sessions with walking time of a 5-10 min total to the apartment.
What would you guys do? Eat the $3-5/visit and reimburse the therapist for it. The client is likely to do 2-4 visits a week with us between a few disciplines for now or add $3-5 to every visit

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If I practiced by myself and had high profit margins, then I would eat the cost. If I had low margins, lots of employees, already have a high volume of patients and can easily afford to not see this patient, I would charge them the parking.

> **Response 2:** If you’re concerned about $5 parking, profit margins are too low. Company should reimburse this if you work for someone or if you’re cash you’re not charging enough.

Looking for the cheapest most basic malpractice insurance. Any recommendations? TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have CM&F as a single self employed PT. My rate is nearly $600/year. I know some companies do not cover dry needling, which is a major part of my business. 
Really check and make sure you are covered, when I see these really low rates it makes me nervous for people because I can’t ever find those rates with adequate coverage! 

Will add: if I’m missing something and can have cheaper full coverage I’m very willing to entertain other options!

Does anybody have any good, low cost book keeping app? I was recommended Wave, but it doesn't support HIPAA so they don't even let you sign up as a PT. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My question for you is are you planning on invoicing through Wave? If not, wave would be fine (that’s what I use).  Wave can only see the money Square brings in for me and how much is in my bank account through the integrations.  By the time info gets to wave it’s completely separated from any patient identifying info by that point as it’s just numbers. 

For example, if Sally pays me $200 through Square, Wave only sees that $200 eventually was deposited into my account from square, not from Sally

> **Response 2:** I use Wave and just have my bank account sync so I don't have patient information in it. You just won't be able to do invoices

I am so tired of trying to get patients to pay their statements. Our billing dept sends statements via email, then text, then mail. For those who have received at least 2 statements, I (owner) personally call and ask them to please pay. When they actually answer the phone, I'm often met with resistance and excuses. I don't want to write off the thousands of dollars owed, but I also want this off my plate. Any advice or strategies from other owners out there?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Get every patients card on file. Have a list of those clients who have copays, deductibles, or coinsurance due. You run their card at the end of each day/week. Same for cash pay. Takes the burden off of the patient and puts it on the business, but guarantees payment. If they don't want a card on file, then tell them to find somewhere else to get treatment

> **Response 2:** If they are current clients, account needs to be paid up prior to their next treatment or that cannot be treated. Beyond that, collections agency

Those of you that pay an hourly rate to rent space in a gym, may I ask how much you are paying?
Edit: granted I'm looking to rent space in the pool also, so I can imagine the rent being higher than if I was just using part of the gym, but $100/hr is out of my budget. Trying to come up with a counter offer.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ok so it's sounding like $100/hr is outlandish. Lol

> **Response 2:** Holy cow, that's a lot. I pay $30/hour but only hours that I'm actively treating so really I pay $30/treatment session.

If your a cash based mobile practitioner how much do you charge for travel? 

I typically will travel up to 30 minutes; cost built into pricing. I have a patient that has asked that I travel 1.5 hours each way. ( This is a special circumstance.) Funding is coming from a state program,. Thinking of charging  the fedral mileage rate but it’s also an addition 2 hours out of my work day; Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hmm, Personally I would not accept this patient as that would be ~4 hours out of my day. Could you find a provider that is closer?

**Original Post:**
I have a billing question for anyone who does both mobile and in-clinic visits. I recently expanded my in-clinic availability with new space, and so decided to increase my mobile rate by $20 - partly to cover gas, partly for the lost time with driving compared to in-clinic visits, and partly to encourage more scheduling of in-clinic visits versus mobile. 
My question is - I'm not sure how to change this/how this should look in my documentation, specifically on my superbills/invoices. My thought was that I should keep my per-unit rate the same, and just add the $20 as an additional fee - however, there doesn't seem to be any way to do this across the board in my documentation (PT Everywhere), I think I would have to go into each visit invoice and add the fee, which I don't really want to do because (a) it seems less transparent - I want to make sure patients see that additional fee from the beginning if they're scheduling online, and (b) time-consuming.
Has anyone else run into a similar issue? How did you set yours up?
Thanks all!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use PtE as well. Question: Why are you trying to make your per unit rate equal you total visit rate? PtE let's you set whatever price you want. Ignore your per unit rate unless you are billing OON insurance. PtE let's you set the flat rate at whatever you want. Create a "Mobile PT Visit" service and add the $20 to the service price. You don't even to notify the patient you are charging more. When they go to book they will see the mobile visit is more expensive than the in clinic visit. They might not care or they might decide to come in clinic. I'd recommend setting up a new appointment type and charging more for it

> **Response 2:** My population is mainly Medicare so I cannot charge a fee for mobile versus clinic

Quick question about operating an LLC. I’ve owned and operated my speech therapy business since 2020 and am looking to hire my third independent contractor this fall. She asked me an interesting question that I’m not 100% sure about. She was wondering if it might be a good idea for her as a speech therapist to open her own LLC before coming to work with me at mine so that any personal expenses for therapy materials could be written off as tax deductions. My guess is eventually she will want to have her own speech therapy business and that she will use the experience she gets from working for me as a launching pad for her own practice (which is totally fine). I just wanted to make sure that as the owner of an LLC that I can pay the owner of another LLC as an independent contractor and that this arrangement complies with all relevant laws and regulations 🥴. 

Thanks for any input!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That would actually be best for both of you! Just make sure she is actually functioning as an IC and not an employee

Hi! This is my first time posting as I am new to the group. My spouse and I have owned an outpatient PT clinic in Missouri for the last 6 years. Both of us work full time and we have 3 full time DPT’s and 1 part-time PTA. We are starting to feel that we are pretty glued to our clinic and one of our therapists wants to take more of the managerial role to allow us a little breathing room. My question is how I’m the world do you go about this? obviously this is different from a corporation, this is our small business. What tasks/education do you start with?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ask the PT who’s wanting a bigger role? Get them to tell you how they see themselves helping. You can obviously take it or leave it but i think that’s a great place to start. Plus, it will provide some new motivation for your manager.

> **Response 2:** Write down a list of tasks/processes you do on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Then decide how much of that you want to delegate and compensate for. Fairly simplistic, but it’s a good place to start.

Looking for advice: working with a client who is 5 weeks post op Achilles tendon repair and cleared for PWB with wedge in boot. Last week when they started PWB they developed shooting and burning pain into their toes that is worse at night and affecting sleeping. Weightbearing doesn’t cause symptoms, swelling is controlled, minimal pain in Achilles region, however painful palpation spots are along metatarsal heads and toes. 
Any thoughts on causes or treatment options? 
Heat/ice doesn’t improve pain. I’ve had them add padding to metatarsal region of walking boot but little relief so far.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like some tension along the plantar fascia insertion areas. My boyfriend had an achilles rupture and repair with the same boot with WB and ROM progression. Maybe some gentle massage and stretching of the toes/foot, some gentle toe flexor strengthening as tolerated. Monitor achilles symptoms as you go, but that's where I'd start.

> **Response 2:** I’m not an expert just a PT for 35 years. But was it an open repair by any chance is the sural nerve involved ? Could it have been interrupted or impinged in any way.  Does swelling or scar tissue form near the repair that could be invading it ?  Do you know how to do a nerve release or MFR to the area ?

For anyone that has worked on personal injury/lien cases, what has been your experience? I have always stayed away from it because of the long wait to get paid but wasn’t sure just how long you usually have to wait?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I work with these. I ask for the patient to pay me at the time of service then they get reimbursed later. 

I charge $130/hr to prepare paperwork for litigation, meaning printing and mailing the paperwork and documentation. I usually wait until the lawyers ask me for this. I am upfront about this charge when I first take clients. For the first time, I had lawyers only want to pay me $50 for that service. I had to argue with them about how my rate is lower the state statue for that fee. However, our justifications are valuable and I put a lot of effort into my letters and documentation to verify justification for services. 

If I did not get paid at the time of service I would add an interest charge to the money you have to wait for. That way it’s worth it for you. I still never do this… I’d rather be paid at time of service. Just to avoid issues.

> **Response 1:** Nice kick back arrangement he is looking for.

> **Response 2:** Raise your rate by the exact amount he wants for his cut. Tell any patient that asks that the increased fee is to cover the rent.  You walk away with the same.

The referral part is tricky because it’s a med pro. Technically him taking a cut of any referred business is a violation of stark law, but POPTs exist sooo.

My guess is you will get many of these as space becomes more expensive. Choose a number that makes you feel good about it and tell him to take a walk if he negotiates. Sounds like he’s not a big referral source currently? There are a million dentists

For those who provide mentoring, how do you account for that for paying them? I’m considering doing 1-3 hours/week with a new PT- combination of co-treating and blocked off time from the schedule. We currently pay our therapists per visit, so I’m not sure what is fair for when we both treat one of my patients or one of theirs, and then the mentoring time where neither are treating a patient. Hopefully this makes sense. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I moved away from the pay per visit model due to this (that, and our senior clinicians mentor and it was just getting muddy and confusing to pay different rates)

> **Response 2:** I am interested in the pay by visit model for my outpatient.  Would either of you share how much you pay per visit.  For reference I am in Florida.  Our average reimbursement rate is $90 per patient.

I'm considering to raise my prices in a few weeks. I found most OON clinics near me providing pelvic floor PT  are charging $225 for evaluations and follow ups vary based on packages. However the trend ice seen us $150 for a follow up.  These are brick and mortar clinics. 

I'm a mobile PT and I charge significantly less and I'm embarrassed to say what it is 😂. Less than these follow up prices😭. 

I'm not completely sold on having packages as I feel it's hard to always give a number of treatments needed for one to get better. 

I'm wondering for those who raised prices after starting what did you charge before and after. What are some things to take into account? Was it hard to get patients in after the change in pricing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I went from $150 to $250 for self pay mobile visits around Nashville. It’s been so much better. I have less financial stress, which leaves me able to give more emotional energy to my patients. Plus, the brick and mortar insurance-based PT practices around me charge around $500/session.

> **Response 2:** Rather than packages, I offer a small “consistency discount.” If someone commits to seeing me 1x/week for 6 weeks minimum, I give them a 5% discount. It incentivizes people by having a small discount and it fills my schedule with more reliability than selling packages. 5% isn’t much of a discount but it always makes people happy 😃 and it’s not a burden to me financially.

For mobile PTs, for tax purposes, when you write off your mileage to patients homes, are you writing off mileage to and from the business, or just one way? Using the standard rate of .67 per mile for 2024.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding is that it depends on whether you log into your “home office” before and after you leave. 
If you don’t, then your first and last commutes are considered your “normal commute.” 
If you do, then you count the mileage. 
I almost always/ always check my schedule, my email etc in the morning and evening at the very least so I count it

> **Response 2:** In Canada it depends on whether you are incorporated or not. If incorporated you can have the business pay you mileage. You can charge mileage on top of your rate. Buu if you aren’t going right home you have to calculate approximately. Eg cannot charge both ways then see four clients as that would be overcharging. You can just raise your rate total otherwise it gets to be too much admin- have an ‘in area rate’ snd out of area rate

Does anyone have any experience offering Care Credit to their clients? A client recently asked if I accepted it but I wasn’t sure what it was. Looking into it further, it looks like it’s a credit card you can apply to finance medical expenses.

It doesn’t look like it would cost me anything to be a “provider” but also not sure if it’s worth my time applying and get approved. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I looked into it. Read the fine print. And check out the fee rates, they’ll take a pretty penny from you. You’ll have to decide for yourself, I got signed up and decided to never use it.

We grew by default and not design = restructuring. Has anyone gone through the process of transitioning 1099s to W2s, and how did you figure out their rate change, etc? Do you pay per visit, hour, unit billed? Do you offer a non-clinical rate to promote business development and community connection? I know where I want to go, grow and scale, just don’t know how to do it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good problem to have!

> **Response 2:** My husband is a labor and employment attorney and can speak with you if you want. This is very state dependent as pay is all about your local market as well as what is required to be paid or not paid tax and benefits wise. Also need to decide if your employees are hourly or salary—this would dictate meal and rest breaks as well as overtime.

Does anyone know how you can show your proof of income as self-employed? Like not what the business makes...what I actually pay myself. I use quickbooks self employed and use the profit first model and do owner's draws twice a month. 

I can see what I've withdrawn, but I'm wondering how I can generate a document for proof of income. Any ideas?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've used Canva to create a "paystub." I use Profit First and I had to show proof of income for something. They wouldn't take my taxes or PL sheet. The "paystub" showed my owner's draw in a more standard format.

> **Response 2:** You could make your business an LLC and pay yourself like an employee. Its a hassle, but probably the only thing that will be sufficient for proving income to buy a house. 

Talk to a mortgage broker & hire a CPA to help you for a few years to get the right kind of documentation. 

Otherwise...tax returns & back statements are your only option. 

Good luck!

I’m trying to get an idea of pricing structures for my cash-based mobile business. Mostly I will be offering services out of my jiu jitsu gym for our athletes. The gym owner is requiring a 30% cut which is not ideal but it’s what he is already charging other professionals to use the facilities so I can’t negotiate it. I train at a “bougie gym” in a relatively affluent area (Cary, NC). I am dry needling certified and considering offering DN only packages in addition to traditional PT POC. 

In looking at other cash-based practices in our region I could charge anywhere from $75-225 for an eval and given that 60% of that will go to the gym owner and taxes, I’m probably going to have to go toward the higher end of that to make it worth my while. But I am unsure how to price follow ups and DN/manual therapy only packages. Someone has mentioned to me charging by the minute or by CPT code but again, not sure how to price that and make it viable for me. This is a side gig for now but I’m hoping to grow it. 

Any suggestions? What has worked for you all?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe, depending on various state practice acts, you are protected against giving away a percentage of your income. For instance, when creating a rental agreement, you may be able to negotiate a fixed price (per hour, treatment session, whatever) rather than a percentage so if you change your rates based on demand, experience, etc the person renting to you is not further “profiting” off your degree & license. I would highly reconsider… I was in a similar situation with someone renting to me for a percentage but have switched locations where I now pay an hourly rent for the space and it’s a much smoother deal.

> **Response 2:** I would find a different place. If you are training at the gym and you already have rapport with people they will definitely come see you whether you are in the gym or not. 30-40% is not sustainable.

Hey all! 
For those of you who are cash based providers and provide super-bills for out-of-network reimbursement... riddle me this situation described below. 

Let's say you charge $100 per visit for your cash based services over the course of a 60-min session (unrealistic i know... but simplistic math). If i have a CPT Code based fee schedule of $25/unit and I typically bill 4 units to reach my cash based per visit rate... but i only see that patient for 3 units worth of treatment, and the patient payed the full $100 going rate for my treatment at the point of service. What will reimbursement from their insurance look like when the patient submits a superbill where the services performed don't align with total amount paid by the patient? Total cost paid by patient would be $100... total units billed to insurance for reimbursement would be $75 because of 3 units charged. Would this be a problem?

Side note... do a lot of cash based PT's bill off of a CPT code based fee schedule? Also do you bill units from AMA or 8-min rule guidelines?

Any information and recommendations would be helpful for myself as a new owner! Thanks all! I look forward to some great discussion below in the comments!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** But how does it work for patient reimbursement if your PP rate us $100, your billable are $300, check goes to the patient. They might be getting $200 reimbursement

> **Response 2:** Also, if your PP rate is $100, you opt to have the check to you, $300 is applied to the deductible?

RTM - what are pros and cons I may not be thinking of? Has it overall been worth it to your practice? I've read some of the comments on previous posts - trying to decide if it is worth it for me

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We just got back from the PPS conference in Austin and visited with several different providers that do RTM. One of the companies that is one of the most highly recommended doesn’t even recommend clinics do it unless they have 50 Medicare eval’s a month. ￼ From what we see, the majority of therapist in private practices have much more important things to work on and get flowing better before they add something like this that is not going to bring in a ton of money.

> **Response 2:** I have contemplated this, but I don’t like relying on patient compliance to get my reimbursement for a service that I have to pay for myself. 

It’s a great concept, but wouldn’t make financial sense for a majority of practices.

I own my own PT practice. I’m starting to informally teach one on one TMJ/Intraoral/head/face/neck self massage techniques virtually to other providers- PTs, SLPs, and OTs. 

Is the income I generate from that go under my business income? Or do I need to create a new business that is only for the profits I make from course instruction?  

Do I need my students to sign any legal documents?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Because the teaching you are doing is not a taxable service, you should be fine operating under your current business entity.  However, for "cleanliness" of it all, create a new LLC for your teaching business.  I would suggest asking your CPA, if you have one.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 2 months out of menisectomy he should be fine to return. 

I would have him slowly ramp up over the next 2 weeks starting with wedge shots and working down his bag as each day passes. 

We want to make sure he has appropriate hip mobility and ankle mobility to help take the stress of his knee. 

If he has full ROM, close to full strength and zero pain scores, let him send it.

I am thinking I need it under a new LLC since I take insurances on original location, but that means starting from zero, without reviews, traffic, etc. thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have no experience in this so take it with a grain of salt but I think this could likely be under the same LLC as a different service. Plenty of insurance based clinics offer cash based services as an adjunct and I don’t think they all have 2 LLCs.

Hi everyone,
I'm a cash based PT. I was recently approached by someone who wants me to treat them after a MVA (I am in an "at -fault" state if that matters). Is there a way I would be able to treat them and have them be reimbursed by the auto insurance company, or should I refer them elsewhere?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can treat. I would bill the auto. Not sure your state but most pay pretty well. Unless it's moved to an attorney's hands, and they have Med Pay or PIP, you should be good. Just call the auto case manager or adjuster.

> **Response 2:** Just be aware, sometime the insurance will end up paying the settlement directly to the patient(even though we maintained contact with the adjuster throughout the process) which may include the physical therapy services. It happened to us, but luckily the patient was honest and paid us after she got her settlement check and we were reimbursed 100% of our billed rates.

> **Response 1:** If their skills can bring in otherwise difficult to get business for other cheaper therapists then you can justify it.  Hard to do with PRN because they likely won’t be around consistently enough to build that business line.

> **Response 2:** You’re going to deduct taxes out of their pay though, so you’re really not paying them 60 an hour. Let’s leave it at 108 and 60 tho. You’re taking in 58 dollars a visit. Factor in cost of malpractice (shouldn’t be much, 10-15 a month to add on, EMR account, another 10 a month? Payroll?) you’re still making at least 25-30 dollars of passive income every visit no?

Hi everyone, I am a cash pay PT owner and have been approached by an old patient who would like to work with me under lien. 

I have never worked with a lien before. First question, should I explore this? Second, any tips that I should know going in? 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cash pay means that you get paid at each session. Do you go to the supermarket and leave without paying? That’s how I approach it.

> **Response 2:** I’ve treated many patients under an LOP with law offices. 
Positive: you will make more per visit for sure 
Negative: you will have to wait a long time to be paid. Could even be years, until the case settles.
The attorney will reach out to you and ask you to take a reduction. When I have done it, I’m billing twice Medicare allowable and then I will take a 20 or 25% reduction so it’s still ends up to be significantly more than Medicare. 
As long as not, all of your patients are in this situation, and you can wait for the cash flow, go for it in my opinion.￼￼

What is the going rate for dry needling since insurance doesn’t cover it?  Do you set up a separate case for cash when you’re performing this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I charge $50-70 if performed alone. Otherwise it is included in the price of my standard treatment visit and hour long session. I'm cash based

> **Response 2:** Just stopping here to say I am wondering the same! I know a colleague of mine charges $45/session but I’m trying to do in home PT and have dry needling as an adjunct if necessary and don’t really know how to separate it!

🎃 **Halloween isn’t just for the kids — it’s also our anniversary!**
Today marks **15 years** of Concierge Physical Therapists!

When I left my full-time PT job to start this journey, I could never have imagined it would grow into what it is today. Looking back, I’m not sure I could summon the same energy and long hours it took in those early years — but it’s all been worth it.

What truly makes this milestone special are the incredible partnerships we’ve built with like-minded physical therapists who share our mission:
💪 *“Your body deserves better.”*
Thank you to all our PTs that have been part of this along the way!
Here’s to 15 years of helping people move, feel, and live better — and to many more ahead! 🧡

Michigan PTs/OTs—I’ve started a cash-based home safety & modification business and am finalizing details before officially launching. I know we can recommend and set up adaptive equipment (e.g., shower chairs) but likely can’t install structural modifications (e.g., grab bars). Where is the legal line drawn for what we can/can’t install ourselves? Also, what are some modifications we can legally provide that might surprise us or that we may not have considered? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

Hello beautiful people! I Have a question, I’m trying to get a POC signed for a Medicare patient and it says in the script start date : 10/23/24 end date 4/23/25. Does that mean once the POC is signed, it’s good for 6 months?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The script is valid for 6months - meaning you can evaluate and/or initialize a POC within that window of time. Your POC is an entirely separate thing. You ask for what you anticipate needing within whatever length of time you determine it will take for you to meet the goals you establish.

> **Response 2:** A signed POC is required by MC, not a script. A POC can be good for up to 90 days, but you need to get an updated POC signed if you go beyond that. Below is a quick reference.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I work almost exclusively with runners and am part of a few run clubs. If you take the time to grow it slowly as an inclusive group for all levels it will flourish and you can promote yourself through it and offer services. I would strongly discourage charging any fees from the beginning just to be part of a group. 
If you have a local running shop I would start there for logistics or planning.

I have a question about address for mobile practice:  I’m planning to set up a business account tomorrow.  My PLLC/EIN and RA is my own address; however, I’d rather the business mail and location listed on website, etc be a PO Box.  Should I use the PO box address for the bank, or will the physical location be necessary? If I decide to be credentialed later with MC will address on my bank account affect paperwork?…Trying to plan the order of things as I’m chipping away at my to-do list with limited free time.😉

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My state would not allow the registered address to be a PO box, UPS box, or virtual. Home address was needed and then I was able to indicate a mailing address. Same thing with Medicare

> **Response 2:** You can have a mailing address with your Medicare application but will need to list your home as the practice location. Home base/administrative office only.

Is anyone a sole proprietor and using DBA instead of LLC? Or even another variant? How do you know which route to go?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You cannot have a DBA without first being some kind of entity. 

**EDITED TO ADD: I was wrong. Apparently you CAN file for just a DBA. Check out Sue Doyle's comment for more.**

For example. I originally filed as an LLC under the name Next Level Movement Physical Therapy and Wellness.

Then, because I was functionally going by this name anyway, I filed for a DBA to use the name Next Level Movement. Same business, same taxes, same everything, just an additional name I can legally go by. 

I have since changed to an S-Corp, and everything is basically the same. My tax number (EIN) and DBA didn’t change at all.

> **Response 2:** the DBA does not provide you with the same legal protection as an LLC. Also some states have different requirements for business structures for therapists. Check with your secretary of state website

So I started my solo practice a few months ago and have a perfect little space for it that I love. A colleague approached me and wondered if I’d be up for sharing the space occasionally with her. Just curious what would be typical or recommended here - do I charge her a flat per patient rate or a percentage?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Personally, I wouldn’t do it. What if you get busier and need the space during her times? Then you are stunting your growth and potentially causing a messy situation when you need her to move out.

> **Response 2:** Sorry, I can't answer for your question. However, 
Can you share a picture of your space if you dont mind. I am looking in to s small space and would like to see your setup.

Hi all— do any therapists here do PT or OT services on a “monthly subscription” schedule (vs charging per session or a packaged plan)? I have encountered MDs who are offering their primary care services on monthly subscriptions, and for a lot of patients, this is more affordable than paying insurance. Just looking to hear what people are doing in their business models to stay away from dealing with insurance. If you can describe briefly how you structure your services and why you chose that approach vs another, that would be very helpful. Thanks in advance! 🙂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes!

> **Response 2:** It's hard to do monthly like PCPs do unless you are offering wellness and prevention or you limit it to 3 months or so. Your also have take sure you aren't doing 8 visits a month for the rate a PCP would charge. PCPs are getting them for an entire year and our care is more episodic so unless you are going to offer other things or make it a wellness service, you will be losing out. PCPs charge $150-$200/month for unlimited access and visits. You need high volume to make that model work and typically our panel size doesn't justify unlimited access for that cheap a month.

I am starting my llc, and will be a 1099 employee/sole PT at a boutique personal training gym. I have zero experience with owning my own business, and feel like I have a steep learning curve as I'm still a fairly new PT, with my only experience being in hospital OP. 

The owner of the gym is an ATC, and I am happy with our agreement, where I am not leasing my space for a set rate, but we have a 30/70 split for each patient I see. With having access to a beautiful and well equipped gym, treatment room, showers, marketing assistance, etc, I am happy with taking home 70%. This will also be 100% cash based. 

Someone mentioned that fee splitting may be an issue, but I'm not seeing anything specific to cash based services. This isn't a kickback situation from physician referrals, and I am not dealing with Medicare. 

Am I missing anything? I don't know what I don't know at this point.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I know you are happy taking 70%, but want to throw out some numbers for you to think about. If you make $10,000 a month, you owe the gym owner $3000 which is a lot of money for your rent set up. You take $7000 but also need to pay taxes out of that $7000. I would run some more numbers to make sure you are ok with that income

> **Response 2:** Fee splitting allows them access to your books.  Have u thought of a flat fee per patient?

I’m wanting to work more with PI cases. I’m in the gathering info state so I’m trying to figure out how to set my prices and how to market.  (I’m aware you can’t have different rates/fee schedule; I’m a Medicare provider, not credentialed with any other insurances)

What is the typical rate reduction for auto accident cases when working on a lien?

Can you offer law offices a package deal, such as 6 visits for a set amount?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would reach out to the law offices. I have had several approach me as they are always having difficulty in finding people that will wait to get paid until settled.  That’s not something I am in a position or willing to do but you would be in hot commodity if you do.  I would advise to canvas that community and get an idea reimbursement wise.i would do “deals” as it’s not them paying the fee it’s the other ins company so charge your normal rate and do be it.  Good luck.
T

> **Response 2:** If you wait for settlements, u may be waiting years to get paid.  Offering law offices a discount sounds like it could be construed as a kick back.  Check your state laws.  Charge them your fee up front, then they get reimbursed at settlement.

Partnering with a gym that has many young athletes and they’d like to become credentialed with top 3-5 insurances of the area to maximize their physical therapy clientele.

You won’t have to bring in a thing. They’ll also have a self pay rate for those who would like to use it to their advantage. Decided to go with 70/30 for the beginning months and reconsider after 1 year agreement.

Curious to know if anyone has a similar set up inside a sports gym that’s wanting to bring in PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just a thought. Have you done any research on which insurances will be the top 3-5 you are looking to become credentialed with? 

Are they accepting new providers or are they “closed” networks? 

￼What is the average reimbursement with those payers - fee schedule or contracted rate? 

My practice is primarily in network and we had to turn down some contracts when we first opened because they were only going to reimburse us $40-$60 a visit with a￼ contracted rate. 

It might be valuable to find that info out out before you commit b/c it might not be worth your skill and time to accept those contracts. I also think negotiating for a set rent would be more strategic if it’s an option.

> **Response 2:** Personally, I’d never do a percentage split. Rent or no deal IMO.

**Hi!  How do you handle treating a patient who was involved in an auto accident (other person's fault) if you are cash pay?  **

**Do you have them pay up front and then the patient gets reimbursed or do you wait until it is settled and then you get paid?**

** If I make up a document for them to sign (other than basic intake form) what details should I include???**

**Any advice greatly appreciated!!! :)**

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If there is an open lien/case you have some options. The safest is just charge your cash rates up front and stick to your business as usual.

Another example/option, I have a standing contract with a PI group here that refers us cases, we see their patients and bill them on a net-30 at Medicare rates. Then when the case settles we get an additional agreed upon percentage. Has been lucrative so far and prevents us from being on the hook for the 8-14 months it takes for the case to settle but we still get a portion of the upside.

Cash based Colorado mobile PT here. I know this has probably been asked…I have a client who wants mobility/personal training for he and his wife in their home. Do you have different liability/consent forms for personal training services? Do you change your fees? Do I need to create a dba for just wellness? 

Thank you for the advice!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You don't need to change your fees if you don't want to. You're still using plenty of your PT-trained brain for personal training. 

You don't need a separate DBA unless you want one. Frankly I think that having two different names for your PT vs. wellness services is both unnecessary and confusing.

Joe Camoratto probably has more information to answer your waiver question.

> **Response 2:** Also in CO. I have two business for it but that’s because I want my wellness services to expand outside of CO. Up to you how you want it though! I charge my same fee (minus the eval fee for wellness). My consent forms are more general for wellness and I had an attorney draft them

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do a monthly membership for maintenance or fitness programming. They either get one 30 minute check in monthly to update/progress plan or 2- 30 minute check ins if they need more coaching…. The rate differs for 1 vs 2 check-ins. The membership is billed every 4 weeks and continues until they cancel.

> **Response 2:** I do them and have a three month minimum upon signup. Members get one visit a month for 60 minutes or two 30 minute visits a month, along with percentage off any further visits within the month if they desire it.

"I lost 10 pounds in a week! Looking to lose weight before the holidays? Message me "fit for the holidays" and I'll give you information."

True store.  I really have lost 10 pounds over the last week stuck in bed with the flu.

Does this type of hook (attractive statement) sound familiar? We've all seen it. I've done something remarkable and want to share with others how they too can have the unprecedented success they've had. 

Does it seem too good to be true? 

Does it make sense to lose 10# in a week? Is that healthy? 

We want your business to grow and we want you to do it in as healthy a way as possible.

Fast growth can happen. We've had seasons of ridiculous growth in the past and some has been healthy but a lot of our fast growth hasn't been that healthy. 

It's not sexy to tell people to grow in a healthy way but that's what we're going to continue shouting from the rooftops.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sustainable growth and laying a rock solid foundation are key! 

Keep teaching the right methods, your reputation and client outcomes will (and do) speak on your behalf. 👏🏼

> **Response 2:** Hope you are feeling better

**Original Post:**
My current job is perfect on paper, I really have no reason for leaving other than my dream for many years has been to open a pediatric clinic in my town. A space opened up right next to our pediatricians office and I can’t get it off my mind. It’s expensive for where I’m at in my private practice - just started mobile on the side of my full time. How do you make the decision on whether or not to take a HUGE leap of faith or play the safe route and build up my practice more before going all in?? Anyone have a similar experience either good or bad…?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s so tough! And I know it looks so different for everyone as each families financial situation is different. 

Personally I was able to find a fitness studio to rent from during the day and it has been amazing for getting started. I have only worked part time for the last 3 years so we weren’t financially counting on a full time salary, but starting out sharing space with a studio has given me so much peace of mind. It’s allowed me to be profitable from the beginning (even though it may have been minimal per patient to start). But the ability to open without losing money for the first few months has been so nice. I opened in November, have saved up enough in the business to cover me if I was suddenly off for 6 months and have taken home a solid paycheck the last two months. But I really attribute it largely to having rent that has been less than $500/month. I could have easily been paying $1600 a month and lost money in most of my early months.

> **Response 2:** I have the same dream- to open a pediatric PT clinic and there's a need in our town. Its a hard decision and only you can answer your question.  Ask yourself why do you want to do it. When you get that clarity then you will be lead to the right path...then you'll know which step to take. Uncaged has helped me in this process.
My business is 1.5 yrs old. I started mobile while still working PRN for 6 months then went full time mobile. 
Best of luck to you and God bless!

I’m an OT with a solo mobile outpatient practice. If I rent space from a PT in his clinic and continue to operate and function independently under my own LLC and we refer patients to each other will this violate anti kickback statutes?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following up on this post: rather than paying a set monthly rent, we discussed me paying him $x per patient visit to use his facility and equipment so that I’m not losing money during slow months. So monthly cost would be variable. I’d be paying that set amount per patient regardless of if the referral came from him or someone else. Thoughts?

> **Response 2:** Nope. 
Probably the only way you would be in violation would be if you each received compensation for referring the patient to the other.

What’s up everyone. I am relatively new in the group. Don’t comment much/post but really value everyone’s expertise and following everyone’s stories.

I am in beginning stages of my side hustle. Still work full time for an outpatient hospital based system. Got my LLC and am currently operating out of my home. Have 1 client at this time. Goal is to work up to 4-5hrs/week starting out and scale from there.

Reason I was reaching out to everyone is I am meeting with a local gym owner this Friday about possibly renting some space there. Does anyone currently practice out of a gym setting and if so do you have any recommendations/insight on the process of negotiating. I’ve watched some videos/podcasts but was interested in hearing from you all and if you don’t mind sharing what you paid starting out especially if you didn’t have much clientele built up. 

Price/month, /patient, etc. or whatever you did.

Thanks so much! Any and all feedback would be appreciated very much! Have a great day!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Joe! I practiced out of a gym for a while, ended up shifting to another location because the accessibility/parking at that gym really limited patient's ability to get there. A few things I'd recommend...if you're keeping your volume small for a while like you mentioned, commission-based pricing is okay but in the long term you want a fixed rate. Even $10/patient may seem small but if you're up to 30 patients a week suddenly you're paying $1200/month so that will backfire unless you make it clear from the get go that you'll do commission short-erm up until you start seeing X patients then switch to a monthly fee. Remember that you're a big asset to the gym...you are helping them be more marketable and that should reflect in a relatively low rent - I paid $700/month which included full access to the equipment and a private treatment room. They also gave me the first 2 months free to get myself set up and get clientele in the door which was a massive help.

Make sure there is adequate parking and it's easy to get to. Due to my experience, that would be a deal breaker for me.

Do workshops at the gym. Volunteer your time 1 night a week (or charge a small fee for the workshop, either way) while you're getting going...present on things they want to hear...how to improve your overhead stability...how to lift and strengthen your back...how to improve X mobility for X lifts...how to strengthen your rotator cuff to avoid shoulder pain etc etc etc...

Private practice while working for insurance based company. 

I have a cash-based private practice that I work weekends and some evenings. I still have a full time job at a larger insurance based practice. This week at my full-time job, I evaluated a patient and scheduled follow ups.  I spoke her her the next day and she told me that she was surprised that her eval was $400.  She was never told the expected outcome of pocket by the authorizations team or her insurance. She found out she is covered for PT at 50% AFTER a $3500 deductible.  So each session will likely be $400 which is not doable for her and she said she will have to cancel all follow ups.  I suggested that she could find a practice that is cash based so that she can continue treatment at an affordable rate. She asked me for suggestions multiple times.  I told her she could probably Google pelvic PTs. I am the only one in the town I work in. The closest town (which is also across state lines) is about 45 minutes -1 hour away.  That is where I live and have a cash based practice.  I don’t want to conflict of interest or look like I am soliciting.  So should I just tell her to Google and let her figure it out… Or since she asked for specific practices, provide her with a list of several to choose from and include my practice on the list?  Again, she decided to cancel with my insurance based company due to the high cost. Then specifically asked for recommendations in the next closest town which is about an hour away and in a different state. So are there any issues with giving her options including my cash-based practice?  At this point, my practice is not public knowledge with my current employer since I practice in a different state an hour away and do not directly compete since I am cash-based. Advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it is definitely a conflict of interest to take a client from your employer and move them to your cash based practice. 

I never ever see a client privately who i met at my employer without disclosing that to (and getting permission from) my employer. 

Agree that $400 for a PT visit is insane. 

If you can't disclose to your employer, I would probably just stop communicating with her. 

If she finds you on Google and reaches out to your personal contact then you have to decide if you feel ethically OK to accept her as a client.

> **Response 2:** I would provide her a list but not include my own as it’s a conflict of interest. If she finds you on her own then no problem.

I need some help! I created my PT business almost two years ago. Last year, I handled my Virginia state registration fee through the Virginia SCC ($50 fee). I just started receiving emails from 'US Filing Services (Virginia Compliance)' telling me that my I need to file my VA state registration fee within 30 days. Is 'US Filing Services' just a company that is trying to handle it for me and charge me a boat load more ($150). I can't recall doing anything through 'US Filing Services' before. Thank you in advance.

Does anyone have resources they use to generate passive income or other ways to build passive income? I’m waiting to get my PLLC approved and am working to build things up in the meantime. One of my mentors suggested creating “products” so I’m not always trading my time, but I’m not sure where to start

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Start with what you’re already good at teaching.  Leverage AI or someone on your team to help you package some of your services into a product (I.e, book, online course, online community, etc.) 

2. Affiliate programs. It doesn’t have to be healthcare products. There are plenty of businesses that will pay you for promoting their products if customers buy them through your affiliate link. Think of items, courses, or even books you’ve used or currently use. See if those companies have an affiliate program.

> **Response 2:** I joined the Mastermind platform to start making courses using my knowledge and about accessibility and travel planning. I felt like that was the easiest route for me to create something that will hopefully stay evergreen. I also feel like not many things are truly passive income.

Good moring , got a call from a group home with 5-6 people needing PT. One has Medicare (I am contracted with) others are on Altec (Arizona long term care) which is a branch of Access.
The Access/Altec patients are willing to pay cash. Can these patients pay cash? I thought Access patienes couldn’t pay cash for for medicle services .  can their family memebrs  pay for their PT  cash and not go through insurance? Thank you for the guidance .

Anyone out there with experience doing group home PT?

Anthony Maritato

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not sure about cash-pay question/insurance rules in this instance but we work with many group homes in Scottsdale/PV. They are great sources of patients and makes scheduling very easy, no commute between patients, mostly Medicare.

Would recommend you lean into the group home world if it’s a demographic you like!

> **Response 2:** I don’t know what Access/Altec is. Is it a Medicaid plan?

Looking for self employed recs for dental insurance plans for my family.  We have health insurance already in place through MediShare.  We were on cobra for dental but that is now ending. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A lot of dentist where I live offer their own plan that you can pay for that gives typical cleanings and discount on work done. That was my family’s plan before getting back on an insurance

> **Response 2:** Medishare has dental discounts included, I believe. We ask for cash rate for dental though, because its been cheaper than paying a plan.

Has anyone worked with a sports team as their PT provider? We’re currently talking to a semi pro team about this and I’m not quite sure what to offer. We were thinking of offering services for the whole team for a flat monthly fee, but we didn’t want to run into a scenario where so many people need treatment each week that we can’t accommodate all of them. We are open to other types of offers as well but this was just our preliminary idea.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think you would be best served to negotiate a retainer rate of a certain amount of hours per month at X cost, with option to review after 2-3 months

> **Response 2:** Yes, as their OT provider. Private pay. I do flat rate hourly fee. Never had any issues. I do only see a limited amount of players in a week. Most of my guys like 90 min- two hour sessions at two or three days a week. To see a whole team maybe 5 therapists would be needed or less therapists and shorter treatments. The more flexible you can be, the better.

Question for the group...
Background: I am a cashed-based PT. I have a gym that I work out of but also offer home visits. 
Situation: An acquaintance of mine would like me to come see his mother in her home for PT. She just had a knee replacement. She is doing PT at a physical therapy clinic. The plan is for her to continue therapy there but supplement with me. The primary purpose is she has pretty advanced dementia and can't remember her home exercises and can't remember to do them. Her children are all very busy during the week running their own companies. She does have aides. However, the aides do not feel comfortable helping her complete her home exercises. Her children are willing to sign an ABN.
Thoughts? Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can’t use an ABN if you are not contracted with Medicare, but it can totally be a service you offer for a self pay rate.

> **Response 2:** My thoughts are first, medicate will not cover the extra visits per week and you could argue non skilled as you are taking the place of a family member. Either one of those reasonings alone would make this non covered service. I would feel comfortable offering this but you can decide how you feel about it. No ABN needed but I would be clear about there being no attempt to recover costs and all self pay.

Looking for some guidance here.

I had a company contact me this week saying they were managing a worker comp claim and looking for a provider for a patient in my area.  I told her I only do cash pay for patients who don’t have Medicare coverage and she said that was fine, they could pay me my cash pay rates, I would just need to use a “1500” form and fax my notes to them in order to be reimbursed.  Then she said that it would take them “no more than 45 days” to process my claim and for me to get paid for the visits I provide. 

So my question is, is this how workers comp usually works?  Can I expect to get paid for this?  Since it’s such a long turn around for payment for this I just want to look into the legitimacy of this before I start seeing this patient and provide services for 6 weeks and then find out their not going to pay me. 

Does anyone here have any experience with workers comp?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had one WC case.  Yes took awhile to get paid but their rates were great, way more than Medicare.

> **Response 2:** They have a nice fee schedule.  In my state us get paid in 2-4 as weeks

How do you figure out what a comparable salary is for an employee vs a contractor rate?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Assuming payment model is the same, so looking at hourly versus hourly or paper visit versus paper visit, a fair contractor rate would be 1.075 times the fair W-2 rate. 

Now, if you are asking about the difference between pay per visit 1099 versus salary W-2, that’s a tougher question and it’s going to depend on a few things, namely stability of the caseload. Generally speaking, by taking someone under a paper visit model versus an hourly or salary model, you are ensuring yourself against declining caseload, and you have to pay a premium for that insurance In the form of increased labor cost

> **Response 2:** Start out with whether you can legally hire a contractor or not before you deal with rates.

How did you all build your referral bases for niche populations? I work mostly in neuro and geriatrics. I've heard mixed things about showing up to doctor's offices. 

Does anyone mind sharing startup costs with creating their LLC and getting started with their business?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I made a postcard or flyer type thing and went around to every relevant provider’s office, including therapy places that don’t offer my specialty. Some worked out great and I started getting referrals and built relationships with them. Others were very awkward and uncomfortable and I never got any referrals from them. But you have to take the good with the bad. And don’t try to talk to providers. That makes you look like a menace and a solicitor. Just say that you want to let them know that you are now offering such and such service in the area and you’d love to be able to help out their patients. Or something like that. Hand them your flyer and leave.

> **Response 2:** I have my NCS and own a mobile outpatient practice specializing in neurologic conditions (now two full time employees). Happy to share some things that I did for building referrals if you’d in that population base. Location and healthcare systems in the area may play a factor.

Hey guys, I'm leaving my job at the hospital. I'm one of the only two specialists here in my field, and I get referrals from the same providers.

I was thinking of emailing them to tell them I'm leaving. Should I mention that I'm starting my own practice so they can refer to me later? There aren't many of us, and I want them to know I'm still around. I'm just worried the hospital might see it as soliciting, you know? I have no clue.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would wait until you are gone and in your new practice. Then reach out to let them know where you are. Most hospitals won’t want you to tell providers where you are going while you still work there

**Community Responses:**

When opening your own brick and mortar practice, curious what most people did. Did you just go for it? Or did you research, organize, and prep a lot.
By organize, I mean like everything down to equipment needs, how people will clock in and out, hours, dress code, etc. 
by just go for it, I mean, start seeing people and figure that out as you go.

Off-topic..

My employer wants to being implementing Iontophoresis in our 8 outpatient clinics. Can our providers simply “order Ionto” and my PTs can then administer Dex (that’s kept at each location) or does each patient have to be prescribed the medication? (Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas)

Sorry for the random question, I’ve never used Ionto and have a meeting with “IontoPatch” in an hour.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** in my State, thevdex is prescription and each ot supplies their own.  technically, they are supposed to being and take meds with them.

> **Response 2:** Each patient has to have their own prescription and you can keep it locked and secured in your clinic. 

However I did work in TN where it was ordered at a urgent care/PT practice and kept on the PT side.

Cash-based OP ortho clinic owners - I’m a solo practicioner looking to bring on my first new hire but find myself struggling to determine salary/pay structure. I’ve considered percentage of sales, tiers based on patients per week, bonuses based on yearly number of visits, etc. 

I find myself having a hard time finding the balance between fair pay and not giving up too much money. 

Who’s been there and what did you do?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you!

> **Response 2:** We do W9s for everyone and set it at 65% revenue generated.    We are hybrid so insurance clients they got much less.  Cash clients and other services such as shockwave etc they got quite a bit more.   I wanted to keep everyone hungry and happy    Little did I know. They just made so much compared to their previous jobs they got complacent quick.   Not with treatments. Just wanted to reduce hours available.

For those that use Jane, how much is the physio track monthly cost? I swear I saw in some posts here it was normally $12, but with Jane discount it’s $8/month. But I must be mistaken because their instant quote was $19 on their website at minimum. Just starting a business and embarrassed to say that $19 + Jane’s costs are too much without any patients/income. SAHM with no budget for this new business yet. 
If you use Jane and have a cost effective work around for HEPs, I’m all ears…Thank you!

Pen and paper - my go-to tbh. Its more sacred to the patient when i sit there and manually write it out

I have a brick and mortar practice AND work a part time job. 

I have enough private patients on my waitlist to quit my job now, but I’d be working more and making less than working my job (I’ve been doing it 20 years and am very well compensated).

To make sense I’d have to charge $157 vs the $135 I charge now. 

I am thinking of raising the price to $160 to all new patients (the current ones will eventually phase out), and wait until I am fully booked at new price before I quit. (Mainly because I am on the scared side, and think I will be too scared of changing prices and not having a caseload AFTER leaving my “safety”. 

At the same time I see everyone on my waitlist and feel I need to get out and see them. 

Thoughts? 

Ps: I did quit my job once already a year ago, to realize insurance pays would not meet my financial needs and have to return to my job to be able to ease off insurances.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Or…you could be treating half as much and making double (still working a lot at first for sure though) Not sure where you are but here around Boston most clinics are charging around 250/hr including my practice. Unless you’re somewhere that cost of living is extremely cheap I would put my money on it the local plumber might be charging more than you right now.

> **Response 2:** A few questions: 
1.) what made you start your part-time gig? 
2.) how long is your waitlist at present? Time in for eval/visit? 
3.) have you raised prices before? 
4.) is your goal to move completely to your part-time gig and ditch insurance? 
5.) how much more work would you be taking on by making the switch? There’s a lot of things that can be taken care of through automation of processes that take a lot off your plate. 

These are all questions I ask ppl that I mentor or are on the fence. The initial fear of not having a “consistent” paycheck is real, but you can end up making more in the end with far greater flexibility. In my area, $157 is far below market value for a cash-pay visit. So I would do a little research and see how your prices compare to other providers in the area. 

Then make your decision 😊

I have an independent contractor who will be doing home visits only.  I've incorporated an increased rate per hour to reflect the travel charge.  She will get a percentage of what is charged.  Obviously her price per unit or charge code is higher than mine in clinic.  Can I ethically do that or do I need to charge the same, and then add a travel fee?  I offer people superbills, is it unethical to charge more per unit (technically) bc of it's in the home or does that matter?  Hope this is clear, thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So, if Medicare, you cannot charge a travel fee.

 If private pay, I'd bake a travel fee into my session cost say
In clinic is $x/hr
In home is $x+20/hr 

For superbills, you could have your fee schedule set for the more expensive rate, and give a facility discount for those in clinic. I know "time of service" discounts are often used for cash rates that are lower than insurance billed rates.

> **Response 2:** If she's a 1099, she can write off the mileage herself on her taxes, so I would stick with a higher percentage of net. For example, if MCR reimburses $100 for a daily visit you could pay her $65-70/visit. Obviously, you need to cover all your expenses. But, once those are covered, then you can decide how aggressive you want to do it. I think Luna pays $65-70/visit (1099) in my area. I would also make sure she is educated on the differences in reimbursements for the various codes so she can charge appropriately. Let her see how those differences affect the bottom line, and ultimately her bottom line.

Hi everyone! Do you have any resources on how to calculate a “pay per visit” rate vs a “pay per hour” rate? I am thinking of adding some PTAs to help me with my regular visits with the goal of making it a full gig in the future? Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you cash based or insurance? 
If cash, then you should have a Rate per Session that is flat.  Then you decide how much of that rate you want to pay the PTA.

Any￼ suggestions for small business checking account with no minimum balance or fees? I’m starting out small.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'd also suggest a local bank! Mine is no fee and covers atm fees so can use basically any ATM if needed. Also nice to have actual people to talk to if I have issues vs. calling some call center that is not helpful.

How are you setting up your fees for dry needling sessions?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am curious on this as well. I’m also curious what a decent dry needling fee is for most clinicians? I was thinking of having it as part of my normal session, but also offering as a separate “a la carte” offering for those that just want dry needling.

> **Response 2:** As a cash based provider it’s just included in my session rate. I don’t charge extra the way I don’t charge extra for cupping gua Sha, visceral etc.

Advice! I’m ready to start seeing patients on a cash basis for a side hustle - ultimate goal will be to be solely on my own and out of corporate world. 

BUT I’m struggling to see how to get it to leap from side hustle to full time without that big income lag. We literally cannot afford for me to not have my income during any period of time (husband a teacher, two small kids, building a house…) How do you do this!?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started mine on the side as well after I switched to PRN from full time OP. Due to the natural fluctuation of business, I still do PRN but the roles have reversed. PRN is now the side gig and my business is about 70% full. I have kept prn for security when I have slow months…this is my situation at 1.5 years in. Organic growth takes time, so if you can manage building it on the side for a while, that may be best until you have consistent and more predictable business income

I see there is a lot of information available on this, but reading up on it shows there are a number of important variables to consider. 

I just got off the phone with someone who would like me to work with her and her son, both of whom are covered by their auto insurance (Farmer's) for an MVA in November that was not their fault.  Her understanding is that Farmers will then sue Geico (the at-fault driver's insurance). 

I am a mobile, out-of-network provider in Washington State.  I do provide Superbills, but collect payment from the client.  What are the steps I or this prospective client should take to ensure they are reimbursed for my services?

What other tips do you have for me?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** initially their PIP would cover not just your fee, but any medical fees incurred from the accident.  since mva in Nov, that mo e may be gone thru ambulance, MD's etc.  PIP is usually 2500-10K.  after PIP exhausted, payment would then come from ins carrier or patient.  atsettlement, everyone gets reimbursed. including ins carriers and any attorney fees.  I would provided your normal fee for service with super bill or hcfa form provided for pt. for reimbursement.  you could also file these with auto company and their private carrier.  in my state, it must be hcfa, no superbills.,

> **Response 2:** Start with reaching out to the adjuster. They will tell you what they reimburse per visit. Then the client will have an idea what they can expect to be reimbursed.  That’s where I would start.

Curious if anyone is raising their rates in 2023 and if so, how much?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If your supplies, rest, or any costs of doing business is going up, then yes, you probably should consider it.  If your turning a good profit and that margin isn’t changing much then no you shouldn’t.

> **Response 2:** I am increasing $10 a visit in the new year. This works out to be about 6% increase. I have had zero pushback from patients that I have notified so far. If anything I have had several patients tell me they are happy for me that I am charging more because they know how expensive everything is anymore. Everyone's situation is different and you have to do what works for you.

Hi all, just finished reading through the uncaged book package and I have a few questions. To those using the Jane app for EMR, do you also use their credit card payment processing? In the checklist, square is listed as preferred. They have comprable rates per transaction. Does anyone have a reason they like square better? Also, charging a fee for travel is not addressed. Are people building a general fee into their overall price? Can we not charge for travel if we write it off on taxes? I’m sure it will vary state to state and I just recently moved to northern Nevada. Other northern Nevada mobile PTs, what travel fees are you charging? Thanks for your time and help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use PT everywhere and their built in payment processing is basically the same or less than square

> **Response 2:** Where are you in northern NV? I live in So. Idaho and we sometimes have people that have to commute up because we are the closest clinic.... I would love to connect!

My husband & I are looking at relocating in near future. Based on some work opportunity research (he’s a physician and I’m a PT) & our personal interests research, we are considering NC or CO in mainland v/s Honolulu. Comparing these options. Currently, have my concierge & telehealth practice in CA. 
I’d really appreciate if any of you PTs here who are PT business owners and/or employees in these states and are willing to chat with me for more information work related opportunities, growth, need for PTs, business friendly laws/regulations, insurance credentialing, and a summary of overall lifestyle, pros/cons. I can only find so much info online and reading statistics and realtors but I want some profession specific info apart from overall from you guys. Any input, thoughts, feedback or DM me is greatly appreciated!
Thank you so much 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I didn’t own my practice until I moved out of NC, but lived there for 6.5 years as a PT and unlimited direct access laws are one pro of being a PT there. It’s growing quickly, especially the research triangle area, but still better cost of living than many other states, and there’s a good pipeline of PT schools in the area and generally people wanting to move there, which is good if you’re hiring.

> **Response 2:** I worked in Colorado (Denver metro) in a hospital. 
1. We LOVE denver/Colorado. The weather is amazing, there is anything you could want to do, the mountains of course, such an active lifestyle state. 
2. Denver is EXPENSIVE. housing is ridiculous, daycare is ridiculous. 
3. Pay can be less. I was told by my employer (and many people are told the same), “the mountains/the Colorado lifestyle is part of your benefits package 😑 not really if it’s difficult to afford cost of living. 
That being said I’m sure there is a huge market for mobile or small business PTs. There are a lot of successful people who would be willing to pay cash/more if they get better. I will say there is an overwhelming amount of PTs, because of multiple PT schools, and of course the active lifestyle so it is definitely over saturated but I’m not sure what the indep mobile/small business looks like. We left January 2019 because of husband job opportunity and cost of living/daycare but our goal is to finish paying off loans and go back with kids out of daycare!!

How many handicap parking spaces do you need. The building is ADA compliant. How many fire extinguishers do I need. Where do I post emergency exit routes. That kind of stuff.

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yea, as soon as you register with the state you will get all sorts of junk mail about what you listed above, and then also tax ID (even though you already should have an EIN through the IRS), and lots of different scams to send money through the mail. You don’t need any of it, and don’t send anyone money through the mail

𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐚𝐲 🇺🇸

The unofficial start to summer. 😎 ☀️ 🏖 

A day that we pause and remember those who gave their lives and their freedom so that we may have ours. 🙏

We recognize those who currently serve for their bravery 🙌

It is also one of six days during the year that we look forward to because we get to have those days off!

Or, we hope to be lucky enough to get to have them off.

With the weather getting nice, today would definitely be one we would love to be able to spend it with our family and friends.

However, those days off are not always guaranteed. 

Question ☝️

Are you finding yourself looking forward to those six days out of the year when you can finally take a break - aside from the two weeks that you take off?

Do you feel defeated when you aren’t the one lucky enough to stay home and chill? 😖

Everyone else is enjoying the pool, a mid-day BBQ, playing cornhole or tossing the baseball ⚾️ around.

Except you.

You’re working.  Doing charts.  

Half of the patients will probably cancel - because they are celebrating the anticipation of summer’s start.

Meanwhile, you can literally hear the clock ⏰ as it goes TICK ……. TOCK…..

And you’re thinking “I just want to be home with my kids!”

If the clinic happens to be closed, it just means extra work for the rest of the week. 😩

I know. I was there.  For years.

Until I started my own practice. 

Exactly NINE YEARS AGO TODAY!

And my very first client?  I’ve been seeing her every Monday morning for those nine years!

Why did I start it?

For days like today.

I hated watching the calendar 🗓 and counting down the days until I could get that one extra day off.  

Now, I’m in control.  

My days off aren’t determined by government appointed Mondays. 

And, by NO means, am I minimizing the meanings of these days like today - Memorial Day 🇺🇸🙏

But I determine my days. 

And, you know what?

You can too. 

But I totally get how scared doing your own thing can be.  And, honestly, it’s NOT for everyone. 

But if you are having those itches, I’ll share these quotes with you:

“Failure is failing to try”

“Faith is willing to risk failure”

𝘿𝙤 𝙔𝙊𝙐 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙘𝙝𝙤𝙤𝙨𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙈𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝘿𝙖𝙮, 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙇𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙧 𝘿𝙖𝙮, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙮 𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙮 𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙨?

You can.

Hey everyone, have a unique situation where a client of mine is looking to have me travel with them for a good chunk of the year. Doing a mix of PT / personal training / health and wellness. Totally negotiable and everything is up in the air. Any advice on how to proceed with this? I typically charge him $150 for in-home sessions. 

My first thought was to use an annual fee that would encompass a reasonable amount of sessions at a higher than normal rate, and have stipulations to include reimbursement for travel costs.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would think a daily rate for each day you’re gone (including travel days), then an additional fee for each service during their trip, and full payment of all travel costs, including meals, transportation, and lodging.

I had one new lead ask if they could have a payment plan. 

While I decided to do this or not, I just had five leads call willing to pay my full cash pay price! 

I decided to value my time, my services, not chase down payments and decline the former 

Especially since I work with “older” populations and would hate to bother a family member for lingering payments if their loved one passed away before it was paid in full 😩 

I’m so glad I spent a few days to decide! What are your thoughts on payment plans?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They can use a credit card for a payment plan if needed. I think your decision is a good one.

Has anyone successfully managed to charge a small fee per visit (admin fee, tech fee, whatever you want to call it) in addition to billing insurance for one on one PT visits? This would be primarily for carefirst patients, not medicare.

If so, interested in how you rolled it out, getting patient buy-in, managing greivences, dealing eith insurnace/legality …whatever you have to share!

We want to continue to provide execllent one on one care (45 min sessions) & we want to allow patients to utilize their insurnace benefits. However, with rising costs and dwidling reimbursements, we have to bridge the gap somewhere.

Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Make sure it is not construed as balance billing.  I have a friend who is suing a PT practice for doing this.

> **Response 2:** Ask a lawyer

After three years of mobile and specializing in neuro I have a unique opportunity to partner with a Functional Medicine, MD as well, practitioner that specializes in movement disorders and dementia. This would allow me to keep my mobile practice because it's a niche and needed in my area but also have a gym setting as well. 

We have found side by side offices so we would be together but separate. Without me going into too much detail, I would love people's opinions on pros and cons of taking this leap. It would be $2,000 a month for 2000 ft². I am in Savannah, Georgia and rent is steep, but I haven't negotiated it yet so I can ask for a lower rate if recommended. 

Thoughts??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Compared to San Francisco that’s a great rate! 🤷🏻‍♀️

I heard a very powerful statement not too long ago...

"*The fastest way to not get to where you want to go is to try to get there on your own*."

That hit me like a charging elephant in the middle of the Serengeti.

You don't have to take my word for it, but I have seen it time and again those who try to go it alone struggle, burn out, or both.

Dreams and desires, when big enough, *are *challenging.

I am almost 100% private pay but I do have a couple of workers comp situations where the company has essentially hired me to work with their patient, I send them a monthly 1500 form and invoice, and then they pay me according to the state fee schedule for worker's comp. This morning I got a call from a third-party company asking to settle my bill for four treatment sessions last month for about half of what my rates are. The fee schedule pays more like 80%. They said I didn't have to accept. I thought it was so weird. There has been no correspondence as to any problem with the services and the sessions are already authorized by the adjuster. ￼Has anyone else experienced this and if so any wisdom that you could share? ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Refuse the negotiated rate and then they’ll send you your actual payment. Just a money saving tactic on their end!

> **Response 2:** I send a letter in reply stating that I will not accept less than fee schedule and include a copy of the fee schedule if it’s easy to do so. I’ve always eventually been paid at fee schedule.

Hi all! I am PT and own my own mobile practice. I also offer wellness services and have been asked to do chair based Pilates, balance classes, etc at independent living facilities. Was just wondering if you all had any guidance on what to charge for this type of “group” fitness service - for a 30 min or 45 min class. The facility would pay for the class (as opposed to each participant paying a fee) 

Thank you so much I appreciate your help! I am new to this and feel comfortable with my one-on-one session prices for PT, but just wasn’t sure the going rate for group fitness.

**Community Responses:**

Who do you use for processing virtual credit card payments from insurance companies? I currently use Square and pay roughly 3.5% plus $0.30 per transaction.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Quickbooks. 

Don’t know the fee off the top of my head but probably not dramatically different from square. Edit: 2.9% + .25/transaction

How often/what amounts of cc checks are you getting? I get maybe $500 a month from Medicare secondary payors… so pay maybe 20-30 bucks in fees. Could I shop around and save 10 bucks a month? Probably. But not worth my effort.

> **Response 2:** Your local bank or credit union will often have the best rates, but stripe is lower I believe. Just steer clear of PayPal.

Looking for some insight… Working towards opening a mobile neuro PT practice. For those of you who also treat under this umbrella… 
1.) How much do you charge your clients for your evals and how much for subsequent treatment sessions? 
2.) Is your current rate the rate at which you started your practice under? If not, at what point did you increase your rate?
3.) If you offer treatment packages, what do those look like?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have my NCS and am PWR! certified and have my own mobile neuro focused practice. Being that majority of my patients have Medicare, I decided to enroll in Medicare as we are unable to charge cash for formal physical therapy services. I do offer cash based physical therapy for those with private insurance and have a few that I bill as an out-of-network provider. I have not changed my rate yet as I feel those who have neurologic dx their income is typically fixed and I will most likely be seeing them over the course of a long period of time. I also offer cash based wellness services after I discharge patients from formal PT services. I'm happy to speak more regarding my practice if you'd like.

> **Response 2:** I know this isn’t what you asked but I will say I haven’t talked to a successful cash mobile provider who didn’t wish they started at a higher rate. 

There is no benefit to filling your schedule with low price treatments. 

Your goal isn’t being busy. Your goal is helping people. 

$200 or more for any home visit might be a reasonable minimum. 

It is always easier to start high and discount than to start low and raise.

Those of ya’ll that bill OON:

How do you bill patients with high deductibles without their wallets getting absolutely murdered by higher charges? Do you cap your max charges at your self-pay price? Does that fall under the “Good Faith Estimate”? I want to bill a patient with UHC OON, but my billing team said my reimbursement would be almost double my cash-pay price of $170/visit and considering the patient had a $5000 deductible they eat all of that unless I’m mistaken which I certainly could be.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can't undervalue what you offer. I know it's tough, but have the conversation with them and just be honest. Tell them that going cash will save them money in the long run. We are OON with UHC, as well, and I just had this conversation today with someone. She elected to go cash and see me because we have a relationship and she values my honesty.

> **Response 2:** Be consistent with your policies and your billing. Make sure they are written out and then put them in the Good Faith Estimate. This includes what your normal fees are, your prompt pay discount.

Have some thoughts about this from both as a DPT and a financial advisor. Much to consider.

I have a mobile practice that I co-own at 50% with a colleague. I have been approached by another old colleague who would like to join our business and said that she can likely bring clients that would follow her from an old job that is in the area. We do not have a huge amount of clients in the area (where my business partner, PTA resides) but are growing, so the most I could offer her as far as visits would be an IC situation currently. I would definitely love to have another PT to cover and work this this area though, so I could focus on continuing to grow the area closer to where I'm living. I guess where I am struggling, is what would make this deal "worth it" to her to partner with us vs. just starting her own mobile practice in the area? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Multiple “owners” makes this stuff such a headache.

Bring them on as a contractor. They get the benefit of autonomy. You take a % since you have all the systems set up. They can leave if they get unhappy and don’t have to worry about any sort of company equity. Everyone wins

> **Response 2:** Ask them... 
Have a dialogue with them and see what are their intentions goals values etc.

Hey everyone, happy Friday! I have had my own clinic (cash and private insurance) for about a year and a half now. I rent space out of a gym and am looking to move to another gym that I align with better. This new gym has a vision of having 5 locations and this is an opportunity to grow with them. I would still rent space out of the gym while being able to use their equipment. The new gym is about 15-20 min drive from my current location.

With that said, has anyone moved from one location to another?

What was your transition plan?

What is the process of changing your address with BCBS and can you have 2 addresses during a transition phase?

I appreciate all your help and insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congratulations! 

We are moving our primary location for a third time in 3 years because we are growing so fast. And now we are also adding a second location too. 

For BCBS, you need to first log into CAQH and add the location. You can have two locations, so just add your new one, leave the old one as your primary location and then the next time you reattest switch the new one to the primary location and delete the old location.

Step 2: log into Availity and go to payer spaces, pick your local Blue Cross, then go to provider enrollment, then choose either individual or group depending on what you are and then select change address and fill out that application. Takes up to 30 days to process

I’ve had a side business as a sole proprietorship for a few years. At this time I have a college who would like to start participating in the clinic and would like to become a partner. 

What are your guys experience with this? Would you recommend a partnership? Or should I bring them on as a independent contractor 

There is a piece of equipment that we both want (3D running gait analysis) and they are willing to pay half, hence the potential partnership. I can afford the full cost myself but it stretches the budget thin

Any advice would be great! Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a business partner and love it. But we started the business together and worked together prior to that. I don’t think buying a piece of expensive equipment together is a reason to start a partnership. If you have other reasons besides that, then it could be a good decision, but I don’t think purchasing a piece of equipment is reason enough. ￼

Hey everyone, who is seeing patients in your own home? How is your setup?

Debating home visits, versus my home versus a lease, at least to get started.

TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are seeing Medicare they will do a site visit.  Everything has to be up to snuff there.

> **Response 2:** You really need to look at your local zoning and home owners association rules (if you have one). Often a small shared professional office might be a way to go.

Hi all,

I am finally ready to start my cash based cognitive coaching and dementia and communication advocacy business. I reside in CA. I am unclear if I need to register as an LLC or Scorp.

I’m thinking about starting a staffing agency. I feel I already do so much of the work and communication when selecting and securing a contract for myself and still get such a small cut/low balled. I know that’s not the full story and a lot more goes into it,but I’d like to start to consider it an option. 
I want to advocate for therapists and give them a cut of the bill rate they deserve. More than that, I want to build something- grow something- and be able to make an impact on the community I so strongly support. Any ideas on where to start? Has anyone started their own staffing agency that would like to drop some pointers or give some guidance?

**Community Responses:**

For those that take insurance, do you take payments after services using the estimated patient fee or wait until it processes? 
I’m contemplating switching to charging 24hours after due to some Insurances taking several months to process…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Collect before treatment. For those where I don’t know the exact amount, collect an estimated average.  I tell the patient we will keep it squared up as we go along so occasionally they will see a few dollar more or less than the estimate. No one has given us any trouble over it.

> **Response 2:** If you are In Network.  The estimated fee is just a co pay or co insurance.  Now collecting est fee with  deductibles is a good move.  Especially with 2026 deductibles resetting

What is hourly rate for contingent PT who is interested for few hours in week to help out with treatments only in my clinic set up.
Not sure so looking for market rate ( Ohio state ) 
Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not sure how much you charge per physical therapy appointment or what the market is in your part of Ohio, but some of my friends pay their PT‘s roughly $100 per appointment that they see… and that’s not just in Virginia where I am. That’s looking at several states.

> **Response 2:** Should be percentage based, every market is different. Example Bay Area could be 3-4xvisit vs rural Alabama. Business wise check out indeed in your area PRN and give 10% more. If you want to grow with them 50-60% of visits.

**Community Responses:**

I own a small cash-based practice and have hit my break even point (well, I’m less than 1 treatment session away…).  When it comes to paying myself a salary from my practice, what do I need to know? I don’t want to hire a payroll service for myself alone.  My business has a dedicated checkbook.  Is it kosher to write myself a check from that checkbook at ‘said salary?’  Or, do I need to follow a more formal process for legality?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, you can pay yourself form the checkbook as an Owners Draw. Then connect with your accountant to find out at what point in revenue/profit you need to transition your business structure and drawing as a salary

> **Response 2:** I was there a year ago. You need to scale to unload yourself. If you don’t you’ll be stuck until you quit. Virtual assistants are where it’s at. I have 6 that work for me full time for the price of 1 in person employee. It’s pretty amazing.

**Original Post:**
California: our healthcare worker minimum wage is going up to $21 per hour starting June 1st. How does this affect small private practice physical therapy clinics? With constantly decreasing reimbursements and constantly increasing costs of doing business in healthcare, I am utterly discouraged as the small profits we get keep getting smaller. How have you or your company handled these challenges? We are mostly insurance based and the demographics in our area will not strongly support a pure cash based model. I want to keep our staff employed but our aides currently make around 17 per hour. Giving them 4-5 dollar raise overnight will definitely impact us, as we will have to pay higher payroll taxes on top of the actual raise. Aides apply for the job without much experience or training at all. Paying them $21 per hour as a new untrained healthcare worker seems unreasonable but that will be required starting June 1st. We tried to see if we can apply for a waiver but cannot find info on how to even apply. Any help, thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Simple . Don't hire unskilled help, there is EMR /AI and online assistants that can do that most work, and with the savings , pay the therapist /pta more and add the scheduling to there plate.

> **Response 2:** Tough Situation.  I was a PT Aide ions ago.  It is an entry level position.  Not a 44K per year job.  My First PT job was 18.26/hr + Bennies.  I guess there are two fundamental choices.  Increase volume/add ancillary sources of revenue or cut the Aide hours/week.

For people still “employed” in healthcare… do any of your employers express concern for either or both of the following occurrences. Also, do you feel the system is addressing this??? Or concerned??

**Community Responses:**

Rehab departments can all do part A and leave all part B to me! No more monopolizing the retirement communities. Let the residents shop around for quality therapist they like.

Hey gang, I'm hoping to get some feedback from the group about a scenario I stumbled into. I have been doing home health and concierge so I don't have any experience in outpatient billing. 

Recently had a meeting with a chiropractor that a patient referred me to. The chiropractor is interested in me coming into his office to treat his patients. He will not charge me to use his facility.  My rate is $200 per session for my concierge patients. The chiropractor said that his office could bill and pay me my rate. He said he hadn't done enough research to determine the exact specifics yet. Is it possible to be reimbursed by insurance for $200 for 4 units? His office does SOAP notes. 

What do you think about this? What other sorts of questions should I be asking?
Thanks for your feedback.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** He is NOT likely to get your rate in reimbursements..so get paid as you go not when he gets reimbursed 
And
Oversee the billing maybe by signing it
And
Do your own notes

> **Response 2:** Nope, he won’t even come close with 4 units but who is doing the documentation??  Shady clinics have been known to change the billing to way more than what a therapist originally put in.

Does anyone have a financial agreement for clients to sign? And would you mind sharing? I’m a cash pay practice and looking for verbiage in how to state that they agree to have a card on file and that card will be charged 50% of the treatment fee if there is a late cancellation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I see what’s posted but I would also suggest you have a separate cancellation policy agreement & charge agreement form that is signable & printable if needed. It should really cover you to say that the card on file is accepted to be charged for any vists that are cancelled inside of X hours/days &/or for no shows. It also helps to have the wording of what your business charges show up as on their credit card statement. You might want to add language to cover yourself in that the person will be responsible for any & all fees related to any chargebacks or disputes. There’s growing issues with people disputing things that are not actually charged anymore but it can take time for the bank (not the credit card processor) to catch up to the dispute file & can be a mess for a business owner if the client is being dishonest. You also might need a card on file agreement (which the card is actually filed with the payment processor & not you directly) if you’re doing that to be able to run these types of charges.

> **Response 2:** I’ll post one here

For the mobile therapists, do you collect payment before or after sessions?  Has anyone had a problem with patient trying to not pay after a session?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Nope, they always pay. I have them sign all financial agreements beforehand. Explain the cost up front, so no chance for misinterpretation

> **Response 2:** If I know there is a copayment collect at time of service. I use IvyPay for that. Also accept check or cash. Not had a problem yet.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** It’s not just the rates. It’s the total 💩-show hassle of actually getting paid. Even if the rates were improved, I’d have to have a lot of others telling me they got paid in a reasonable time without a ton of hassle or multiple additional requests. It’s so dis-heartening what a mess we are in.

Has anyone here worked in home health before? What did you like or not like about it? Any tips or suggestions for success when working on your own?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s been great for me as I build my cash business. Flexibility, night before scheduling, choose how many people is see, get to volunteer in my kids schools. You go from mansions to hoarder homes, it’s eclectic but overall I’m happy I did it. I started 6 months ago after 12+ years in outpatient setting so was transition for me! Documentation is kind of brutual but once you get used to it and we use scribe service it’s more doable.

> **Response 2:** Oof where to start haha. 

I have worked home health for 6 years. I work PRN for 3 companies now. At first it was great; higher pay than the hospital at pay per visit. I lived in a city where patients were close together so drive time wasn’t bad, could see 8 patients a day easily. Documentation wasn’t terrible but longer than most settings. 

NOW 6 years in…I have never received a pay raise. I ask often and try to demonstrate my value. But PRN is a hard rate to increase. I work more rural now since moving to my current city. More drive time, less patients, lots of time where I’m not being paid. The documentation has drastically increased in the past years. 20-30 minutes per patient now. Insurances delegating how many visits we can have. Lowly motivated patients. Poor home environments. All parts of home health. As a supplement to income PRN can be fantastic. But even I’m burning out on it. Large companies seem to care very little about the actual clinician. I’ve had 6 nurses quit in 2 months with 2 of my companies. Burnout is high. 

I will be staying PRN while starting my mobile outpatient and it will be fantastic to have more steady income. But it has been pushing me out of its own system the past 6 months and I’ll be happy to leave.

is anyone in network with Aetna?  How is their fee schedule?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We dropped Aetna. Their intermediary is Holista. They pay us $35 a visit if you see patient for 10 visits. If you see them for 20 visits, then it will be $17.5 including patient's copay. They pay like DRG. For RC tendonitis, this is how you will be paid. Aetna does not manage new providers. Those that were providers 2 years prior have better rates. Do not accept without asking how you will be paid. If you see patient beyond 3 visits, you may not sign up with them. You can not bill patient for extra since you have contract with them.

> **Response 2:** They aren’t not a good payer in Texas… at my current employer they pay about $60-70 a visit.

Contracted PTs, would you mind sharing the structure of your contract- it doesn’t have to be all the details but the general arrangement? 

Are you paid per billable hour, per hour worked, per patient, % of billed amount? 

What happens if you don’t have any patients on a contracted day? 

Do you like the arrangement or wish it was different? 

Do you do any of your own billing? Are you billing under your NPI or the facility you are contracted with? 

Do you do your own marketing? Are you paid to do your marketing? 

Thank you in advance as I start to explore the world or hiring a contracted employee.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi,
I am paid per treatment/eval. So if treatment is 45 mins then I get paid the same as 60 mins. If I get no showed I get a lower rate (think almost minimum wage) rather than no pay. Last minute cancels are something I’m still working out.  Prior to being full time here I was picking up hours here and there so I never had any cancellations or no shows so this is new to me. Im in the midst of getting another per diem job to supplement. In addition working part time as a server cause it’s fast and easy $. I don’t do marketing (yet) but we will see how things move along. 

Personally I took this job for more flexibility and shorter commute so if I don’t have any patients I just take the loss and remember it’s not as stressful as it was at my last job and just stay home and catch up on errands, etc. once student loans restart this will probably be a different conversation

Quick question about Medicare self pay with ABN: I’m transitioning a patient to self pay in the next several weeks. As far as self pay rates for Medicare beneficiaries, is there a requirement that I charge the Medicare allowable rate for whatever CPT code I would be performing? For example, I plan on just doing exercising and kinesiotaping, and I’ll probably be there 30-40 min. Do I have to bill the equivalent of 2 or 3 units of the Medicare allowable for therex?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #Compliance #ABN  "transitioning"  - what does this mean?  

Is the beneficiary completing their medically necessary POC? 

If so discharge patient and setup a "wellness" or "exercise" program.  A mandatory ABN is not necessary, an optional ABN is recommended (read instructions relative to therapy). 

Are you "stepping down" the frequency, w/beneficiary requesting to maintain frequency?  If so, issue Mandatory ABN (coded to claim) to transfer liability to beneficiary.

My strong suggestion - review ABN instructions (both ABN general instructions and ABN therapy specific guidance).

As for billing for Mandatory ABN - guidance in the instructions - Medicare does not dictate price, only HOW price is stated. Setting rates best practice....?? 

As for billing Optional ABN - Medicare does not dictate rates.

For ABN - always use #GoToSource information - for both ABN and therapy application of ABN. 

Best of luck.

> **Response 2:** If you are seeing a Medicare beneficiary and doing something that is skilled you cannot charge cash for that service.  If it’s a non skilled service you can and charge whatever you want.  
If you have no relationship with Medicare - ie they don’t know you exist, then there is no way for you to bill Medicare in which case charge whatever you want.

Hey everyone! In need of a CHT in the central Maryland area for an 18 year old lacrosse goalie with possible tendon tear. Going to college to play goalie!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** He's not a part of Uncaged, but I know there's a CHT who works in the Columbia Hopkins outpatient location (I know his wife who is a PT, I can get his name from her if you want). Hopkins does hour-long one-on-one appointments.

I’m considering starting out as a sole proprietor. For those of you who did, at what point did you decide to convert over to an LLC?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The LLC is there to limit your liability and protect you personally. There are different designations for an LLC, such as a sole proprietor, s-corp, and c-corp.

What you may be asking is about when to change to and s-corp or c-corp for tax purposes based on your business.

Hope this helps.

> **Response 2:** What Paul said above. I did it immediately to limit liability not so much for tax purposes as I was a single member LLC and that's a disregarded entity for taxes (rolls right into personal). SCorp classification of LLC is useful after a certain revenue is hit

On the to-do list for opening my own practice there is the EIN and the state tax ID number. Could someone explain the difference of these? Also the EIN is free but the tax ID is a one time fee of $250. Is that correct?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is essentially a tax ID for businesses. You shouldn’t need a separate tax ID as a tax ID will be assigned to you for your business when you file for an EIN

> **Response 2:** It may vary by state. I just have an EIN and no state tax ID

**Original Post:**
I am curious if anyone has done this business model in the uncaged clinician group. Currently there is a 1 month wait for traditional OP PT in my area with many people complaining that the it is too long of a wait. I see people here and there on the side with my full time job with the government. With so many PTs out there wanting to be their own boss has anyone done a finders fee approach? For example if my company markets to medical providers that we can get their patients in for PT in one week, the PT I hire then sees all of them as they will colllect the total amount they bill through my company but then pay rent/finders fee for all the referrals I send to them? I already have a small space in my house or garage to charge rent if anyone is  treated or needs mobile PT. 

A big personal training gym I ran into does the same approach. They charge rent to all these personal trainers to use their facilities and they go out and hustle to get their own clients and build their business within this facility. Thanks for the advice.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I get so many referrals that I’ve been thinking about this

> **Response 2:** One time I covered for a therapist who was on an extended vacation and she had some clients that needed an emergency session. The therapist sent her client my info. After I did the session, like a week later when she got back in town, the therapist asked me to pay her the entire service fee and then said she would give me 30%. The problem was she did this after the woman paid me. I had no idea there would be a fee or what not. So I’m sure you can imagine this model isn’t so favorable for me. I actually refer people to my colleagues for free. Everyone comes back to me but I want them to get the help if they need it. 

What I have been doing instead: 
Emergency wellness services, where it’s a walk in basis and services are 3x the price. If urgent cares can do this, so can I. I started doing this because I had multiple clients say “can you just cancel someone? I’ll pay 4x the price they were going to pay.” So now I designate a couple days a month for this. I’m still working out the logistics with my own practice. But I think this is the answer I’ve been looking for so I don’t have to turn people in need away.

**Original Post:**
I’m an OT and have a sole proprietorship. I have a contract for BCBS but the bulk of my patients are cash paying (more for personal training services.) I’m toying with hiring a contract PT to work VERY casually (2-8 patients/week.) If I get her a BCBS shield contract, how do I manage billing and paying her? She will get 70% of my cash rate charge. Do you also think it should be 70% or whatever she’s billing (will be substantially more.)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have done this in the past and I was paid a flat rate per patient. I was happy and so was the employer! Can you talk with the person to see what they think is fair?! Your cash rates might be higher than what BCBS reimburses, but I never like being incentivized for what I bill out. I like to bill what the patient needs. Just a thought!

> **Response 2:** I'd do a percentage of your average reimbursement/cash pay per visit looking at the past 6-12 months.

It’s TIME to fully bring the UNCAGED APP out into the light! 🌅

Guys and Gals, this can be the grassroots change that our profession needs…

We, at Uncaged Clinician, believe this could change healthcare. 

Our voices are louder and our impact is greater when we come together. 

When you have an APTA membership, it feels "out" there...as in you are paying a fee for OTHER people to combat the problems our profession faces.

We want to change that.

We want to put YOU, as the clinician, in the drivers seat to help drive change in our profession. 

This is going to change the game for all of us.

We would like to personally invite you to join us for our Uncaged APP Launch party. 

Details: Wednesday, March 22nd @ 8pm EST on Zoom

It's free to come, but limited spots. 

If you are serious about helping to make a grassroots change to our profession, then we encourage you to get signed up!

If you could meet and exceed your family’s income needs with sales of online courses only (no in-person treatments), would you do it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'd want to do both. Online course sales generating survival income, patient care generating the "above and beyond" income that lets me actually get ahead and serve better.

> **Response 2:** Wow. I take these results say something about our collective burnout as well as our desire to maximize our efficiency so we can be with our families more. Anyone agree or disagree?

Thanks!

⭐️** Weekend Reflection: Celebrate the Wins!** ⭐️

This week, we’ve seen so many clinicians take steps toward building the practice they’ve been dreaming about — whether it’s finally getting clarity on their ideal clients, launching a marketing plan, or just showing up consistently for themselves. 🙌

Even small wins matter:

👉 Answering that one tough question
👉 Booking a first consult with a new client
👉 Finishing a task you’ve been putting off

Take a minute this weekend to reflect: **What’s one win you had this week, no matter how small?**

Drop it in the comments — let’s celebrate together. 🎉

Remember: consistent action + reflection = long-term growth. 

Keep going. Your dream practice is closer than you think. 👊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Set a record in patient visits this week at 47 visits with 5 more tomorrow 🥹

> **Response 2:** Opening a second location in 2.5 weeks and also found my next perfect hire after searching almost a year for an OT to add to our PT practice 😀

I have a mobile vestibular practice and was wondering who has turned a room or rooms in their home into an office/clinic space and can share the pros and cons and steps needed to do so. When I am officially an empty nester, I will have 2 rooms I can use. One as an office and the other as a gym space. Using my garage is not an option. While I love being mobile and not having rent, I wouldn’t mind not having to drive all the time. I’d maybe have 2 days in clinic/home and 2-3 days on the road. Thanks in advance for your input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hello Shana, I first started my practice out of my home and have since moved it to a separate location. For me, having the business out of the house was great in that I was able to start the biz with minimal overhead and never had to worry about “making rent.” It was also convenient to not have to travel. That being said, it was not a longterm fit for me. For one, I was not comfortable with strangers coming to my house which limited my clientele. I also realized I really did not like having clients walking through my house (like you, garage wasn’t an option). As far as steps needed, I believe that depends on where you live but I had to get a home occupancy permit which was pretty straightforward where I am. Hope this helps and good luck to you!

> **Response 2:** I did it for a while and would love to go back to it but I have all my mom goodies in it.

**Original Post:**
Hi all,

I’m trying to get a feel of what can be expected/possible for independant clinicians/practice owners in the NJ area. 

Im still a staff PT, but i’ve been considering starting my own practice in the future. Just want a realistic picture of what that can look like in terms of salary/earnings with overhead costs, insurance, cash pay, etc. 

I understand that it brings freedom and flexibility, but the money is very important to me lol.

Thanks!

Edit:
I currently work in outpatient ortho/sports about 5 years out from PT school. I have my DN cert and am also a Pilates instructor. 

Ideally, I would love to have my own ortho/pilates clinic. But unfortunately for me, all of that equipment is so expensive on top of rent/lease prices in NJ. I am open to the idea of doing mobile visits as well. 

I am late 20s female and do plan on getting married, buying a house, having kids in the next 5 years. So it is all very daunting to think about 😣.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s honestly varies so much based on your target niche and what you want the business to look like.  

We all want and need money to survive and keep the lights on. So obviously that’s nothing to sniffle at. 

But, many others would agree.  First tell us what your perfect practice looks like. Then reverse engineer it.

I just started my own practice in NJ (pediatric PT) and am wondering if I can legally hire an OT and SLP. Where can I find this information? I am starting small so don’t have an attorney, only an accountant who is in NY so is unsure of the laws here. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We consulted an attorney a few years back and were told that one needs to have a partner from another discipline in order to provide these services. I’m not sure if it’s still true.

> **Response 2:** You should be able to.  What MIGHT be a little tricky is if you are established as a PLLC.  But even then, I THINK that you can still hire a different discipline.  But that different discipline can not be a partner in the business.  

Consider this: 

There ARE practices in every state that have all disciplines, so there IS a way!

It's hard to fix bad habits once you've created them but it's also hard to invest in coaching proactively so people try doing things on their own until they have a major problem. Just another reason that I'm so excited for the Uncaged Community and App launch party this Wednesday.

**Community Responses:**

Definitely document and in general be consist across all clients of skilled vs unskilled services and reasoning of medically necessary vs non covered services.

Question for practitioners in Virginia...Do all LLC's have to file an annual report? I'm getting mixed answers. Also, I used ZenBusiness to get my company up and running. I chose to use them as my agent because of an offer with a discounted rate (not using them again this coming year). They are saying that they will file my annual report for free (included in the package). However, they are trying to collect $50 in order to file the annual report with the state.  The Virginia SCC website says it is free to file. 

Thank you in advance for any insight y'all have.

Update - I just tried to complete the annual report on my own on the Virginia SCC website but I received a warning say that I was not eligible to do so. I'm even more confused now.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in Virginia and have only ever just paid the annual $50 registration fee. Google says Virginia doesn’t require LLCs to submit an annual report. Also beware of getting text messages asking you to pay the fee via link. Only pay the fee via mail or online through the SCC website.

> **Response 2:** No I don't

Anonymous because others in this group know me and I haven’t given my notice yet
Trying to decide about renting space in another town.
I currently rent space for $400. There is one other in my smallish town who do what I do. I take Medicare only and others are 100% cash.
I still work hh at 50% capacity. I am 90% booked.
I am ready to quit hh. my concern is consistently booking.
There comes question:
1/3 of my caseload comes from a town 40 min away. They don’t have anyone like me there, and even PT, they only have 2. 2 referral sources there consistently refer me people and always talk about how I need an office there because a lot of people they refer are not able to come to my town during day time. But would see me if I was in town. Cheapest office I can find there is $500/m
I am wondering if I should open an office there 2 days a week. I know I could fill 2 days a week and would provide consistency but that would be only 10 sessions max since my work is such I can’t see more than 5 a day and there is no one else trained (yet) to do what I do.
so not sure it is worth it? Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it should be based on what you want personally. I have made some decisions because I felt like I should and it’s hard to not be resentful over time. If you want to provide that service to that community and add the commute and cost of rental, then I think you should.

> **Response 2:** Just depends on your ROI.  I have 2 offices about 75 min apart.  One is way busier than the other.  I pay bills off the slow one and live off the busier.  The most frustrating thing you can do (I've been there) is just work to pay bills you wouldn't have if you didn't have an office.  If there's a good profit do it if not don't.

Update on lawyer post:

So originally the kawyer had reduced our amount to $2500 and $1500 for husband and wife. Which we emailed back saying we accepted those amounts.

Then the husband came to our office and asked for reduction in our fee.

I spoke with the husband and told him there’s nothing we could do and it would be fraud if we reduced our amount for him to get more money back.

Well a few days later the lawyers office send us a check for $500 for the husband and $900 for the wife…..

I emailed the lawyer and asked what happened to our original amount.

Here’s what they said: After speaking with my clients looking at the medical billing, you billed Medicare for all of Mr (husband) visits and some of Ms. (Wife’s) visits.  Under Medicare rules, providers are not allowed to balance bill patients.  The payment of $500 represents Mr. (Husbands) copays.  There should have been a separate check for Ms. (Wife’s) in the amount of $900 for the visits that were not willed to Medicare.”

I have no idea what to even say. I’m so pissed. We charged the wife our self pay rate because she was not on Medicare. So I don’t understand how the lawyers office can reimburse us Medicare rate…. 

And for the husband, they only covered his copay and NONE of the dry needling….

“

Here’s the old post for people to read:

“I saw a husband/wife post MVA, and I treated them for a few weeks. We just received payment for their settlement. And it’s a good amount. 

Now the husband came into our office today and asked to lower our amount. The lawyer showed them what we were getting from the settlement and the husband came to us and asked to lower so they can get more from the settlement.

Kind of sucks. And I’m not sure what to even say or do. I don’t mind lowering the amount.

And I did treat them together and not separately because that’s how they would want it.

Wife was very sensitive so wasn’t able to do much as for treatment. But husband I did a lot of dry needling and manual on. Husband was saying we didn’t do much on his wife so we Shouldnt charge much. Etc etc. 

This is also ironic because I know them to be very well off.

Any advice?”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Balance Billing does not apply to 3rd party payers like auto/personal Injury.  Once the case is settled, MC or private pay is supposed to be reimbursed, but u are do your full fee.  I would get your own attorney or take these patients to small claims court.  From now on, for these auto/P.I., I strongly recommend collecting your fee upfront and let the patient and attorney deal with all of the above mentioned B.S.  This will effectively weed out those  clients who are just gunning for a settlement.

> **Response 2:** Also, I’m only billing for my dry needling which is not a covered service. I’m not billing our self pay rate or anything like that for the husband.

And the wife didn’t even have insurance. So we billed our self pay rates. She got on Medicare towards the end of treatment so we didn’t charge our self pay rate for that.

I am a relatively new mobile business went full time is Feb. Have been doing Medicare and Cash.  I have someone who reached out that is 77yrs old and has been on work comp since 2008.  He said he was getting weakly PT for years until COVID through work comp.  My questions are…..does work comp pay well?  It it worth it to try to do this?  Is anyone willing to do a phone call with me to walk me through the process of who to take him on if it is?  
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have 2 work comp pts - each different companies. One is really easy to get paid and the other one is crazy. I work with the nurse case manager and the adjuster (now work closely with the billing manager for the latter company 😜) and keep consistent lines of communication with authorization, clinical documentation, etc. I am otherwise fully cash practice (SLP + Executive Function Coach) They are more time consuming than other cases but have been good consistent income. The pay rates are not bad, I believe vary state to state - I am in MT. I just submit a 1500 form each month and an invoice. Also gave each company a W-9 in the beginning. Hope that helps!

> **Response 2:** There are different companies with different fee schedules.  In MD, IWIF is the big one and they pay very well.  In my state, it is also illegal to charge a wc patient cash for services or anything pertaining to the wc injury.

**Original Post:**
Hello! I have a mobile therapy practice and have brought on ATP specialist to do wheelchair and seating assessments in the home. We are negotiating pay. She is contract and my intention was to pay per units billed, like my other staff, but she mentioned being paid for documentation since it takes significantly longer than a typical eval/treat. I have no problem with this, but I want it to be fair while also ensuring that the practice still makes some sort of profit. This is a new venture, so I'm wondering:
* Do other practices pay for doc time after wheelchair assessments, and if so, how much? (Not necessarily a number, but is it at 100% of their hourly treatment rate? I'm considering a percentage of her hourly rate since if it not revenue-generating time).
* If you pay for documentation time, do you cap it at, say, one hour, or do you have the clinician tell you how long it took?
* Speaking of, how long is a reasonable amount of time to spend documenting a standard wheelchair assessment? (We plan to use a version of the Houston Methodist Hospital fillable form).

Thank you in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have done custom seating myself at part of my practice and I charge the patient more (cash pay) for these sessions because of the documentation and time to set up demos and coordinate with vendors. 
It does take time and effort to put all these pieces together. But also an experienced therapist who has their APT should not take long to do documentation. One hour tops even for a complex eval.  Straightforward evals take much less time, like 20-30 minutes.

> **Response 2:** IMO if you’re paying per unit, documentation of those units should be included in that pay. I.e agree on price per unit/visit/whatever and make it all inclusive and save the hassle.

Shall I pay for each visit or for each referral? 
I'm a cash based home Care PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** tell nurse you will take great care of the patients,  you'll be a resource for patients or for them,  you'll help patients find right providers from a trusted directory you have created,   ask patients to share their own feedback on your care/service with referral source when they go for follow up visits, this is the stuff that holds value in healthcare relationships and is legal and extremely valuable to you as a provider

> **Response 2:** Any kickback is illegal in Healthcare.

Is it possible to create an “estimate of cost” bill for a client to give their insurance company prior to services actually being rendered? This client has Samaritan’s (actually a medical share program, not insurance). And she thinks they will reimburse her for her cost of therapy prior to the sessions actually occurring. She has paid for a bundle package and has the sessions all scheduled. I’ve never been asked this and I’m not sure how I would document it in a way that would satisfy the medical share company.

Reimbursement Question: 
I had a patient ask how they would receive insurance reimbursement if they paid for services out of pocket using their FSA card.  Will it be received the same way as if services were paid for using a normal credit card?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I see a cash based provider, I pay in full with my HSA card, and then I submit the superbill and my insurance reimburses my HSA if it was a covered service. 

I pay $55 for a chiro visit, my HSA gets reimbursed $15 for the visit because that's what they "allow" 

It's a pain in the tush, but it is what it is. 😉 

As the consumer, I'm doing the leg-work to get some insurance coverage instead of having the provider do the work.

> **Response 2:** A person puts money into an FSA for the purpose of spending it on medical services.  I'm not sure why they would expect to get reimbursed for spending their money?

Question for those who do aquatic therapy, specifically group. How are you managing the billing? And how is reimbursement rate for you?  

Is it self pay or are you able to bill their insurances?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I did my 1st rotation at an outpt with aquatics we did group for Medicare and 1:1 for private pay

> **Response 2:** Aquatic therapy is a risk activity; Group therapy is a risk activity. Know the payor rules, know the code definitions, and setup "monitoring" activity as part of the practices Compliance Auditing & Monitoring Plan.  🙂 

As for CMS, there is also published policy on "pools" depending CMS enrollment (private practice v. rehab agency).

**Original Post:**
I had a lymphedema trained therapist approach me wondering if I'd be interested in bringing her on ~10hrs/week but exclusively for lymphedema care. For those of you who do lymphedema, how do supplies get covered? Is that something the patient typically pays for or would I need to partner with a DME supply company and eat that cost out of my margins? She didn't know, apparently that was all handled by back office staff at her last job.

She says her typical practice pattern is 2-3 units of manual 97140 + 1 unit of either TherEx 97110 or self care 97535. Less commonly 97760 for orthotic mgmt. If that's the case she'd pull in ~10-20% less revenue/visit than is typical for our other patient visits and if supplies come out of my margin, I'm not sure it makes financial sense to pursue it.

I bill MCR/MCAID and OON all other payers if that matters.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have worked in an outpatient setting and now on my own as a lymphedema/oncologist OT. It has always financially made sense for the patient to buy either bandaging supplies or compression garments- it’s also the psychology of the patient buying into the program. It’s cheaper for the patients online to order if the therapist helps determine what the patient needs. Like it was said in previous comments, once the Lymphedema Treatment act goes into effect, patients will hopefully have better coverage (commenting period is going on until August 28th).

As for billing, it depends what your current clinic offers and how you bill. What the therapist is proposing her typical billing sounds about right. You definitely won’t get rich with lymphedema therapy, but check your area because there’s generally a great need in all communities with too many patients to serve and not enough therapists

> **Response 2:** Ive worked in a large hospital based clinic for many years. We started with clinic providing supplies but ended up having patients pay for supplies because of cost. We found a DME provider that will order supplies and ship them to patient (we just filled out order form and sent to vendor at eval). Some insurances do cover supplies so this particular provider runs benefits and bills accordingly. 
I've recently started a mobile practice and do not plan to provide supplies because of cost. This may be a barrier because of OOP costs for the patient, however, the lymphedema treatment act goes into effect Jan 2024. At this time, we don't know what will/won't be covered but hopefully it will provide adequate coverage for supplies and garments.

Hi- I am a pediatric OT cash-pay practice. I am wondering how others go about charging families when you are treating twins or triplets. Do you still charge your normal hourly fee for each child? Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Peds clinicians might have different input, but I treat adult couples in their homes occasionally. I might bounce between patients (15 min with the husband, then with the wife, back and forth etc for a total of 1 hr each), but since I give them 1:1 attention each time while the other one is resting, I bill for normal 1:1 rates. 

If it’s more like “group therapy” where all the pts are doing the same activities simultaneously, then a group-based rate might be appropriate.

> **Response 2:** I usually offer a slight discount for the sibling(s)

I’m a mobile provider but going to start seeing a few clients out of a gym. How much do you pay the gym owner per hour or per client that you are there? I’m located in southern NH. Thanks for your thoughts!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Many will say to NOT do a percentage, because as you get busier then you will continue to pay more - but I think a percentage with an agreed upon max or cap is a smart move.

> **Response 2:** I’m in Concord and we agreed upon a percentage up to a max of $500/month. I just did the math of $500/160 (full-time hours for a month) to get an hourly rate of $3.12. However, I consider 20 patients/week full for me so I doubled it to $6.24/hour.

What would you charge for exercise programming? 

I also see personal training clients (typically non-medicare or Medicare patients who are well beyond therapy discharge)  and I'm trying to navigate how much to charge. I'm seeing a client today for an assessment and then he would like exercise programming for a few months. I will likely program a month at a time with the opportunity for weekly check-ins, and for him to message me with his feedback on the workouts, etc.

I'm really stumped with how much to charge. I know there are personal trainers out there charging $500 a month for a service like this.  

 I'm still struggling with this as I continue to navigate into the cash only space.  I've clearly been conditioned by our crappy health care system to accept crap pay for my skill set and trying to break free of that mindset. 

Any input appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on your time with them. Whether it is exercise or teaching won’t matter. . Go by 30 min intervals

> **Response 2:** I would echo all the above. What are YOU worth and what would make YOU happy from a charge standpoint? Then, estimate approximate hours to serve the individual and you're set. 

Don't look at anyone else or feel like you missed out on potential pay/feel like you're charging too much. Personally, I feel as though I am worth $200-$250 per hour. 

Sometimes I feel like it's a lot until I see others charge $350-$500. I got $250 because that's what my lawyer charges. They are the best in their field and so am I.

Hello! Are any of you out there mobile therapists working with older adults with UI.  It looks like there is some research on transtibial and presacral TENS being beneficial for urge UI.  Are any of you doing that?  If so, are you getting results?  And what machine do you have?  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Laura McKaig Any insights?

> **Response 2:** Yep!

I like the really cheap ones and just make sure I can adjust the pulse rate so that I can set it between 10-20hz. Gotta read the fine print. Something like:
"Pulse Rate: Adjustable, from 2-150 Hz, 1 Hz/step"

If they can use it independently, I have them purchase one. If I want to supervise them, I bring a machine each visit.

Obviously, I follow all estim precautions and contraindications. :)

**Original Post:**
As an idependent contractor for a rural outpatient clinic, I’m thinking I can inform the clinic of an increase in my IC rate change and allow them two weeks notice. I’d like to add a 7-10% increase in my rate. It hasn’t changed since 2020. 

I did request a raise several months ago, but was told it’s not possible due to one of the clinics that are overall not bringing in a profit. I drive to all of their clinics, though mainly needed at that one.

They gave me a single/temporary bonus at the time.

The business owns multiple clinics for 2+ years. They also have school contracts and hospital contracts. I know they need to maintain my employment at this time. I know my productivity is profitable. 

Instead of asking for a raise (like a W2 employee would), as an IC, I’d like to stand my ground and set my own rate.

This is a reasonable increase in rate. 

I am working my own business, but not more than 4-8 hours a week. Thankfully, I created for myself a boost to my income this way. 

Has anyone set there rate increase as IC, with a notice, and how did it go?

Are they taking advantage of my willingness to accept their rate?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** u r correct.  as an IC, you set your rate, they decide if they want to hire you for that rate.  u do  not have to ask for the raise.  there is a chance they look elsewhere for IC help but I with the labor shortage and your familiarity with how they run their offices that option is not likely.  Their issue of the 1 clinic that is not too profitable is their problem, not yours.  I would give more like 30 days.  say 1/1/2023.  your request is reasonable.

> **Response 2:** I gave one of mine 10% increase 4 months ago when she asked

**Original Post:**
Taking the leap into entrepreneurship comes with all sorts of doubts, fears, and anxieties.

The first order of business (no pun intended) for all new practice owners is to grow a caseload that allows them to replace their salaries so as to not jeopardize their financial well being.

Totally understandable.

In order to grow a thriving business - one that ensures lasting success - the entrepreneur must begin to make the transition from "busy self-employed clinician" to a business leader; regardless of whether the plans are to add staff, locations, or not.

Becoming a leader, no matter the size of the company, takes some know-how.

One of the top skills any leader should learn is how to become skilled at Decision Making.

For all of us, the quality of our decisions will help to shape the quality of our lives, and our businesses.

The challenge happens to be that most of us are not great at making decisions, even down to the little day-to-day things.

I would love to get ideas from this group on how you incentivize therapists and/or front desk (administrative assistant) to sweeten the pot and encourage retention. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** from a general management perspective, understand what they value and give them more of that to show them your appreciation and that you understand what they value outside of work. 

Some people value money while others value time with their family. Some even value simply having a shoutout about them to the practice via a newsletter, or maybe even concert/ sporting event tickets. Not all incentives have to be monetary. 

This requires something that not many managers do and it’s to get to know your own staff much better and on a deeper level.

> **Response 2:** Find out why people are leaving. Treat them as you want to be treated. Respectful work environment, competitive pay, flexibility in schedule, etc.

Let’s get real for a second.

Some of you are waiting for a moment that’s never coming.

Waiting to feel “ready” to start your business.
Waiting to feel “qualified” to raise your rates.
Waiting to feel “confident” to speak up in a room full of people who inspire you.

But here’s the truth 👇

Confidence doesn’t *precede* the step — it’s *produced* by it.

In this week’s UNCAGED Podcast, we expose what’s really behind that hesitation we all feel — and how to push through it with one simple mindset shift:

🎯 You don’t need confidence to move.
You need movement to build confidence.

If you’ve been waiting for a sign to stop hesitating — this is it.

I feel like this is a really dumb question.....it is taking FOREVER for my new biz banking card to come in. It's holding up my being able to build a website, purchase an EMR, insurance, etc. I figured since it would be a recurring charge it's best to start it on my biz card. Is there a way to get this ball rolling without the physical card?

**Community Responses:**

Also what would be the must have items necessary for most visits?

Thanks in advance.

Am I crazy? Excited but kinda worried that when all work out, patients will be pouring. When I gave up the 9-5 snf, I enjoyed the freedom, family, vacays and life with a non rehab business as I “put things together.” with goals of online and private pay therapy. Basically semi-retired.

Then the scare of things not working out and funds depleted came. Had to go back to basics and take care of what’s needed. Made an HH contract only in my desired area. Not enough but I intentionally designed that for family reasons.

Now, this is what I’m facing
-Non rehab business
-3 HH contracts
-added a snf weekend prn (minimal hrs just to “help”
-partnered with a rehab billing group for Insurance patients 
-took a prn HH (for a consistent caseload)

I feel like things are gonna get really busy and of course suddenly my online presence and private pay clientele will grow as well. 

It is what it is. Gonna finish the year strong. Crazy I know.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yep, when it rains it pours for sure! 
But I get the dilemma. When you wind up having to work more hours. It's less time that you can put into your business. Every time I get momentum developing mine I get slammed with patients.

Just curious what is your non rehab business?

Running my practice for 25 years…
There are days that I wouldn’t mind a product driven business… ie food industry (everybody wants a hamburger) or B2B …versus our service driven business… where we are dependent on many variables…

Does anyone here do FCEs? Looking for a form (I've done them at a previous employer & prefer not to have to re-create!) and  a ballpark of cost.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use WebFCE. It’s all neatly laid out for you and generates a nice form letter and everything. I’m not sure of the cost of use for the software since I don’t own the clinic, but I know we charge $1200 for a 4 hour FCE and I think $200 for a basic 1 hour pre-work screen. Discounts for cash pay clients and some contracted rates with workers comp and lawyers offices. But our price starts at $1200. I’m in Florida if that makes a difference for you.

> **Response 2:** We use Occupro.  You can buy online packages single or in bulk. Depending on how many you use the price varies per use.  One time setup fee.  No reoccurring fees.

**Community Responses:**

Recently started cash pay practice - have a client interested but she’s on Medicaid. Can she pay out of pocket and submit a superbill for reimbursement? Am I allowed to see her? 

I know Medicare has some rules that I’m still trying to figure out and how to be a non-participating provider - the website information seems very convoluted to me (any help would be great!). If I’m a non-participating provider I need to charge everyone the same rate - but I don’t know what the Medicare rate is? 
I’m in Colorado for context.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I frankly would be a participating provider with Medicare. There are many advantages in terms of payment, submission to secondaries etc. I am happy to chat with you about it. I do Medicare credentialing as well as have my own practice.

> **Response 2:** I’m in Colorado. From my understanding in our state we can not treat a patient who has Medicaid and have him or her pay out of pocket for a Medicaid covered service of physical therapy

**Original Post:**
In your opinion what are the BENEFITS of cash or self pay PT? For the client not the therapist.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Transparency - you know exactly what your visit costs - no waiting to see what insurance covers, waiting to see if you've met your deductible, or paying a co-pay and then getting hit with a balance bill months later.  You can make an educated, informed, and empowered decision about your health by knowing exactly what your care will cost.

> **Response 2:** Better quality care! Usually in cash-based people have longer appointments and undivided 1-on-1 care. Typically your goals really get listened to and there is time to work through problems and come up with a good, detailed HEP to help make improvements. It's an upfront investment, but usually saves money and time in the long run not having to do PT 2x/wk for months where you're only being seen for 10 minutes.

SLP here, I am starting a mobile clinic, solo, and am confused about income. I currently do HH PRN and make $70 for tx visit. I have been told by others that in FL, Medicare pays $75 for tx visit, now is that for 4 units? 
These numbers are not helping me see how I can make more money with a mobile practice compared to my current HH gig. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** After looking at the fee calculator, keep in mind that those numbers are not what you’ll make. Medicare then makes some standard fee deductions. I think its about 23% less than the number you come up with.

Anyone use Jane app??? 

A patient of mine is a having a hard time with reimbursement. I have flat rate for treatments ($120) and evaluations ($150). Not divided up based on price per code per unit. 

The insurance company wants a total price breakdown for the procedure codes used. 

How do you guys go about this so it’s easy?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can make an "adjustment" called prompt pay discount for X amount. Then when they pay just apply the adjustment to go off of Megan

> **Response 2:** I just put $50 per unit and $150 for the eval and then apply a prompt pay discount to show my treatment cost

Hi All! 

Superbill question. 

I am OON with BCBS. Pt is requesting a superbill. Do I bill per code based on my normal fee schedule, or do I bill her my flat self pay rate? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Per code and if they pay day of service, I give a prompt payment discount since the cost is much higher than self-pay/cash. I’m curious what others have as prompt pay but I’m currently at 20% off.

> **Response 2:** per code

Good morning! Does anyone work with personal injury attorneys. Where they refer their clients to you? I would love to have a conversation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did but I used a 3rd party lien holder. The lien holder pain me directly a flat rate for services and when they took a reduction it didn’t affect me….. 100% make sure you have the lien holder and  patient sign a contract saying that if you get subpoenaed you get paid for doc review time, phone calls and court time… I stopped doing this because in Colorado the patient don’t HAVE to pay for you being subpoenaed and I spent days without pay because one lawyer and patient refused to pay

> **Response 2:** I would never want this.  A bunch of patients,(certainly not all)who are motivated by a settlement.  Waiting years for a case to settle and being asked to take a fee reduction.

**🚨 Are You Winning... or Just Spinning?**

Things finally starting to *click* in your business?
Be careful—this might be the *exact* moment you’re about to derail your growth.

In this week’s episode of the **Uncaged Clinician Podcast**, Kevin DeGroot shares the real story of how he nearly blew his momentum by chasing every opportunity that came his way.

➡️ He calls it his “spinning plates” moment.
And it’s one he doesn't want YOU to repeat.

Here’s what you’ll get from this episode:
🔹 The *false promise* of early diversification
🔹 Why a “boring” business is often a *profitable* one
🔹 How shiny object syndrome silently kills growth
🔹 The systems you NEED to step away without things falling apart
🔹 How to scale the *right way*, at the *right time*

💡 *Uncaged Hack:* “Diversification is more of a distraction than it is an advantage.” — Kevin DeGroot

If you’re finally gaining traction and wondering, *“What’s next?”*—this is the conversation you *can’t afford* to miss.

🎧 Listen now: [podcast links in the comments below]

And hey—if this hits home, do us a favor:
✅ Drop a comment with your biggest takeaway
🔁 Share it with a fellow clinician on the edge of burnout
💬 Let’s start a conversation about building *intentional*, scalable, freedom-first businesses.

I just finished a coaching call with one of our PATHWAY students.

I asked: "*What have your learned so far?"*

His answer: "***There's no way that there is just one thing. There has been so much in terms of what I'm selling, how I'm selling, where my focus is, how I'm having conversations with people***."

I'm so pumped right now that this has me doing push-ups!! 💪

Hi everybody, 

I’m looking for some advice on how to go about joining as a partner/part-owner in another therapist’s practice. I’ve been working with the owner most of the time the practice has been open, but I’ll be moving to an area that isn’t feasible to drive to the practice anymore. 

I like the idea of opening a second clinic as a co-owner to grow the current practice, while also having the safety net (earning a % of current clinic’s profits) while slowly building the new practice in an area I will have zero connections. 

What are some things to get in order before this could become a reality?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I highly advise you to open your own clinic. Partnerships rarely work out. That is a fact. If you’re gonna be putting in all the blood sweat and tears to growing a new practice, you might as well own it on your own! Lots of experience with this – partnerships rarely work.

> **Response 2:** Go in as a profit sharing model with the current owner. Like a strategic partnership.

Other than insurances, where should I change the practice address?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In Ohio you need to update your PT license info - change the address of where you are practicing on Ohio OTPTAT 

Check your LLC as well? I think you can update that address.

So, i have an interested client whom knows others interested in mobile cash  PT. Help me calculate my start up "Leg Work time". If I get my PLLC vs LLC ( have to contact my county today), how many days do y'all think I'll be ready to start treating? I still have to buy a laptop and Jane, and liability insurance. But those are quick to do. ; ) i have K tape, Edge iastm tool, foam roll, and occipivot, and foldable tx table. Am.starting slow, 1 day a wk txs. Still working my job. 4d/ wk

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That makes sense.  Thanks

> **Response 2:** You can start treating the moment you have your liability insurance after establising your business. In some cases you can function as a sole proprietor (I personally recommend a separate entity even if you will be a single member). You don’t need a fancy EMR. You can do hand written notes or a word document to just start off.

**IT ALL STARTS TODAY!!**

The time has come to no longer worry about what others are doing, or what they are saying.

They are not in the arena.

*YOU ARE.*

Starting your own practice or *even your side hustle* now is as good of time as any.

The only person you need to be concerned about in the race is you.

We are going to walk, jog, and run right beside you for 10 weeks.

Our goal is make sure that you are profitable at the end of the program.

What does that mean?

It means you have gained a client, or several, and you have earned back your money.

Plus, you will be on track for building your business the right way.

The naysayers and the critics won't matter.

You will be building a practice around your values. 

The starter's gun goes off at **12:00 EST today.**

Even if you can't make the starting time, you will have access to all of the trainings... for ever.

You literally can not lose in this race.

Not with the UNCAGED CLINICIAN team training you.

Brand new business here - Have an opportunity to rent space that is a little smaller than I was hoping for but for a much better price than I can find anywhere else within my area, but landlord wants a minimum of 3 yr lease. My fear is what happens if I outgrow the space before 3 yrs since I feel it is a bit small to start? Since it's a brand new business I don't know if the business will flop or take off so hard to know what to worry about when it comes to size of a space. Anyone been in this situation before? Advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Negotiate...if you really like the space, but it's on the small side, perhaps you can offer to pay  more/month for say a year commitment, and then options to renew clause at 6 month increments ( with small percentage increases) for example. Doesn't hurt to throw things out there if you haven't already!

> **Response 2:** Write in a back out clause. We have been in business a long time sign every 5 years.   Our back out is a 6 month notice. No penalty.

Does anyone in here do insurance PT and self pay “well checks”? 
We are trying to find a balance between INN insurance based visits and our people that come every 4-8 weeks for a check in. 
My husband just went in network after doing strictly cash based and we are trying to figure out a model to accommodate both types without problems. (Legally or having complaints/drop offs from clients.) He will have a PTA to help with insurance visits.
He does training as well so I know there’s a good line there, but for a few he only needs to see them every now and then (usually TMJ, neck or athletes with tweaks)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How about one patients graduate from physical therapy? They can sign up for a wellness plan. They can come every two weeks or once a month for self-pay appointment

My outpatient practice accepts only Medicare and is otherwise  cash based . I am considering to get in network with couple more insurances in California for getting more patients .

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why do you want "to work for this company" ?

> **Response 2:** Are you familiar with the existing rates across the different payers? I don't know about CA, but in my experience unless you are a hospital or similar facility you won't get paid enough to make it worth your time and effort. Especially true for a neuro specialty group.

I would first find out what the different payers are paying and see if you can afford to do what you do while accepting those rates.

Looking for guidance on accepting a patient with a work comp claim. I am cash based for all services, and typically provide a superbill to be submitted by the patient.

> **Response 1:** I wouldn’t think so. Call the work comp company. I’ve had to eat several evals in the past because I didn’t speak to them first. (I was ins based then.) I don’t know what you’re rate is, but they pay more per visit than what you charge. I’ve been paid $240 per visit from them in the past.

> **Response 2:** My workers comp pays me and then they reimburse him once I give superbill. The patient took care of everything.

Anyone work for Luna on the side while trying to start your own cash pay business? I work at an OP clinic but really want to leave and put more into starting my own practice but need some kind of flexible income while transitioning.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I work for Luna pretty much full time now. Hoping to provide cash services soon but I’m really enjoying Luna right now. Happy to answer any questions

> **Response 2:** I contract with them and love them. I also have my own mobile PT practice and I essentially use them for all of my insurance and Medicare patients because I don't want to deal with insurance. It's gone pretty smooth, feel free to reach out with any questions!

For those in a 1-on-1, cash-pay model, what's the best way to deliver a great clinical rotation for a PT student?
We have interest from students wanting to learn, however, I'm sorting through the differences of an insurance-based clinic where there's a plethora of patients to go around, versus a cash-pay clinic where the patients expect to see the PT every time and are paying a premium.
How have you guys navigated this?  Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a clinical rotation at a cash pay clinic when I was a student. I would co-treat the patient with my CI, and then the patient would get a bonus 30 min with me solo. Patients were all onboard with it because it was free extra time.

> **Response 2:** We had the students co-evaluate the patient with their C.I.,...and then the student would treat the staff PT's during free time.

Hi all! I was recently asked if I could stretch a former patient after he leaves inpatient rehab outside of my work affiliation. Does anyone know a standard going rate for that? And would you recommend getting individual insurance or creating a signed document for legal purposes?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes,creating a signed consent, and getting individual malpractice insurance. I use CM&F, it is better priced than HPSO.  As for the going rate, hopefully someone will chime in, as there are a few clinicians on here who do that.   Check the files above, I think there are some sample consents, but always best to run it by an attorney to be safe. Good luck!!!

> **Response 2:** for rate I would try to look up what personal trainers in the area normally charge and go on the 75% range since it won’t be true “skilled therapy” but you want it to be worth your time as well.

Hello!

I am doing physical therapy in California which means I have an scorp set up. Anybody doing contracts with home health companies full time? Or even just with one company?
My situation is that I potentially have a company to contract with at an hourly rate. I Would work a regular 40 hr home health schedule. Does anyone do this? Would I need to have any special compliance requirements on my end (something related to the modules that I do for with my current travel recruiting company, etc)?

Any feed back would be helpful!
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What you’re doing seems super common and straight forward in Ca

1) work with CPA to get S-Corp
2) get your own insurance
3) give the HH Agency your company tax ID number
4) open a bank account under your business 
5) they pay you. Your CPA handles the rest

6) I recommend taking 35% of every check and putting it in a separate savings account to get ready to pay Uncle Sam come next tax season

> **Response 2:** So I'm based out of nj- and I did work as a contractor part-time, but hours and days were set. I also interviewed with a home health company and asked if they would pay for an s Corp and both companies act turned it down bc in NJ we have abc laws that makes it in my opinion harder for an employer to pay the s Corp or even an LLC. I'm not sure if Cali has anything similar but I learned the hard way that many didn't want to pay me as a business entity but had no issues paying me as directly. I know this doesn't answer your question, but maybe if you Google abc laws you may or may not find some for Cali that may help you

**Community Responses:**

Pro football player getting his sports recovery in at my facility Campus Motion Physical Therapy & Cryo Sports Recovery. Lots of people in this group are missing out on solid recurring membership and package revenue by only focusing on "physical therapy" . The best advice I can give you is "Congrats on your DPT and certifications but no one cares" except for our PT colleagues. Start working on some wellness initiatives to complement PT and you might find an easier way to promote yourself and market your services 👀👀👀

**Original Post:**
Since this group is truely a plethora of knowledge, I am hoping to get some guidance as I approach a job interview. Long story short, I am wondering if full time cash based PTs are getting a salary similar to PTs working in insurance based clinics? 

I have 10 years experience as a PT and my OCS. I have worked for a cash based company (part time). I did not get to the conversation of what a full time salary would look like. In 2020 I began seeing my own patients when I was laid off, and I  pushed ahead working for myself. 

As much as I would love to continue my own cash based practice growth, I am in a situation where my financial health needs serious help. I am looking to move in with family across the country. I have an in-person interview lined up with what I am hoping is a dream job: cash based company with 8 locations advertising that they provide elite level services.

I was told to expect a salary that is on par with local insurance based clinics for this job. (I was given an exact # but am unsure if it’s appropriate to post) It’s in an expensive part of the country and I worry that I will still struggle to support myself. Considering that I haven’t worked full time in over 5 years, I am out fo practice with how to negotiate more for myself in a respectful way. ￼￼I was a tad shocked at the proposed salary because without taking insurances, and having to deal with declining reimbursement rates, I expected the pay to be a bit more. But perhaps I am just uninformed. I hope that it is acceptable for me to ask here if cash pay clinics hiring full time employees tend to provide very similar salaries as those that are insurance based?

I understand that overhead, benefits, etc all add up, and that this might be a very fair salary. Until I started my own small practice and was doing the math myself, I didn’t understand the cash flow of clinics. Now I find it empowering to understand. And most importantly, if there are appropriate questions or proposals that I could make to increase my salary potential, while being respectful to the business as a whole, I would love to learn from those who have been in a similar situation. Thanks for your help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I own my own brick and mortar cash clinic right now, and previously worked for a cash based clinic as an employee. 

When I was an employee I made 44% of my revenue. I worked for a company who had several offices across the company, maybe 6? They provided no real benefits, health insurance was expensive and no PTO. Mathematically this wound up being  75-80k a year salary before taxes. In my area, other OP Ortho job offers I was getting at the time were all in the 60-65k range. I like in Denver (high cost of living, poor reimbursement).

A year ago I opened my own cash practice. With overhead (including rent in an expensive part of town), my estimated take home, after taxes, will be between 80-90k this year. So a big step up to say the least.

> **Response 2:** A company with 8 offices prob. Has a lot of wasted expenses like middle mangers etc.  May want to look at a single locattion office

I own and operate a small private practice in North Dallas and wanted to share an exciting growth opportunity. I’ve been presented with the option to move into a larger space featuring five private treatment rooms—three of which overlook Bent Tree Golf Course. Zip code 75248

I’m open to connecting with fellow Uncaged clinicians (PT/OT/ST) who may be interested in renting one or two rooms as a way to grow their practice. Use of my gym equipment would be included.

If you—or someone you know—might be interested, please feel free to DM me. I’d love to start the conversation.

🔥 **You’ve got a vision for your business... but do you have one for your family?**

We see it all the time…

✅ Business is growing
✅ Team is thriving
❌ But home life? Unintentionally left behind

Here’s the truth — **how you lead at home directly impacts how you lead at work.**
If you were raised in chaos or perfection, it shows.
If you avoid conflict or struggle with commitment, it shows.
If you talk one way but act another… yep, *it shows.*

This week on the UNCAGED CLINICIAN blog, we’re digging into:

➡️ Why leadership starts in the family
➡️ How your upbringing shapes your leadership style
➡️ What to do when your personal life isn’t aligned with your professional one
➡️ And one small action you can take *today* to start shifting it

**You don’t need kids to benefit from this message. You just need to be serious about becoming the leader your practice — and your life — actually needs.**

I posted this earlier but got no response so I’m reposting for assistance. 

I started my mobile therapy practice in Florida and saw some patients but now I can’t continue due to work-related injury and an auto collision injury.  How do I dissolve my LLC, stop my subscription with my EMR, should I close my business bank account?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sorry you're going through that!
To answer your Qs....
1. Most states have a simple one page form to dissolve a LLC on their secretary of state website. I'd do that and file it before the end of the year to avoid taxes or annual fees for the following year.
2. Email your EMR company and tell them what you want to do
3. No need to close your business checking right away and personally I would probably wait until after you do your taxes

> **Response 2:** Do you plan to return to work?

Hey everyone! I’m almost ready to get started seeing clients through mobile therapy. Anyone have any insight into extra steps needed to perform treatment in public areas like parks? I’m in California if that’s helpful!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't think there are any extra steps I know in my public park. The only thing you need is if you're going to have more than 30 people. Otherwise me and just my client we just pick a spot, lay down our mat, have our equipment and there we go. But if you're worried about it you should probably check with the parks and rec department but I would say just do it. And yeah ask for forgiveness

> **Response 2:** Some jurisdictions require permits because you're conducting business in a public place. Contact your local chamber of commerce and they should be able to help.

For those of you who have started mobile practices on state lines in which you are licensed in both states. Do you need 2 separate LLCs or are you able to establish an LLC in one state but since you are licensed in both can see patients in both states?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do this. My LLC is registered in SC and when I opened a brick n mortar in NC I needed to get a certificate of authority in NC.  I believe different states have different requirements so I’d double check.  I was told if I was only doing mobile visits in NC that certificate of authority wasn’t required.   But a consult with an attorney in your states would for sure be able to tell you exactly what you would need to do.

> **Response 2:** If you do under one you need to register as a foreign entity.  You will need that address if you do Medicare and it’s a different Mac too.

Everyone has to listen to this episode by Capt David Bayliff f he interviewed Dr. Floyd and talked about "Why YOU need to start your own practice"

A lot of us here complain about our situation, government, insurance reimbursement, bad company culture. 

It really all goes down to WHY you should do this in your community. If you start a business talking about yourself, you will have a hard time. But if you start a business on why you want to do this. Why you want to serve. You will be fine...

Thanks Captain for the inspiration!

Does anyone here work within a wellness co-op? Seeking advice on legalities and how well it's worked or not for you. For specifics,   myself (pelvic PT), pediatric OT, lactation consultant, and birth photographer are wanting to get a space together. We'd all run out separate businesses within the same building.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I share an office with a lactation consultant, we are two separate business entities. We both signed a lease together, but when we were hunting some management companies preferred one person signed the lease and the other could be a legal subletter. Some of it might depend how you guys want to set it up, vs how management companies want you to do it. Obviously there are only 2 of us, which is a very different circumstance than 4 of you! We didn’t go further with anything written (she happens to be a family member) but I would consider some other legal draft between the four of you that wouldn’t be included in a lease signing. In terms of splitting utilities, cleaning, etc, heaven forbid one relationship goes south or they can’t make a payment etc. 
Beyond that, we love the set up! Great to have as an easy referral network 🙂

Hi everyone! I have an LLC and will be doing mobile only. I know you need malpractice insurance, but do you need general liability as well? I spoke with a CM&F rep and she said it helps to cover instances if someone were to trip over my equipment or if a patient got injured on my treatment table. Any input would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

Hi! I had someone reach out who was just in an automobile accident last week and was referred to pelvic floor therapy for her concerns. I’ve never treated anyone going through MV insurance - I’m OON/cash based to begin with. 

Happy to work with her but curious on other perspectives or anything to expect in terms of paper work or billing! 

Thank you in advance to everyone who responds!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Some states have different laws about payment for services using MV insurance etc, so check that first

Otherwise, you can still so your normal practice for cash pay and be paid at time of service.

If you decide to enter into a payment agreement with their attorney, then make sure you have a letter of protection on file. You likely won't be paid until the case settles and that can take a few months to a few years. In some cases they will pay out of a "fund", but it depends on the state and attorney. Also, most attorneys will come back and try to negotiate the final payout so you want to make sure your paperwork is solid so that you don't end up having to accept a fraction of what is owed. It is possible to build in "interest" to the cost because it won't be paid at time of service, but you also have to make sure you can sustain without being paid for an undisclosed amount of time. I've had some settle in a matter of months and others that have taken more than a year. Ultimately, if the bill isn't paid, it falls on the patient at the end of the day. So keep that in mind as well.

> **Response 2:** You can stay straight cash if u want.  You can bill PIP until it is exhausted then pivot to cash.  Or wait for settlement (not recommended)

Hi! Can someone please explain Medicare laws for seeing patients in their homes?
I’m a PT in Chicago looking to start doing more home visits. As of now, I’ve been providing cash-based wellness services rather than billing insurance. If I applied be a Medicare provider, could I still charge my full rate and the submit super bills? 
Any guidance or resources are much appreciated!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They would only reimburse you up to the allowable rate (you can look it up by code online) to my understanding

> **Response 2:** You couldn't for skilled care.  You would need to accept the Medicare fee schedule.  For wellness, u can continue to do what you do now.

Is there anyone doing a "cash discount" as in patients paying with literal Benjamin Franklins?

I was discussing with a chiropractor who does this. Their thought is that a cash patient is not triggering the credit card fee, and most of them are not asking for superbills thus saving time. Plus, patients love a discount.

I use Square (losing about $10 per patient) and I use Google Workspace, so I have to manually take time to make superbills.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Nope. Just say cash is preferred but multiple payment options are available, then they have no issue paying my full rate. I think many people understand how cash is extra helpful to a biz so they don't mind paying that way, but why short change yourself on decreasing the rate? I don't know the exact process but the interest on square can be used on your taxes too.

> **Response 2:** Please shop credit card processors. I always recommend going through underwriting with a bank because a) the fees are usually lower and b) they won’t randomly freeze your account if you sell multiple packages or land a big client (because they have already vetted you). Happened to 3 colleagues

Also cash discount screams tax evasion

Anyone in Ohio willing to share their insurance fee schedule? I'm cash based now, but I am looking into accepting insurances. I'm trying to see if it's even worth the time to be in network. I wish they'd tell you the rates before you sign the contract. I'm  mobile and primarily a pediatric practitioner so I don't need Medicare rates.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m cash, but I’ll tag some Ohio people! Rachel Botkin, Angela Onyekanne, Tiffany Dallas-Kish

> **Response 2:** The non-Medicare commercial payer plans are going to be around $20/unit. Medicaid plans are going to be around $15/unit. One plan that pays a single day rate is $55 per visit.

Can someone please explain how you accept cash for pediatric patients for mobile outpatient OT. What kind of patients need OT and don't have medical assistance (since you can't charge cash for medical assistance recipients, right?)?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not an OT or work with pediatrics, and I’m not sure what you mean by medical assistance. But I can speak from the parent perspective: my son is 7 and has ADHD and was referred to OT for emotional dysregulation and handwriting/fine motor issues. Doesn’t qualify for school services so we’re starting outpatient OT. Whereas my kindergartner qualified for speech therapy in school so we won’t be doing outpatient for that 🤷🏻‍♀️. Not sure but I assume things may vary by state as well.

> **Response 2:** Hello! I’m a peds PT, outpatient/mobile cash pay. There’s no regulation or mandate regarding not  allowing us to charge cash to Medicaid/CCS (here in CA) that I found so far.

Are there mobile practices that employ staff on a salary basis rather than pay per visit? I'm currently offering pay per visit but am considering switching to salary to provide more stability. How do you handle productivity, particularly when there are frequent cancellations? And how do you incentivize productivity beyond what's expected for the set salary? I'd really like to hear how others manage this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes we do.  We have moved to a salary plus commission model.  So they get their base salary for what we expect a normal caseload with cancellations will be and then they make commission for any sessions completed over and above that number.  When we do annual raises and holiday bonuses this is also factored in.  This incentivizes therapists who want to make more money to fill up their schedule.

> **Response 2:** 🙋‍♀️ We have a base visits per week that they are ‘salaried’ on and then anything over that, they get an additional bonus per visit over their base. If patients cancel and they are going to fall under their base visits/ week, they let me know and they help out with administrative stuff/marketing/ social media/ etc.

Should physical therapists be more involved in lobbying for changes to insurance reimbursement policies?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Coming from someone who is involved…. It is VERY difficult to   Advocate for changes in reimbursement if providers continue to sign lower rate contracts. The payers believe that rates are acceptable because they are accepted by so many.

> **Response 2:** Until someone takes the money out of politics, it would be unamerican to not buy as many politicians as we can! But yes, we could probably do a better job of lobbying for better reimbursement

**Original Post:**
Hello Everyone.  I have been seeing clients privately for 25 years. I have a good referral source in place and am ready to expand a bit. I have 3 therapists, who I know very well and are ready to take any referrals I can’t handle time-wise.  
My plan is to do the marketing, get the referrals, see the client for the initial evaluation/consultation, get payment for a Package of sessions, and then assign them to an appropriate therapist. 

My questions:

1.  What’s the best way to set up this relationship (I’m in California)?

2. I will have them sign the document declaring they are a separate business (I forgot the name of it). 

3. How should I pay them (Venmo, Zelle vs check etc)?

4. What % of the total fee that I collect should I pay them?
 
5. Do I 1099 my payments to them?

And there’s probably some considerations/ legal items I’m not thinking about as well. I’m open to suggestions!

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would definitely pay by check & hopefully they will understand they would be independent contractors since they will be 1099’d at the end of the year. (I think I read that Venmo was going to start reporting when someone received more than $600/year from one source to the government & that might create a nightmare for the IC). The % of the total fee would depend on how much “extra work” you’re needing to do ie billing, marketing, accounting etc. I pay my IC’s 80% of what I (my company) receives as payment. Make sure they carry their own liability insurance also. In some states, it was mandatory to have to carry workers comp insurance also.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d be happy to talk to you. My team was originally 1099 (we cover CT and RI)

Question for people who rent space from a bigger clinic/gym or people that rent the actual space…I have a sports psychologist who is interested in renting some space from me for her business. She will have a private treatment room that is solely hers (roughly 10x12) but she also needs an open corner in the open gym and possible use of rebounder. She would have access to bathrooms, kitchen, front lobby, etc. I currently have a total of 2,000 sq. ft. What is the going rate for subleasing the space? I know it would be dependent on how long she is wanting the space but I am kind of looking for a starting point. 🤔🤔

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

At UNCAGED CLINICIAN, we want to bring therapists 𝙩𝙤𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧; regardless of the discipline.

Where do we want to go far?

A healthcare SYSTEM where 𝙥𝙖𝙨𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣 is maintained, there is true 𝙘𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 among professionals, care is 𝙥𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙩-𝙛𝙤𝙘𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 driven, and 𝙗𝙪𝙧𝙣𝙤𝙪𝙩 is a rarity. 

A place where one can find both 𝙘𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙡 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙗𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥.

And that’s just the moon on the way to the stars. 

How are we getting there?

We’ve built the 𝙐𝙉𝘾𝘼𝙂𝙀𝘿 𝘼𝙋𝙋…

𝘼 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙮 𝙗𝙪𝙞𝙡𝙩 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙘𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙨, 𝙗𝙮 𝙘𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙨

We would love nothing more than to have as many as possible riding with us. 

We’ve got plenty of room on the bus. 

Come join the ride with a 𝙁𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧’𝙨 𝙢𝙚𝙢𝙗𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥.  

𝐓𝐀𝐊𝐄 𝐀𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐍𝐎𝐖!

The Founder’s membership offer ends 𝐀𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐥 𝟏𝐬𝐭. And that’s no joke.

For those in gym spaces, any advice for setting up a lease agreement with a gym? Such as, what are some things to be mindful of when drawing up the lease agreement, rent prices, etc. Insight or any clinical pearls would be appreciated. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** generally speaking, keep the gym out of your books...... meaning, flat rate price is fine, price per patient is fine, % of profits, not fine.

> **Response 2:** I do a flat 20% for 19 months now. Has worked out well. Months vary but it all evens out.

Please and thank you!

**Community Responses:**

I have a patient who is part of the VA healthcare system. They want to come see me for physical therapy services and are willing to pay me, as I am a cash based clinic. I am in the state of Colorado. Are there any rules for charging someone cash that’s apart of the VA? Any known restrictions?

**Community Responses:**

Hoping someone here has some advice!
Short story is a scammer opened a business checking account using my LLC and EIN. I found out because the bank sent a monthly statement and then a change of address letter.  I was able to shut it down (hopefully) before any damage was caused but I'm not sure it ends here. The fraud department at USBank said scammers will typically open multiple bank accounts at the same time with the stolen info. So my question is, how can I pull a "business credit" report to see if someone has opened lines of credit or other checking accounts in my business name?  Nothing is showing on my personal credit report but neither is the legit business LOC that I have with my bank so I'm not sure if would even appear there. 
TIA for any insight

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Did you notify the credit bureaus so they can freeze your account from new credit allowances? Trans Union, Equifax and ??? ( The third one is escaping me at the moment)

> **Response 2:** You can also pull one free credit report from each bureau once a year. That'll allow you to verify your accounts and see others if they are on there.

So another question for clinic owners or future clinic owners... when or what sparked the moment when you knew it was time to open your own clinic? How did you know it was time? Was it the location that you couldn't pass up? Was it one of those now or never type of decisions? 
Also I know views differ on this topic but what are your thoughts on partnership with a physician or hospital, or another friend PT, or just going solo on your own with the business. Sorry for all the questions. TIA

Hi everyone,
I wanted to get some insight from fellow business owners who do corporate wellness or speaking events.

We’re fortunate to have an ongoing partnership with a corporate company that flies us out to different events around the U.S. We’ve done this twice now, and I’m curious how others structure their pricing for similar situations.

Do you typically charge an hourly rate, a daily rate, or something else entirely? Do you include compensation for travel time in addition to reimbursement for expenses?

For context, this company covers all travel costs and reimburses expenses, but the events themselves don’t lead to direct business for us since they’re outside our service areas.

Would love to hear how others approach this — especially those balancing fair compensation with maintaining a good long-term partnership.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like a cool gig.  Would love that connection ha.

> **Response 2:** I’d say hourly rate for the speaking part. But I also like the daily part for all your other time..  so you could maybe roll that all up into one lump sum

We are now fresh into the 4th Quarter.  

There is still time to make good traction towards your goal of building your dream!

Our new ***UNCAGED UNIVERSITY*** has been designed to give you the clear pathway and direction needed to achieve exactly what you desire.

One of the things I love about this new program is that Kevin DeGroot and I have completely taken away the typical time-stamps that accompany so many coaching programs. 

What does that mean?

Whether it takes you 6 months or 2 years to go through the content, it doesn't matter!  *You get to move along at your pace*.

And you have access to the content forever!

Is there 1:1 coaching?  You bet!

And here is the best part: ***You get to choose how much individual coaching you want when you want!***

We have added a ton more video content to our previous program, complete with handouts and even quizzes to hold you accountable and ensure that you are learning from the resources.

*Markers have been identified to help you know how you are progressing in your journey of becoming an business owner*.

*There are defined outcome measures at the end of each term to help ensure that you have a well-oiled practice and the necessary systems in place.*

Since this is a new program for UNCAGED CLINICIAN, we are currently offering a $1000 discount off the regular price!

Any hybrid practices here who have a spreadsheet to help analyze the spread of income across insurances/cash pay? Looking to identify what my mean pricing is and how to find my optimal price point.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** From my experience, the cost discussion is not a deal breaker. Whether someone pays you $20 more or less or whatever the case may be won't matter much. People buy with emotion so if you tap into their emotion they will pay whatever and if you don't they won't pay anything. If people are in network with any insurance they can't freely share what they are being paid via the contract.

> **Response 2:** Following to hear what the number wizards say. 😅🧙

For those who does self pay and sells pre-paid plan of care/package, but also allows those payments to be broken up into installments. How do you keep track of that in term of accounting? Do you know if there is an app or program that allows you to create "account" for each client and add money in and track money out?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t allow installments on prepaid packages, because that wouldn’t be prepaid 🤪 but, I use quick books and can easily track any and all payments including partial payments.

> **Response 2:** I either offer smaller packages (smaller discount but something for committing) or single sessions. No installments. That'd just get confusing to me.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unless you’re in Bozeman, Missoula or maybe Kalispell/whitefish, I will say there likely isn’t a huge market for pure cash services—just based on my experience living in a few different places! People here can hardly afford to live the way it is, let alone pay 100$+ per therapy session.

When y’all are figuring out package pricing is there a rule of thumb you use or how do you determine how much to take off when someone does a 4 session, 6 session, 8, etc?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I decided what I wanted my “minimum” rate to be, and calculated the math up from there. For my six visit package, I offer 5% off if they commit to 6 but choose to pay as they go, or 10% if they pay for all in advance. If they choose a 10 visit package, they get a 10% discount to pay as they go, or 15% to pay up front. I have a policy for how long they have to redeem those visits, and what happens if they don’t use all the visits in the allotted time.

> **Response 2:** Lots of ways to go about this. Just make sure that your "best price" is not lower than the session rate you need to stay viable. (I.e., if everyone bought sessions at your best rate, you would still be able to pay your business bills and pay yourself a living wage.)

I don't do packages, per se. If they buy the full POC that I propose at eval, they get my POC discount. Anything other than that is a percentage upcharge, based on my personal "minimum" rate.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We are in north GA, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, my husband usually charges $120 per visit and $150 for new eval., he had some patients he charged $100 and one is paying $250 per visit now because they are too far and only wanted him so they are paying for time he spends driving.

Need some advice/words of wisdom

I moved from a full time SNF + side hustle to 3 day part time at the SNF and 2 day part time working for my cash only practice at the beginning of November. I structure it typically for 60-75 min treatments and 90 minute evals and have been ramping up to 3-4 visits a week. So right now I am still pretty dependent on the income for those visits to replace the days not at the SNF (6 visits/wk is break even with expenses) I  heavily use counterstrain as a manual technique and that is generally what brings in the clients. The colleague/mentor who introduced me to this technique and had a part time cash practice recently told me they were moving out of state and said she would recommend her clients to see me when they needed therapy. Then, she also connected with a retired PT in the area who reached out who owned several insurance base clinics in the past and extensively studied counterstrain and was certified in it. At our first meeting, he mentioned that he isn’t getting satisfaction doing PRN 1-2 days a week for SNFs and doesn’t want all his knowledge with counterstrain to go to waste with him retiring. He told me his goal was to help my business grow and be able to pass on his knowledge. He mentioned money wasn’t important since he was retired and if I wanted to utilize him, then pay him what I felt he is worth. Of course with his business knowledge and clinical knowledge, my first thought was there was no way I can afford what he is worth. I know I’ve had a lot of these doors just open in front of me and I want to take advantage of these opportunities but looking for some wisdom on how to utilize him to grow personally and grow the business to hopefully full time but also make a wise financial decision too. I’m meeting with him a second time soon but I’ve been racking my brain on how to utilize him not just as a 2nd therapist to generate income but more as a mentor and how that would play out as well as how to pay him.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would have an honest conversation about what he wants you to pay him. Give him your honest situation and then ask him to tell you what he would do in his situation. Use that to make a decision on pay. I would highly recommend you co treat with him so you get better at counterstrain (it's mainly what I do). Mentorship with FCS is essential

> **Response 2:** Agree with David Harvitz you need to get a firm number in place before he starts providing services on your behalf. Sounds like a chill dude and doesn’t want to put stress on you, but trust me it will be more stressful trying to figure out what he is worth later as he either provides a lot of financial value, or doesn’t.

Or should I set up the PLLC before reaching out?

I'm just starting a part time cash only gig working out of my CrossFit gym with ability to do mobile as well, so I am looking for some guidance how to create a PLLC in Florida. I wanted to save myself some money by just creating the PLLC myself and not go through an online site, but all I am finding is how to file an LLC (seems pretty straightforward on Sunbiz) but not what extra steps are entailed with a PLLC.  I just keep finding the definition between the two. Has anyone gone through the process themselves?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can save yourself time and use a service.  You can write off start up costs.

**Original Post:**
Seeking advice/suggestions. I opened an LLC a few years ago, but have not been actively seeing clients due to working full time elsewhere. I still upkeep the business license, web domain, etc. 

My spouse got a new job and we are relocating to another state. I would like to start seeing my own clients again, instead of working for another company. The new state requires a PLLC. Are you allowed to open a PLLC with the same name? Should I start another business with a different name? I plan on keeping my therapy license in both states, so could see clients virtually with my old LLC. 

Has anyone ever encountered this situation, or have advice? Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The name will be irrelevant for a new state because it's a different state, unless someone else has already taken that name, then you're fine. However, I would keep all your clients under one LLC not two. You can still see clients in the old state with your new state llc. All that matters is you are professionally licensed in the states that you are seeing them.

> **Response 2:** The name likely won’t be an issue if it’s not already registered/taken. Your answer depends on how much you think you’ll net in the PLLC. If above 40K, and the first LLC was set up as a Solo prop,  you should set the second one up as an S corp. if the first was an LLC/ S corp, I’d put the PLLC under the S corp.

Practicing in California…Going to be starting a corporation (can’t do LLC In CA) as I start seeing some patients on the side through a OON lense. 

My question is — I also work 1099 for a DME consulting company and get paid via direct deposit. Once the corporation is set up can I have the DME company pay my corporation directly? If so, would that even be beneficial for me from a tax or other incentive perspective?

**Community Responses:**

Hi all!!

Question for Illinois self employed therapists. From what I have read, I need to start a PLLC but when I went to the website to create, the only option is an LLC. Do I need to start with an LLC and then covert to a PLLC somehow? Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t think you can apply online for PLLC. I had to go mail in my application since there’s no option for LLC online. Then once your articles of organization get accepted through Secretary of State (2-3 weeks later) you have to apply through IDFPR separately. That portion I did all online. Then it took another 6 weeks for my to get my business license after I submitted to IDFPR. It’s super annoying

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There is a lot of little things...do you have employees yet? When you do don't miss getting work comp insurance (Some new business owners overlook that when they start to hire). If missed the penalties are high.

Monday motivation post! 

Like probably some of you guys, doubted ourselves in the beginning, had many fears and didn’t think we can get our own first patient…but here we are, we showed up and made a difference to the Parkinson’s community! At the end of this month, we got invited to provide a seminar to our local PD group. 
If you are still thinking of being an UC, a little reminder to trust the process, keep the faith and believe that you can also be your own boss! 😉

I originally started my practice as mobile. However, recently I have had the opportunity to rent out space from a chiropractor a couple days a week. As a result I will be doing a hybrid model of in home/office. For those that do this do you now have to add your office address on your LLC and business registration? My current address is under a PO Box number due to originally being mobile. I’m wondering also how this affects superbill coding of (12) or (11). Thank In advance for guidance.

During our last staff meeting, we had a discussion about CX policy because of some of the recent drama about it, with patients not wanting to pay for CX. 
Since we only see neuro patients, the populations we work with can have a lot of things going on and we try to be compassionate and understanding. How are you handling your CX policy when medical things like that happen? 
Do you have a list of things that you don’t charge for or do you always charge? Right now we just send a reminder for first time and do not charge them, the second time we do.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We personally do it case by case. If someone it abusing the situation Ed charge.

Hey everyone! I am polling you for fair pricing in this scenario. Former Pelvic floor PT at a big Urology practice.  I am partnering with 2 other PFPTs in a cash based startup clinic. Good support and rapport with Urology practice. They are closing their program due to poor insurance reimbursement but wish to keep acenter of excellence by offering classwork for individuals undergoing prostatectomy. One hour session twice per month. Same lecture each time as it will be new attendees each session. How much would you charge the Urology practice per hour? You also get to market your business and classes in the session.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Id ask for the rate you’d get per hour seeing one of your cash clients. No sense in taking a pay cut if you can help it. 

If they say no, then you can negotiate a lower rate.

I am applying for a position at a cash based clinic. I come from an OP hospital setting, so very different. 
I go for a second interview next week and I feel lost as to what I should be asking about when it comes to a cash based clinic. I don’t want to be blind sided. Tell me what I should know, what I should inquire about, red / green flags, etc. thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In my opinion, the biggest downside with being an employee of a cash-based clinic is that oftentimes, you’re expected to significantly contribute to building your caseload. Like basically hustling to market yourself to bring in patients. So I would ask the typical time to a full caseload for employees and what that looks like for you during the interim (in terms of guaranteed hours, admin pay vs. patient pay, etc.). Good luck!

> **Response 2:** Which state are you working? I’m hiring.

1. Best way to document and do super bills for a one PT company? 
2. Better to do Medicare and cash pay vs just only cash pay? 
3. Going rates in Texas for eval, follow up, manual therapy alone in home? 
4. Do you change your rates if meeting at a gym? 

Thank you anyone for insight!

If you are providing a balance class at an independent living facility for 45-60 minutes, how much do you charge? I was asked to provide twice a week ongoing and am having trouble figuring out what is appropriate to charge. I believe the facility would pay. Thanks so much.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How much will you reduce falls in their facility over the course of the year, and how much do the residents and their families value that service and the confidence you can bring?

Personally if it were me, I’d be looking at around 200 an hour, then stay later and chit chat with everyone for more than the hour. Have fun!

Any boxing bag recs?  And pros and cons hanging from ceiling versus floor? Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do a wall mounted bracket (bag sold separately) in a corner if you want to save space. They make brackets that can swing and pull in/out from the wall. I bought one on Amazon for a reasonable price. Make sure you mount it to studs with 1x4 bracing between the sheet rock and metal punching bag bracket (spreads force out along the studs). The cost for the bracket and bag should be around $120-$150 total.

Hello.  I have been approached by a SNF to provide prn services.  Even telehealth if possible.  It’s been several years since I have provided contract services to a SNF.  Anyone have input on reimbursement?  Hourly? Or per visit/ per unit? / how much?  And any input on telehealth?  Also years ago, when I did this type of contract work I charged a small fee per visit that in-house PTA provided.  I feel this is justified as I am assuming  responsibility for provision of services to the patient.  Has anyone else done this and thoughts and input appreciated. Thanks all.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PRN work is quite common in the SNF world, though I am very curious as to the telehealth component as that’s something I do regularly. Typically I see an hourly rate for services.

> **Response 2:** I don’t know the set up of your business but I would only do this if I could do my own billing.

Question on health plans when starting your own practice. Any good resources or stories on plans that worked for families? This is a concern going on my own as I currently receive as part of my benefit package.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There really isn’t. This is why I could never go out on my own. Expect at least $2,000/month coverage for a family. You can find less, but your deductible will be outrageous or nothing will be covered. Contact a health insurance broker.

> **Response 2:** One option is to check your state’s health insurance marketplace (the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare). See if there are insurance brokers associated with it who can help you look at plans on the marketplace (the brokers are no cost to you) and ask them if you might qualify for tax credits which lessen your monthly cost. I did this after a layoff and was pleasantly surprised about the affordability - though I’m not getting family coverage so can’t speak to that part.

Hi all!  I'm just getting started, and wondering about how to set my pricing.  

I am planning to offer a hybrid-type model (for now, I have a nice treatment area set up at my house - maybe it could be a little strange for some patients, but I figure some people may not want me coming to their home!?).  

When you offer pricing, do you charge extra for traveling to your patient vs treating at your brick and mortar location?  I'm not sure exactly how to go about this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I treat from my own home studio. At first I thought it might be a turn off,  but I have everything one would need. If cash paying and patients wanting me to come to them, I’d charge more and wouldn’t travel more than 20 minutes. So far, (in the 1.5 years I’ve been doing this) everyone is local and comes to me.

> **Response 2:** I charge a flat rate for my visits. I actually make more on a mobile visit because there's no overhead. If I see someone at the sublet I have to pay the gym. Also depends on the state I think in some it's illegal or frowned upon to do a travel charge. Jarod Carter had a few examples of ways to manage that on his podcast.

Are you allowed to charge patients a billing fee?  
Background: Patients at the clinic pay upfront for OON treatment and are given a superbill. Several patients mentioned that they would be willing to pay a small fee if they didn’t have to submit the super bill themselves. I’ve told patients about Reimbursify but can you charge a patient to bill for them in-house?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think what you can do is bill them a full amount, and then discount those that submit themselves.

> **Response 2:** This is a very interesting question

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do this often.  I think of it as an unbillable service since no insurance company would pay for 2 concurrent therapies at home.  I have then sign the standard paperwork and make sure they understand that it is not reimbursable. These patients are usually easy bc they know from the start they are paying out of pocket for a premium service.

FSA cards.. I have a new patient I evaluated who wants to buy a large package to utilize her remaining balance on her fsa for this year. I gave her an estimate on how many visits I think she would need and estimate her poc to be about 3 months. First question is it ok to use the FSA to buy a package even if she uses half of it in 2023? Second, she asked if she doesn’t use all the visits if she can be refunded? not sure how that works for an fsa account.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Technically can’t be refunded if it’s an FSA… to my knowledge.

> **Response 2:** I would also recommend that you put an expiration date in your packages.

Hi everyone!
I wanted to share my niece’s contact info. She’s amazing with analysis and spreadsheets/all things excel.

In my business, I track many monthly stats: number of visits, number of new evals, gross/net income, percentage of visits that are mine, and a few other things. I was struggling to create graphs for me to analyze and see my data clearly. She was amazing…. She understood my goals and vision and created clear graphs and tables for me. She also created a video for me so I know how to independently update my data each month.

I attached a few of the graphs (without my actual numbers cuz I’m not comfortable sharing all of that). There’s WAY more she did for me but I just posted a few.

I wanted to give her contact info if anyone is interested in having her help you at a great rate! 😀

Her contact info: Juliet Day

Hey everyone!! I have a work comp company who called me to send me a patient.

I’m wondering if I can negotiate the price with them and how I should go about doing that?

Currently my self pay rates are higher than what they are offering. And I also make more from seeing Medicare patients/some commercial insurance.

So is it really worth my time to accept what they offer to open the door for more work comp in the future? Or do I negotiate? If so, how?

I have a patient that wants to pay cash for PT, but has Access Insurance. I have heard that Access is super strict with the services that they cover and that a patient can pay cash for something that is they cover. If Access finds out that if a patient pays cash instead of their insurance both parties could get in trouble. Is this true? Has anyone worked with an Access patient and doing cash PT?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I was reading the guidelines it seemed like AHCCCS follows Medicare guidelines so I approach it the same way and only do wellness services and refer out for PT services

> **Response 2:** I’d be curious as to what the contract with the beneficiary says.  
I would find it interesting if the contract says: “You are absolutely forbidden to pay for any service yourself.”

Maybe it does? I have no idea 🤷🏻‍♂️

Goals are checkboxes. 

Growth is transformation. 🚀 

Instead of asking *what do I need to do?* ask *who do I need to become?* 

Systems help achieve goals, but lasting success comes from personal and professional growth.

**Original Post:**
Would a therapist be allowed to work for one agency full time but do part time per diem work for me as well? She would be doing the same type of work (CPSE services) and in the same county. Her agency doesn’t have many cases in this county because they’re based about an hour away. But because they’re huge, they have multiple contracts in multiple counties. Would this be a conflict of interest? I don’t want to step on any toes. Any advice would be appreciated.

You've probably seen other posts about the UNCAGED Business Launchpad

You may be questioning: "Should I do this?" "Is it worth it?"

How about this...

Don't take our word for it.

Here's what participants in the 1st Business Launchpad had to say:

"... helped me to grow personally: reignited my passion for learning to facilitate my clinical and interpersonal skills. Professionally: it enabled me to shift my mind set on how to structure a business, nurture relationships (personal and business), and acquire new patients."  - George S

"...helped me to focus on what was necessary and important, and not be distracted by all of the shiny objects I thought I needed to do.  And I'm more calm and peaceful now because of it" - Lynzie

"The UNCAGED Launchpad experience has been wonderful.  This program helped me establish a solid foundation to build on for many years! The value of the information provided is far greater than the monetary investment." - Wes T

"I have grown very quickly in knowledge, confidence, motivation, and have been completing tasks small steps at a time, but consistently to grow my business.  I'm so excited!" - Christina R

Take their word for it.

UNCAGED Business Launchpad II starts Thursday, July 27th.

**California cash pay question:**

I plan on seeing 1-2 patients a week cash pay, and do not plan on expanding beyond this. Can I do this without forming an LLC or any other corporation?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes no llc allowed. Sole prop. Only s corp as tax designation and for greater protection

> **Response 2:** Yes. You can do it as a sole proprietor. I don’t think that PTs are allowed to form LLCs in California. Consult a lawyer.

A while back I went through the process of getting my LLC to begin my own mobile OT business.  Life got in the way then and I ended up moving 4 hours away (back to my home town).  After the move, I never regained the momentum to keep pressing on with the business idea.  

Now I find myself facing a (mostly ethical) dilemma.  I live close to my parents and both of them are declining in health in different ways.  But they are also both in need of hospital beds.  Can I, ethically and legally, use my license and (so far unused) business to become their OT in order to write the required letters of medical necessity to help them get the equipment they need?

I have permission to give medical background if needed.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve worked on my parents before PT mobile. I documented their issues like I would with anyone and documented their treatments. There shouldn’t be any problem with that

> **Response 2:** Write the letter and talk with their physician for signature. 
Disclose your relationship to the physician.

So I am supposed to start my new job at a brand new facility soon. Was supposed to be July 8 th but town is giving us a hard time about zoning issue all of a sudden. I was called to meet with manager today about something. That something was they were approached to take over another practice that the chiropractor owner was leaving. He saw the coming soon sign on building and called to ask if wanted to take over lease and a PT was willing to stay. So now I am supposed to do hours their and market for new place. I have reservations about them taking over lease. They basically want to make it their second practice. They want to use same EMR  etc. haven’t seen place yet 
Just not sure if good idea

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** what is the benefit to your business? I can understand the Chiropractor looking for relief from his lease but you already have a plan in place. Unless you feel the zoning issues will be unresolvable, starting two practices at the same time is a lot. What reputation does the other office have? Plus do you want to inherit the PT? Remember your business plan to avoid going off on tangents that will not keep you on the track you laid out for business.

> **Response 2:** I’m completely confused to be honest. Are you an employee or are you going into business with these people you took a job with? as an employee, I wouldn’t think you would care what they’re doing to grow their business other than to make sure that what you were promised is delivered – in other words you wanted to work at one facility at a certain location and if they’re trying to change that then that’s a different story. Perhaps you can clarify.

California PTs. What are the fees you have to pay with the business entity as a P corp? I’m trying to see what is worth it for me in terms of doing my own thing in California.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You’ll need to pay for P.C. It’s all on the website. Then you can decide if you want to be an S-Corp or not. It’s all pretty affordable to start. Investing in yourself is when it can get a little more expensive.

> **Response 2:** I believe it's still $125 to file the Articles of Incorporation on the secretary of state website. Since we can't have a LLC in CA (see Moscone-Knox Act of 1976), it saves you the $800 LLC fee to incorporate plus the $800 annual LLC tax.

**Community Responses:**

I believe there's a window of how many days back that you can bill (that I'm not sure). But I waited until I was enrolled before I started seeing patients.

All the best!

**Original Post:**
I’ve never understood the appeal of the phrase **“move fast and break things.”** 
It started in the early tech world — a rallying cry for startups to grow at all costs, push updates without fully thinking them through, and worry about the consequences later.

Today, it shows up everywhere: in social media posts from “talking heads,” business influencers, and techies who love to preach speed over substance. 

Because when someone proudly uses this phrase, what they’re really admitting is:
* **They don’t fully know what they’re doing.** Breaking things is not innovation; it’s inexperience masquerading as boldness.
* **The adults in the room to clean up the mess.** Someone else always pays the price for their shortcuts.
* **It’s fundamentally selfish.** It prioritizes ego, speed, and bravado over responsibility and long-term consequences.

And here’s the reality: **our profession is not tech.**
Healthcare isn’t an app you patch later.
Patients aren’t beta testers.
Care plans and business models should not be “launched broken” with the hope of fixing them down the road.

In physical therapy — and in healthcare as a whole — we don’t get the luxury of breaking things to see what happens. Our work requires **precision, intention, and accountability**, not recklessness dressed up as innovation.

That’s why we apply **great caution** with companies, vendors, and even therapists who lean on this mindset. It’s a red flag. Healthcare demands a higher standard — one grounded in expertise, safety, and responsibility.

Real progress doesn’t come from breaking things.
It comes from **building carefully, thoughtfully, and with respect for the people who trust us with their health.**

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Bryan Williams I'd be curious to what aspect of business you are talking about when you say this? I don't disagree when it comes to treatment and quality of care but for figuring out your niche / unique offering as a clinic, I'm not sure I necessarily agree. I feel if you ask most successful clinic owners if they knew what they were doing their first couple of years of business they'd say they had no clue. 

As far as patients being "beta testers" though I agree 100% or at the very least if they are they need to know this upfront (and most likely receive a discount since they are willing to take the risk).

Hey question for PT‘s in Texas! I’ve recently had a pediatric patient that is very committed ask for a discounted rate due to financial situation. I want to make sure I’ve covered my butt, but I’m happy to do it for this family. 

Has anyone had this circumstance? Is it better to do a sliding scale or do a Package deal, which I’ve never wanted to do otherwise and dont plan to do otherwise? 

Also, I’ve seen advice for submitting super bills to still keep my original rate per session on there  even though I’m giving a discounted rate for this circumstance. ￼But is this allowed? Any advice would be welcome. Thank you so much! ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Charge however you want. Typically if its a financial hardship, they cannot front the cost if a package. Options would be payment plan to pay down balance or just a cheaper rate.  Cannot fudge the superbill, that would be fraud.

Please forgive me is this is naive. 
You're transitioning from your regular therapy business and pick up a few cash pay clients. 
One of them hands you cash. 
Another hands you a check with your name on it. 
Another wants to Venmo you but you only have a personal account. 

What do you do with that cash? Where do you deposit that check? Are all of these taxable income for your business?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you didn't have a separate business bank account, get one now. Separate credit card too to track expenses so you can write them off. 

Technically yes those are all income and I should track it in quick books or at least a spread sheet. If you want to accept Venmo you should also have a business account and they will charge a fee, but it's less than credit card fees.

Are there cash-based PT practices/clinics in Charlotte area?  Are any of you own a non-mobile practice or planning to open one, and possibly looking for partnering with another PT? Or maybe an existing OT cash-based clinic?

> **Response 1:** by law, the insured is obligated to pay the contractual rate on their their ins. contract to the provider.  it sounds as if the MD office is the provider and they are paying you a cleverly described salary and bonus.  does not sound uncaged to me but I think further info/attorney consult are needed.

> **Response 2:** Just be cautious of anything that may be perceived as fee splitting   I'd have a lawyer check anything

Has anyone employed someone at salary and then anything over the minimum pay them per patient ? do you see any drawbacks to this method?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have previously worked as an employee with this compensation structure in an OP Ortho cash-based setting. I liked it because I always had a guaranteed floor, and it made it was less stressful for me vs pure commission. Make the cap obtainable though so they are motivated to get to it, yet not discouraged that they won't be able to. If the cap where they make more is too high or too aggressive it may shoot you in the foot.

> **Response 2:** This is how most part A HH agencies do things, or they have no salary and everyone is pay per visit.

I have a quick question for the group!

I had my first client that was outside of my typical driving range. They accepted my travel fee but now I am unsure of what to do with that fee. Do I keep it as cash or do I have to count it as income?

I figured I would have to count it as income, but wanted to have other practitioners feedback.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It is technically income, but you can deduct the cost of travel (IRS recently increased it to $0.625).  This might actually end up being a larger deduction than was earned.

> **Response 2:** it is technically income

Has anyone in this group been an expert witness for a legal case? I was approached to do this and not sure what to charge. I have edited my post to add they do not need me to testify but would like a report prepared. Should I charge an hourly rate for this? Bill a retainer amount? Should it be higher than what my hourly rate for clients is? I have my own cash based business providing aging in place, wellness, and care management services. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Make sure there is a clause if they cancel at the last minute you still get some money due to blocking off your schedule.

> **Response 2:** Charge whatever your hourly rate is for the day (8-10 hours). You also can charge for prep time.

🚨 Business owners: Are you spending more time comparing yourself to competitors than focusing on your own strengths?

Here’s the truth:
👉 Comparison leads to imitation.
👉 Contrast leads to innovation.

In our newest blog, **“Why Your Business Should Focus on Standing Out, Not Fitting In,”** we break down the danger of constant comparison and show you how to shift into a mindset of confidence, clarity, and bold differentiation.

Because customers don’t want “more of the same.” They want what only YOU can offer.

Question: I am a mobile solo practitioner finally applying for an EIN, so I don't have to use my SSN on super bills. The application asks for "entity start date" as as sole proprietor, and I'm not sure if I should use the date I started as an "independent contractor" (i.e. working for home health agencies on the side in 2010) or when I consider myself starting as a "sole proprietor" (i.e. seeing my own clients as a mobile solo practitioner in 2018). My understanding is that "sole proprietor" is a more global term that encompasses "independent contracting." In the eyes of the IRS which date is most appropriate for this situation? TIA.

I’ve recently been seeing friend suggestions for patients of mine on my personal (and fairly well disguised) Facebook page.  Obviously I’m not adding them as friends, but I don’t like this! And are they being suggested to see me? I hope not! How can I stop it?

I suspect this is because I manage my business fb page and maybe also because my biz email address is linked in to the biz account and Facebook is seeing who I’ve emailed?

Don’t want to be a conspiracy theorist or break hippa or have my privacy compromised.

Advice?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It's based on location I think. Turn location service off. Their phone picks up yours and links the 2 of you are possible friends. Creepy the lines they cross really.

> **Response 2:** Also if you have their phone number or have reached out to them via personal cell phone that is logged into FB. I personally block them as soon as I see it as a suggested. My block list is a very very long list haha

Hello all! I got an offer from a start up rehab clinic to be a 1099 OT independent contractor. I’ve started my LLC but kind of clueless what steps to do next. The manager told me that filing under S-corp would save me thousands in taxes. Has anyone done this? Which payroll company do you use? 

Also, I purchased liability insurance from myotinsurance.com - has anyone actually used them? Pros? Cons? 

Anything else I could be aware of/ start researching? 

Thanks rehab community!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are more rules with S Corp. you need to assign officers and you (as owner) don’t just take owners draw. You need to take some payroll on a Corp. I don’t know all the rules, but definitely look into it before making decision.

> **Response 2:** Hey there, I would need a little bit more context to help you out fully. Like which state your in? How you’d be getting compensated? Are you billing out under your LLC or are they paying you? Did you get a TIN/EIN yet? Did you register for a type 2 NPI? Did you credential with insurance companies yet? 

I’d be happy to help but need some further clarity. Feel free to DM me, just let me know it’s in regards to this post since it’s anonymous.

If you don’t have that you’ll have to call  the IRS to request a 147C which is an EIN verification letter.

Hi! I opened my LLC in NH and am in process of moving to ME. I will still be treating patients occasionally in NH via the mobile portion of my practice. I am trying to determine what I need to do with my LLC... change it over to ME, keep it in NH, or carry an LLC in both states. Any advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are your own registered agent, your LLC has to move to where your permanent address is and then you’ll file with NH to be a foreign entity.

Hi all,
I am thinking about potential relocation to Orlando, FL and had a few questions:

1) Do I need to be licensed in the state of FL to apply/open up a business there? Or can I use my current state’s licensure as proof that I am a Physical Therapist to be able to open a business there? I want to be able to start my business as soon as I get there
2) If I can’t start my business immediately with a FL registered EIN, can I treat patients under my current business while waiting for my FL business to be finalized?
3) What type of business structure is required for PT/OT clinics in FL? (PLLC, LLC?)

I have been searching away online however I couldn’t find clear answers to these questions. 

Any leads for people that help you set up your business in FL or can answer questions would be highly appreciated.

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe you will need to take a laws and rules exam to get your license in FL.

> **Response 2:** Fl you can do LLC. You'll need to be fully licensed IN Florida to treat patients there.

Business owners beware of being contacted by people calling from "merchant services" who say that you have been overcharged credit card processing fees and they will refund you. While they only call themselves "merchant services", they don't know anything about you or your company. They ask you to either open an account on www.businesstrack.com or send them your recent card processing statement. Luckily, I reached out to my card processing company who confirmed this is a scam.

> **Response 1:** We looked at them but did not do one. You do need LLC and business plans. As far as amount, that will vary based on your personal rent and startup costs.

> **Response 2:** I would not recommend this, save up enough to go on the offense for your start up.  SBA for an existing business that is producing money makes more sense.

For those of you doing hospice contract work, what do you typically charge/receive for evals and visits?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have a contract with Accent care in Rhode Island. They pay us 150 for an evaluation and 125 for a follow up visits. With them in particular, we did not have much of a negotiation… They said these are our rates. 🤷🏼‍♀️

It would be for cash only patients to start.

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
Hi! I wanted to hear what others have done in this situation or suggestions on how to go about it.

I’m increasing my follow up rates but just for all my new patients moving forward. I’m cash based but provide superbills with an itemized breakdown of each code to most of my patients. 

I currently use Jane so I have my follow ups set to a certain rate - and then add codes to equal the “total.”

If I’m only increasing rates for new people, do I set all follow ups to the new rate including the billing codes, and add a $5 deduction to my old clients?

Or do I have two different sets of billing code prices and use the “correct ones” for each patient to add up to my different rates?

I just wanted to make it simple changing it slowly and not impacting my current clients but just wanted to hear how people have done this on Jane or with billing codes. I only expect it to be an 8 to 10 week transition due to my current plan of care times. 

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Things to keep in mind:
- all patients must be billed equally, you only have 1 charge sheet. This does not change depending on how someone can pay (insurance vs non-insurance)
- in general, all charges and possible discounts must be available to all patients equally, providing they meet the guidelines (my assumption here is that "former patient" status would be considered an arbitrary guideline based on legal aspects, but IANAL)
- discounts after the fact can be applied depending on circumstances, as long as legal guidelines are followed (such as a documented financial hardship form)
- if someone pre-paid for services before the price change went into effect, those would be grandfathered in (to the best of my knowledge, again, IANAL, just very interested in safeguarding my own practice). 

There are patient safeguards and license requirements that disallow the charge for a service to be different for patients based on arbitrary guidelines (like old vs new patients). Grandfathering may be nice, but you'd want to consult actual legal advice based on your local laws in conjunction with national laws to make sure you're not putting yourself in a legally compromised position.

In reality, when I raised my cash pay rates $25 for an hour of service I gave my current patients 2 months notice and let them know that in trying to balance a reasonable cost vs service vs keeping the doors open, that's where the numbers ended up. I had zero cancellations from those conversations because I let them know in advance and discussed the legal restrictions I have in regards to having a single charge master.

Good Morning
I have a patient who is a family friend, I know they can’t afford their higher co-pay per visit…. I was wondering if I can give them a discount on their Co-pay? Or if I can completely forgive the entire co-pay? Business perspective I understand it may not be a good practice but looking for legal aspects… please guide…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No, you cannot. You have to collect their copay.  If their co-pay is too high then they should select an insurance that has a lower copay.  Maybe you can see them for wellness if it's not medically necessary

> **Response 2:** Technically if u r in network with their insurance. U r contracturally obligated to collect all co-pays, co-ins, deductibles etc.  In reality, u could just right it off.  But I would ask them not to mention to anyone that this was done.

I set up an Ivy Pay payment system and a bank account through Bluevine as I get started. I’ve seen good reviews on here for both. But I have payments sitting in my Ivy Pay account and they have not transferred after days now. Reading some more internet reviews, others have had these issues but with significant more money 🤦🏻‍♀️ I have contacted both accounts, waiting to hear back. Anyone else have this issue or am I missing something? I may just scratch both methods and go with other companies.

Hi y'all. Wanted to get a sense of what I should be asking for a workshop I may potentially do. 
It's not meant to make bank or promote an offer. just trying to help people out with some information.
If I would do it on my own, it would be really informal and I would have done it at a low cost for the participants and hope to get at least 30 people attending for 10 dollars each.
I am in talks with an organization (in Montreal, Canada) that is interested to join me for it. If I contract it to the non profit, I can choose my rate and hope they have the budget for it. They will not be charging the participants. So i don't want to highball it but don't want to lowball it.
It will take some prep on my part and be about 90 minutes. 
Do I charge my hourly rate (That people pay to see me)? because that may be too high for them to afford. but I also don't know how much they can afford. I don't want to name them but for context, this non profit provides medical, legal and social services to Montreal youth. they have a number of medical, social, and legal services including: Information and referrals,, Medical clinics, Legal assistance and consultations, counseling, and Workshops on legal rights, safer drug use, babysitting and other social topics such as self-esteem, body-image, and boundaries. (showing that they are a more liberal organization and likely use their money to help people ++ if that means anything).
TL:DR: how do I come up with a rate? If I DO highball it, and they say no, you think they'll be ok to negotiate for something they can work with?
Thanks a lot
Feel free to message me if you are more comfortable with that

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t speculate what they can afford. Just use your normal rate for the time for the workshop and any prep time. You can always lower it if they come back and say that it’s too much for them. If they are offering to cover it all in the first place they will be willing to negotiate.

For those who use PTEverywhere, and bill Medicare. I already have the clearing house set up, but when trying to create my CMS1500, when scrubbing it, it says I need to create an invoice first. 

Any input on what I do from here? I think I know how to create the invoice after playing around, but what do you put for the $$ for the CPT codes? Do you put what you know Medicare pays, or just an average payment, like $75 per unit or $125 or $150 for eval?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Put whatever you want to charge, more than Medicare rates, and Medicare is going to adjust it to their rates anyway. After you create the invoice for that DOS, then you can go back to the claim and scrub it

> **Response 2:** I don't use PT everywhere but you can put whatever you charge per unit. For example I charge $50 a unit and $150 for an eval. So a lot of my visits I would be charging $200 but Medicare will only pay the allowable. They automatically adjust that on the claim.

That is my set fee schedule that I use for everything so I don't have to change it around and technically I think your fee schedule is supposed to be the same for everyone.

The exception is you can offer prompt pay discounts for people who pay cash and things like that.

But hopefully someone who uses PT everywhere will chime in

I submitted a bill to BCBSIL and got the ineligible code of 503. It says “charges exceed PPO allowance. Amount is provider write-off.” What does this mean? The patient has already met her deductible but has not met her out of pocket yet. She was previously just having to pay a 20% coinsurance but her last two bills it says that she has a deductible now.

For those of you that offer packages, are patients able to submit a superbill? I have an idea of what I want to charge for a package of 8 PT visits, but do you just adjust your fee schedule based on the lower average price? And then what if they don't use all their visits before the package expires? I feel like you have to have an expiration just so people don't take advantage of the "discount" and take over a year to use all their visits. 

Would love y'alls insights! TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I know a local chiro who sells packages. Price differs depending on the number of visits, but they either last through the end of the year, or for a year, I can’t remember which. I’m limiting mine to a year. I want them to have options, particularly if they want to just have a reassess every month or so. And where I live isn’t a high income area, so allowing the extra time is an incentive and can save them money in the long run.

> **Response 2:** I give them 30 days to use the visits

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unfortunately there is no exact science for business valuation and depends on so many factors such as years in business, location, local and outside competition etc. 
Normally it is last 3 years weighted SDE or EBITDA. I have seen therapy practices sell for 2 to 3 multiples. Occasionally 4, IF the seller sees exponential growth in the future. Hope this helps.

So I went in network with Medicare and BCBS and hate all the paperwork, uncertainty, errors (my fault) that delay billing… the oops the copay was higher… I have a wait list but  I don’t want to play the game. I wanna get my $150/session in cash/card and go back to minimal paperwork…

At this point my hh job was easier (I was a rare spoiled one making good $$ working little)

So how to transition to a cash only business? Do I open a different cash only location? Close, get a job, and start weaning off job again? Do new people cash? I am lost but to stay as it is I was better off at my job…

I am looking to make a test drive going to a second location (2hs away) once a week, cash only. 

My original location takes Medicare and BCBS. This one will not. Wellness services only. I am thinking I will need a new LLC/website or do I use same? If I use same, how does google differentiate different addresses in same site?

Hello uncaged clinicians!
I have a few questions about starting to be uncaged. Three years ago since graduation I have been working at the VA which is a great job and anticipate staying at least for 7 more years till my loans are paid off. I am looking to start my own side gig,geared towards balance and vestibular patients for geriatric patients in Phoenix. My main question is how do you get started? Is this a good time for me to do this? Do I start drafting a business plan? Are there any people in this group from the Phoenix area?
I am on paternity leave right now but also in the process of moving my house, so I may be limited by time/money but just wanted some suggestions on intial steps and or potential resources that may be available.
I have loved reading about everyone’s experiences and wanted to thank everyone for your encouragement thus far!

It seems most everyone transitions from mobile to brick and mortar if starting out as a side hustle. After going brick and mortar, does anyone actually prefer mobile? I've seen it mentioned before that brick and mortar gives you more credibility and access to equipment if in a fitness studio, commercial, CF gym etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The answer is it depends. Are you building a business or are you building your own caseload? I started with mobile and now have brick and mortar. If I had the money before. I wish I started sooner. If it's just me making money, I would stick with mobile. I really wanted to scale and create systems and business so we opened up a brick and mortar. I guess what im going to is, what is really your goal? Regardless, you still win my friend. You got this!

Hi there!

I currently work in an outpatient hospital-based clinic full time and am growing my own cash-based business in my free time. 

My work has requested I develop a few policies and I am looking to pay someone willing to schedule a chat or provide resources to help me with these policy requests, and potentially future chats regarding my own LLC. 

1. Develop clinic policy to allow direct access. (My state is Oklahoma, where we are allowed to see a patient for up to 30 days without a referral). They want the actual steps to performing this (i.e. contact patient insurance first or not to see if allowed?)

2. Develop clinic policy to allow cash pay for dry needling services 

Thank you for your time!

Hi Everyone,

I will be working with multiple athletes (20+) starting next year and was wondering how you go about recommending certain things for them to get? For example, KT tape, resistance bands, stretching strap, etc. 

I came up with 2 options:
1. Create an Amazon "page" of my recommended items that I can then refer my client to go to.
2. Purchase everything on my own and sell it in-person when I see my client. Less ideal because I have to deal with inventory, but it is possible to "charge" more for this option since I am providing a convenience. 
3. This option was brought up by family: drop shipping.

Please let me know what any of you do when it comes to these types of recommendations! TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The thing is Amazon gets it to you so fast that I wouldn’t carry inventory and I would use option 2. Double the price of everything and just sell it in a bundle.

My partner and I have been able to successfully grow our business over the past 5 years. We have HH staffing, mobile part B, and 3 different locations where we deliver care in buildings. We have decided to partner with a PT who has great vision and has proven they work well with our operations, who also has great entrepreneurial drive and is business savvy. We are in the process of making them a partner, but are in the initial stages of what the terms are, who to discuss this with, and how to protect ourselves legally. I am posting for help and guidance within the community. We want the partnership, so that is not a focus point; just trying to figure out how to get things in place to protect everyone and make sure all goes as smoothly as possible. Wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar process and could share how they went about doing so. TIA.

🚀 **Is This YOUR Year to Start Your Own Practice?** 🚀

Are you ready to take the leap and build something truly *yours*? 🌟

Starting your own therapy practice isn’t rocket science, but here’s the truth: many make it harder than it needs to be by skipping one crucial step...

🔑 **Defining Your WHY.**

Clinicians often focus on the *what*—getting an LLC, launching a website—but struggle when traction doesn’t follow. The missing piece? Clarity about **why** you’re taking this journey.

✅ Your **Intrinsic Why** fuels your resilience.
✅ Your **Extrinsic Why** defines your unique value to your community.

Without these, you risk becoming “just another clinic.” But with clarity, you’ll:
✨ Stand out in a crowded market.
✨ Attract the right patients with ease.
✨ Build a practice that serves *your* vision and *their* needs.

👉 Ready to uncover YOUR Why and set out on the right path? Don’t make the journey alone—we’re here to help!

💡 **Read our latest blog to learn how to create a practice that’s true to YOU and impactful for your community:**

I’m a HHPT in NorCal thinking to start a mobile wellness business in my area for geriatric clients. I currently have a full time job I’m satisfied with but planning long term to transition to my own thing.
I am planning to eventually include both PT and wellness but for now just wellness (I don’t want to add more paperwork to my day). I’m thinking about what I can use for a name for an LLC that could work for both situations. Can I include the word “therapy” or “rehab” in my LLC name even if I’m only providing wellness?
Also, I’m thinking offering 30-45-60min visits with rates of $80-$100-$120 per session plus an additional fee for clients outside my designated area. Is this reasonable? What do people charge for a mobile wellness service in CA?

TIA

When adding a 2nd/3rd location to your private practice, what do we need to do for Medicare? Just add location on PECOS? We are sole Medicare and cash for rest. 

Our second location we don’t see many Medicare clients. Potential to add a 3rd location where a therapist goes to a gym 2x/week to see patients. 

We just added another therapist so I am feeling like I’m a pro at reassigning benefits thanks to all of this support group and Anthony Maritato videos! 🙌 thank you!

Prefacing this by saying that I have reached out to multiple lawyers and hopefully have found one that I can officially consult with, but I'd like a bit of background knowledge going into the conversation.

So for those more legally inclined group members (Iris Kimberg)....

I'm getting my ducks in a row to return to the world of cash-PT. I currently own a DE LLC that i had completed concierge visits and remote coaching and consulting for weight loss and personal training through. However since it's creation I have moved to NYS where a PLLC or PC is required to practice. 

 I’m wondering if I need to establish another separate entity, or if the original entity could DBA another in NYS? I'd rather not have to go through the whole process of building out another website, business banking, social media presence, etc. and would much prefer to merge the original DE LLC and the new professional entity if possible. 

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Even if you have to create a new LLC your website, social, and banking can all remain the same. For banking you just take in the new docs to the bank. Social has nothing to do with LLC. Website you'll just update your LLC anywhere. I'm not sure if the legalities of ny but I'd imagine you'll need one there.

Hi, I need a perspective here. I work in a setup specializing in TMJ and complex ortho. As its cash based I havent been getting consistent patients and since I am paid per patient I am not making enough money. I took to job initially as I was getting mentorship in something I wanted to specialize. Now I wish to start my own gig and owner says he feels I am trying to compete I should not be seeing tmj patients. There is no way my case load is increasing for cash pay so mostly I see one on one medicare and hence don't get paid much as it's split in percentage.  I feel bad to leave the place as I enjoy working there too. So I am in a dilemma what to do.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not to sound rude, but if you aren't getting enough patients at an already established practice, are you confident that you can going out and starting a brand new practice?

Does anyone add interest on to unpaid invoices after a certain period of time? I usually only use invoices if someone forgot their credit card or wants to wait a few days to pay, but am wondering if after 2 weeks or so a small interest rate should be added. Anyone doing this?
Any legal ramifications? Bad idea? Would need to include this in intake forms.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1) If you’re contracted with any insurers I would check your contract first because it’s probably a breach. 

2) 2 weeks seems quick but that’s just me I operate on Net 30 invoices. 

3) that fee needs to be clearly stated and signed off on by the pt. 

4) id prob brand it more as a “late fee” rather than “interest payment” patients don’t want to unknowingly enter into financing agreements. 

5) why not require a card on file?

Does anyone know when a patient submits a superbill if the insurance company reimburses anything, do they do it based on In Network or Out of Network?  Or based on the clinic's status with that insurance company?

(My company is out of network with all commercial)

Example:
INN: patient may pay 500 ded + $40 visit after
OON: patient may pay 1000 ded + 50% coins after
Self pay: Clinic rate + patient submits superbill, possible reimbursement

A local hospice center has asked us to contract with them to provide our PT services. They will be paying us directly (instead of the patient) for any services. They have asked us to send them a contract outlining payment (rates, when payment should be collected, what happens in event of patient cancellation,etc). We are not sure if there’s anything else we aren’t thinking of or if it can be as basic as that. 

Does anyone have any sample contracts similar to this that you don’t mind sharing? 

TIA! 😀

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Usually the cancellation rate is 50 percent of the charged rate.  Keep in mind they may ask ur hourly rate but book u for a half hour session which cuts it in half but usually they do that with peds for school contracts.  Congrats on the contract though!

Hi, everyone, newbee here, still leaning so pardon the question if it seems obvious.

I just saw an answer on another question that its a federal law that we can not see a Medicare patient self pay, even if we dont take Medicare so I wanted to ask....

I have a DON at a ALF who asked if I'd see a patient self pay who is on hospice services, the patient and family still want PT, is it illegal for me to see him self pay? He has a Medicare supplement policy...the family and DON said he has used all of his benefits for PT...

I read up on it and it seems that I'd have to register with Medicare as a non-participating provider and still bill Medicare to see if he can get reimbursed? Is that correct?

How much do you charge for workshops? For more context, a local group of ladies asked me to do a workshop at one of their homes. I’m a pelvic floor therapist and this group of ladies tend to have lots of kids.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How much would you have to charge to make you delighted to attend?  That could be nothing (use it as a marketing opportunity)  to $500/hour. 

The price would vary greatly depending on how far I have to travel, how difficult is the setup/prep, how much time and energy is expended, how busy I am in general,  and how much future business I expect to get out if it.

Have any of you successfully marketed for and gained clients who want an annual PT evaluation as being pushed by the APTA?
Are there actually older adults out there being proactive and seeking this service?
If they do, are you offering it as more of a free screen or actually charging for an eval?
Are you finding people who want them in the home (no way free) or people are coming to your clinic?
And if so, of the people who wanted the annual evaluation / check-up, what kind of conversion rate are you seeing for people who then sign up for a plan of care (Medicare beneficiaries vs self-pay).
*for reference, I have a mobile PT practice.

If you went from insurance to cash, how did you notify your clients of the change? Did you send an email? Give them a letter during visit? If you sent an email or sent a letter would you mind sharing it with me? 
I don’t have email of all my clients… change is happening January 1st. Felt it would give enough time to close POCs, make plans, etc. plus most people are stuck with deductibles and what not in January any way… 

Steps I thought of: 
1. Write a letter an email explaining change, what out of network means… In the letter I’d let them know of single visit price, a package that may work for them, and a special promotion… like my cash rate is $150, but current insurance patients will get a chance to pre-purchase up to 10 sessions at a much lower rate $120-130… not sure… 
2. Starting after thanksgiving I’d give the letter to everyone by the end of session (ideally I’d have time to explain, but not sure I do with every session).

Thoughts?

Ps: I will also start my cancelation policy and require a card on file to all patients as of Jan 1st (will have patient sign paperwork etc). Would love some tips on how to disclose that in the nicest way…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your clients are going to want to know why they should pay cash vs going somewhere that takes their insurance.

Change of condition report for DME. How does everyone else do them? 

This is to inform the insurance provider of a change in the patient's condition. Following a successful joint replacement in 2021, the patient has now experienced a change in health due to a CVA. The current standard rolling walker provided post-joint replacement is no longer sufficient to meet the patient's needs. Per Physical therapy recommendation, the patient now requires a U-step neurological walker to support their mobility and safety in light of this altered condition. We kindly request a reassessment of the insurance coverage for the updated medical equipment to facilitate the patient's ongoing recovery and well-being. 

Physician Signature                Date

I certify that the durable medical equipment (DME) prescribed above is medically necessary for the treatment of the patient's condition. The specific features and specifications of the prescribed equipment are essential to address the patient's functional limitations, improve mobility, and enhance overall quality of life. This medical necessity statement is based on a thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history, current health status, and the professional judgment of the prescribing healthcare provider. It is our sincere belief that the recommended DME will contribute significantly to the patient's medical care and well-being.

Question about super bills and travel fee:

I have a cash pay client that has switched to an insurance where he’ll likely be able to get out of network reimbursement. 
My super bills have always reflected my cash cash pay rate… however, I normally charge him a travel fee. My assumption is that this won’t be reimbursed if I keep my same pricing and list a travel fee. 

Do I… 

1. Increase my per unit pricing so the total is the same as I would regularly receive? As I write this it seems unethical to change? However, the per unit amount is significantly lower than what would be billed at an outpatient clinic and as clinics have different negotiated rates this seems acceptable? 
 
2. Keep pricing on my super bill the same and charge him the travel fee separately

3. Increase my pricing in general and offer those close by a discount. 

The only reason I bring up option 3 is if pricing changes draw any flags if another client has the same insurance and their super bill reflects cheaper per unit costs.

Most my clients are wellness based so I generally offer them or have as much experience with it. Thank you in advance!

Hi I am a PT in NYC and I also have a cash practice registered in NY. I have an inactive license in NJ. My friend’s dad, who resides in NJ recently moved from out of the country. He had shoulder surgery 2 weeks ago following a fall with fracture. At the moment, he is uninsured. Assuming I have a current and active license in NJ, can I see him without referral? Can I see him as cash pay? And do I have to also register my business in NJ to be able to see him? Or should he just travel to NY instead and see me here for physical therapy?

I appreciate your thoughts!

For those who charge a traveling fee, do you charge it one way or 2 ways? For example, someone wants to see me who is 30 minutes out of my range. 

Do I charge her extra JUST going to her? Or do I also charge extra to get back to my original location? This is always my debate.

I hope that makes sense.

Hi, for solo LLC (mobile, virtual/in person), I just found a space for part time use. I'm trying to find what needs to be updated. Do I need to add an additional location on npi2 account? If so, how can I do that? Currently NPI2 account has my home address and if possible, I'd like to keep it this way, since I'll be at the new location part time. 
And what about mal practice insurance? Should I list both or just a physical location? Thank you in advance.

Any advice appreciated or where I can find out state laws surrounding this.  Can I continue to see my Ca patients via telehealth when I move to NY?  Can i do it if i am just visiting and happen to have a patient who wants to meet while I am there ? Thank you yes I am licensed in both states.

Is there anything else we need to do to ensure this process is moving forward smoothly? We are still going to be using the same EIN and tax status.  Do we need to let our contracted insurance know of the DBA?

Since the state I am in requires that the practice be owned by a PT my name is going on the LLC until this persons son gets his license which wont be until Jan. They want me to market to the Drs in area. Any ideas on how you get your foot into door to speak to orthos and GP’s since it is tough to get in to see them. I usually try and touch base with office manager and see if can set up a quick 5 minute meeting to introduce myself and explain about the practice.

I currently have had about 5-6 visits per week but how long would you give that until you say okay I will consistently have 5-6 or more visits weekly. 3 months? Longer? Any feedback from those that have seen certain trends after starting their side gig (I am deciding when to make it the full time gig essentially) would be appreciated!!

Just a follow up to my original post on the one on one clinic. Was not offered position which is a bummer but have another 2 opportunities that came up. The first is a businessman who wants to open a PT facility in na area that is not inundated with facilities now. His son will be graduating from PT school next year and looks like he is doing it for him. Met with the entire family yesterday. Facility is under construction and they seem to have a good idea of what they want. Was told they want that family feeling not corporate. Acupuncture will also be part of it. No more than 2 patients an hour. Salary is within my range. They were very open to any ideas I may have and the son seemed on top of the business end with what his vision was of facility. The father has connections to the community as has owned business in area before. I have another meeting with a clinic owner this week who is looking to open a 3rd facility in my area. He has not sold his practice although says has been approached many times by the big corporations. Has been in business at least 20 years. Don’t know full details on what set up would be like salaried vs partnership. I like what I heard from first place but in back of my mind always worry about new start ups in this area. I would like to get away from the corporate companies that are all over by me amd one I am with now. I feel starting from ground up might be a good change for me.

Tax question specifically for North Carolina practice owners-

Is there a rent / lease of commercial property
that’s taxable for sales tax on rental? I believe it’s something called BTR? Business Tax Rental? 

So like if own the commercial property (your office location) in an LLC and are renting it from parent company allowing it to be be used by your LLC, is this considered a rental and is this taxed? 

Hope someone can help me here. It’s a question by my CPA who’s not based out of NC.

Very grateful to be a part of this group. 
Have been following the posts and it's been very helpful.

I'm planning on changing the clinic location and it will be a start of new lease. 
As this is my first time of changing to a new location, what does it entail? I'm OON with most insurances, and in network with MCR. 
I'm trying to make a list of all the pages and insurance plans that need to be updated but I don't want to miss on anything important while making this transition. 
Any tips/suggestions are welcome!
TIA!

Hello!
For those of you in NYS who have started an LLC:
How long after submitting articles of organization to the state did you apply for a tax EIN? I'm specifically wondering what I'd put on the EIN application for "date acquired". Would it be the date you officially file? Or the date you start business operations?
I don't plan on "officially launching" my business until Fall 2023, after my maternity leave ends, but I'm trying to get as much work done as I can before the baby comes in June. 
So, would my "date acquired" on the EIN be when I filed my LLC, or can I do a future date for when I plan to officially start making money with this business? I know EIN's are required for business bank accounts to be opened, which I'd love to do beforehand if possible.
Hope this all makes sense. Thanks all!

I am planning to charge cash and allow patient to submit their own superbill if they like. My cash rate is $125, but depending on the codes- medicare rates are around $100-118 for my services. 

-Can MA plans be charged a travel fee? I know Medicare part B cannot be charged extra for a travel fee

I am completely cash based and just received a letter from Florida blue that says “please send us the follleint: please verify which charges are to be keyed” regarding a client we treated in June.  We provided her with a superbill with this information.  Obviously I want her to be reimbursed if possible, just haven’t come across this before.  Has this happened to other clinics and do you send in a copy of the super bill? I really like just leaving it in the patients hands because 1) I’m lazy and 2) it’s their info do keep/ distribute as they please.

Thanks!

Hello
👋🏽
I originally signed up as a non-par for Medicare and I’m close to finishing my application from many years ago. If I keep this business separate from my 1099 work (which I reassigned my Medicare number) , would that be a red flag or conflict in any way ?

And as a follow up 

If I do do this  and start seeing patients that have Medicare benefits as a NON Par provider : how high can my rates go?

How close to my standard “wellness” rate does the NON PAR fee have to be. 
I understand that the reimbursement is a small percentage higher than standard Medicare rates.  Is the patient responsible for the difference or do you write it off ? 

Thank you

Question about ABN + rate 

I have a patient who wants services from me specifically but is seeing home health for speech and PT. 

Her family wants me to see her 1-2x a month really just to check in on her see if her cognition is worsening, offer any suggestions, modifications and provide cognitive stimulation/socialization. They are aware with a reduced frequency like that progress may be limited but it’s more about quality of life and having another visitor at the ALF. 

Instead of charging my private pay rate which is set pretty high can I charge a lower rate as a wellness visit? And what would I list for section D and E?

Hey y’all - for those of you that do group exercise sessions and adult daycare centers or ALFs, I have a few questions and decided to number them to keep answers organized:

1) what are your rates? 
2) does your rate depend on the size of that day’s class?
3) how long is the group session?
4) any kind of consent forms that you make each participant sign before the session and/or sign in sheet?

Anything else I need to know going into this? 

Thanks and have a great weekend!

As I am building my cash based, pediatric focused PT business, I thought I might do some Early Intervention teletherapy on the side (as a sole proprietor, not under my PLLC) as waiting lists are long and available providers are few. In order to do that, it seems I have to become an approved Medicaid provider because the state seeks reimbursement from Medicaid when they can. Will this mean that I am required to see Medicaid clients through my PLLC? The reimbursement rate is abysmally low. Does anyone know where I can look for these answers? I’m in NYS.

Hi everyone!

so my first patient is a post op ACLR+meniscus repair. He feels burdened by my rates and has mentioned that he eventually wants to transition to a personal trainer whenever that time is. Obviously, I’m worried that he will fall into the wrong hands and will not be managed appropriately especially a trainer that may have no experience with post ACL. I also do personal training as part of my business but I dont think he knows that. How would you lead the conversation to have him somehow continue working with me? For those of you that do see athletes especially post ACLR, do you have a special package? Perhaps one price for  unlimited contact, 1 in-person session a month and education towards exercise prescription?

It’s significantly lower than the direct price but there was no available add on days which I was thinking about. Anyway, if there are any women traveling alone who might consider sharing DM me.

Happy new year group!!
Is anyone here interested in selling an established and monetize YouTube channel? I already have a couple of successful physical therapy businesses, but nothing online. Looking diversify business portfolio, and believe this is the next step.
