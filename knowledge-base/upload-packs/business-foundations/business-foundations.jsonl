I’m seriously considering attempting to get something mobile started now and would like my focus to be on pregnant and postpartum mothers. I haven’t taken any classes on pregnancy but would love to. I’m not able to do this fill time but could start slow and see where it takes me. What is the reality that something like this could work? Mobile cash-based pregnant/postpartum patients. Any insight is more than welcome. Can anyone weigh in on this? I’m so over working for other people and would love to give my girl all of the attention she needs! Thank you!!!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I’d say this is definitely doable but don’t just fall for the fantasy of how great it sounds. It CAN be, but after a lot of work, even if you plan to start slowly. There will be a lot of work to go into starting a business you won’t know about til you start, even slow/part time. I did this coming back from my first mat leave and I have no regrets, but wish someone painted a realistic picture for me. It was way more work and is now the flexible venture I wanted. The end goal of working part time and being with my kiddo was possible, but the work to get it going wasn’t as simple or “part time” as I thought. I would much rather work hard for myself than someone else, but just want you to have a realistic view of what it entails. \n\nI also think you’ll need to take more coursework to adequately treat this population as a solo provider without mentorship. \n\nI’d also recommend the Business Accelerator course through Pelvic PT Rising. It’s an investment that will save you a lot of headaches and mistakes as you launch!\n\nCOMMENT 2: Definitely doable but don’t get confused, it’s not “less work” or less time."}

Do I open a different cash only location? Close, get a job, and start weaning off job again? Do new people cash? I am lost but to stay as it is I was better off at my job…"}

I am hearing up to open a brick and mortar location, with PT and sime other services.  There is a location that I am looking at in a small shopping center.  Price is good, but not really a desirable center with a 7/11 and a few other shops.  On the other hand it is very centrally located in the middle of tons of housing, next to my kids school, next to a park where all the kids play baseball and soccer.  Do you think location and reputation will make people look past the rest of the shopping center?  All advice is appreciated!\n\nCOMMENT 1: Ask the other tenants how they like being there…. And what their interaction with the landlord has been. Consider also how safe you feel coming and going there by yourself at night. Also look closely at parking. Very closely. That can be a big deal breaker for patients if the parking is sparse, or they have to walk far to get to your suite.\n\nCOMMENT 2: Always remember. Location. Location. Location.

Doesn't hurt to throw things out there if you haven't already!\n\nCOMMENT 2: Write in a back out clause. We have been in business a long time sign every 5 years.   Our back out is a 6 month notice. No penalty."}

He's also one of the fastest and has a ridiculously good throwing arm with great accuracy.  Unfortunately, his coaches won't give him a chance at QB because of his size, and the kid they play at QB isn't accurate enough to throw long passes.  Last game, I watched my son start to give up.  He was sitting on the sideline with tears in his eyes, trying not to cry and visibly sinking in to sadness.  He was avoiding looking at me so that he didn't melt completely in to tears, but at one point he glanced at me and I mouthed \"it's ok\" and pointed at my heart and back at him.  His coach I think noticed his change in temperment, too, and a few minutes later he was put in on defense.  I can only assume that he was told to rush the quarterback, because as soon as the ball was snapped my son forced him back 10 yards.  The next play, he did it again.  And his entire body changed after that.  He held his head up, he smiled, he started enjoying it again.\nAfter the game, I pulled him aside and said \"listen to me.  There are going to be times that you don't get the shot you think you deserve.  And in those times, you'll have 2 choices.  You can give up and stop trying, and that's ok.  You can make that choice.  But if you do that, no one will ever give you that chance again.  Or, you can choose to go back out and prove to the doubters why they should've believed in you in the first place.  And that's what you did today.  You made them see why they have to give you a chance.  Because you're worth it.\"\nToday has been discouraging, and frustrating, and a little teary on my end.  But I've replayed that conversation in my head a few times, and decided to listen to myself.\nIt's SUPER hard to start a small business, especially when you're competing with 100 other options.  But it's our job to bounce back and prove why we can't be ignored.", "comments": [{"text": "We have so much to learn from our kids and how we choose to guide them through life.

He's also one of the fastest and has a ridiculously good throwing arm with great accuracy.  Unfortunately, his coaches won't give him a chance at QB because of his size, and the kid they play at QB isn't accurate enough to throw long passes.  Last game, I watched my son start to give up.  He was sitting on the sideline with tears in his eyes, trying not to cry and visibly sinking in to sadness.  He was avoiding looking at me so that he didn't melt completely in to tears, but at one point he glanced at me and I mouthed \"it's ok\" and pointed at my heart and back at him.  His coach I think noticed his change in temperment, too, and a few minutes later he was put in on defense.  I can only assume that he was told to rush the quarterback, because as soon as the ball was snapped my son forced him back 10 yards.  The next play, he did it again.  And his entire body changed after that.  He held his head up, he smiled, he started enjoying it again.\nAfter the game, I pulled him aside and said \"listen to me.  There are going to be times that you don't get the shot you think you deserve.  And in those times, you'll have 2 choices.  You can give up and stop trying, and that's ok.  You can make that choice.  But if you do that, no one will ever give you that chance again.  Or, you can choose to go back out and prove to the doubters why they should've believed in you in the first place.  And that's what you did today.  You made them see why they have to give you a chance.  Because you're worth it.\"\nToday has been discouraging, and frustrating, and a little teary on my end.  But I've replayed that conversation in my head a few times, and decided to listen to myself.\nIt's SUPER hard to start a small business, especially when you're competing with 100 other options.  But it's our job to bounce back and prove why we can't be ignored.\n\nCOMMENT 1: We have so much to learn from our kids and how we choose to guide them through life. Just know you're being an amazing example in every way, especially having the courage to start and flourish in your own business. I have a 4 and 6 year old and started 2 years ago\n\nCOMMENT 2: Love that! Also, remind the coach that Stetson Bennett didn’t get a chance to play QB either, and then won Back 2 Back Natties!"}

I myself  trade futures in the market. I feel it’s the best skill in the world but the hardest one to learn but if you master it you are golden. I only trade 1-3 hours in the evening, last night was great, I made more than double on 2 trades than working 10 hour shift as charge nurse with weekend differential lol. But it’s a skill like any other that you need to learn. Affiliate marketing, selling life insurance on the side, digital products are some other side hustles that our healthcare friends do for extra income. Feel free to DM me."}

We have moved to a salary plus commission model.  So they get their base salary for what we expect a normal caseload with cancellations will be and then they make commission for any sessions completed over and above that number.  When we do annual raises and holiday bonuses this is also factored in.  This incentivizes therapists who want to make more money to fill up their schedule.\n\nCOMMENT 2: 🙋‍♀️ We have a base visits per week that they are ‘salaried’ on and then anything over that, they get an additional bonus per visit over their base.

TIA!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I looked into it. Read the fine print. And check out the fee rates, they’ll take a pretty penny from you. You’ll have to decide for yourself, I got signed up and decided to never use it.\n\nCOMMENT 2: They charge you 8-13% transaction fees.  But we do accept it.  We do not allow for package discounts if a client uses care credit."}

I have been seeing clients privately for 25 years. I have a good referral source in place and am ready to expand a bit. I have 3 therapists, who I know very well and are ready to take any referrals I can’t handle time-wise.  \nMy plan is to do the marketing, get the referrals, see the client for the initial evaluation/consultation, get payment for a Package of sessions, and then assign them to an appropriate therapist. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1.  What’s the best way to set up this relationship (I’m in California)?\n\n2. I will have them sign the document declaring they are a separate business (I forgot the name of it). \n\n3. How should I pay them (Venmo, Zelle vs check etc)?\n\n4. What % of the total fee that I collect should I pay them?\n \n5. Do I 1099 my payments to them?\n\nAnd there’s probably some considerations/ legal items I’m not thinking about as well. I’m open to suggestions!\n\nThank you!", "comments": [{"text": "I would definitely pay by check & hopefully they will understand they would be independent contractors since they will be 1099’d at the end of the year. (I think I read that Venmo was going to start reporting when someone received more than $600/year from one source to the government & that might create a nightmare for the IC).

I have been seeing clients privately for 25 years. I have a good referral source in place and am ready to expand a bit. I have 3 therapists, who I know very well and are ready to take any referrals I can’t handle time-wise.  \nMy plan is to do the marketing, get the referrals, see the client for the initial evaluation/consultation, get payment for a Package of sessions, and then assign them to an appropriate therapist. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1.  What’s the best way to set up this relationship (I’m in California)?\n\n2. I will have them sign the document declaring they are a separate business (I forgot the name of it). \n\n3. How should I pay them (Venmo, Zelle vs check etc)?\n\n4. What % of the total fee that I collect should I pay them?\n \n5. Do I 1099 my payments to them?\n\nAnd there’s probably some considerations/ legal items I’m not thinking about as well. I’m open to suggestions!\n\nThank you!\n\nCOMMENT 1: I would definitely pay by check & hopefully they will understand they would be independent contractors since they will be 1099’d at the end of the year. (I think I read that Venmo was going to start reporting when someone received more than $600/year from one source to the government & that might create a nightmare for the IC). The % of the total fee would depend on how much “extra work” you’re needing to do ie billing, marketing, accounting etc. I pay my IC’s 80% of what I (my company) receives as payment.

She mentioned taking 20% of each visit for my patients and 50% of each visit when I see her patients. My patients are defined as anyone I bring in (for example, if I treat one of my mobile patients in the office) and her patients are anyone who calls to see her (so if someone calls to see her and learns of the 6 month wait list and doesn't want to wait, she'll direct them to me). 50% seems really high to me so I'm curious to get other's opinion's on this! For context, she has a great reputation, >20 years experience, has mentioned she'd be willing to teach me in some specialized areas and otherwise is very flexible with no min number of days/hours required and I would still work for myself. That being said, it's still 50% for a finders fee and I would be doing all of the work with the patient. Since I'm just going from side hustle to full time, I am a bit nervous about building up a case load and this would be one way that could majorly help with that.

When you are just starting out as your own business, it may seem as if the therapist is doing all the work(providing care to the pt and completing the documentation) and yes this is the revenue for the business. However, you need to realize how much goes into the greater picture of running a business than just treating patients and as many people in this group are just starting out, the full picture isn't visible yet(it wasn't for me until this year as I decide to grow my business with additional team members, services, products). As she is a business owner of a brick and mortar clinic, >20 years of experience, high reputation and an impressive 6 month waiting list, she has done EVERYTHING!  She has put in her time, effort, risk, sleepless nights, 60-80 hr work weeks, covering any shift a staff can't, learning HR/bookkeeping/accounting/compliance/risk mngmt/leadership and the cost/time each entails, mistakes in hiring/pricing/policies/EMRs/risk mngmt/scheduling, overcoming and improving on her processes to avoid those same mistakes in the future, cost of property, marketing and advertising,  paying staff instead of herself probably during slow times and so MUCH more!!!  She is also taking a risk on bringing any practitioner or employee into a business she has built for 20 yrs. Her profit margin is not 50% if she pays you 50%. If the business runs on a 5-10% profit margin and she pays a % higher to her team, that's a significant loss in the margin, so as the CEO, that comes out of her CEO salary so to speak. The COST of Attraction, Aquisition and Retention has been Tens of thousands each year for 20 years in addition to overhead costs of admin, environment, etc. We, as a profession, are kind, good-willed humans, and we can be that while being a business owner also, which includes setting your boundaries on what it is worth to the owner to continue running the business. Referring patients out would be giving away her very hard earned Attraction and Aquisition potential to only to give it to someone else for their profit. There is a great likelihood that referring them to someone like a new Uncaged clinician, she will not get them back because that Uncaged member is going to do everything in their power to retain that client, right?  So then she would have worked for years on Attraction and Aquistion(the most costly for the owner) only to give the source of revenue to someone else. That first phone call can make or break a client, so that's the most important call, that's when you get the commitment from the client. For the same reason becoming Uncaged is risky, is the very reason she must work her numbers wisely. Imagine working diligently to get your schedule up to your first 10 clients, your max,  and having to give them to someone else for no return on investment to you. She has INVESTED 20 years of building trust and respect of the community!  Huge accomplishment! Congratulations to her!  Now you just have to decide if you want to be part of what she has already built or if you are ready/willing/capable of doing the same.   Either way, choose what is right for you. Respect the process. Even if you were to work with her and didn't appreciate the numbers, you may be able to learn lots just being involved in her system with your new frame of mind as a new business owner. The whole point, there's another side to the coin. Thanks for letting me share.

I was approached by a local PT who has a booming business (>6 month wait list) to work in her office (still be my own biz owner). She mentioned taking 20% of each visit for my patients and 50% of each visit when I see her patients. My patients are defined as anyone I bring in (for example, if I treat one of my mobile patients in the office) and her patients are anyone who calls to see her (so if someone calls to see her and learns of the 6 month wait list and doesn't want to wait, she'll direct them to me). 50% seems really high to me so I'm curious to get other's opinion's on this! For context, she has a great reputation, >20 years experience, has mentioned she'd be willing to teach me in some specialized areas and otherwise is very flexible with no min number of days/hours required and I would still work for myself. That being said, it's still 50% for a finders fee and I would be doing all of the work with the patient. Since I'm just going from side hustle to full time, I am a bit nervous about building up a case load and this would be one way that could majorly help with that. Does anyone else practice in a similar model? What % split seems fair and reasonable given this situation? I'd love to hear all thoughts an opinions! Thanks\n\nCOMMENT 1: When you hire someone you plan to pay them 30-50% of the revenue they bring in. It sounds like she’s looking at it like you’re an employee\n\nCOMMENT 2: I can understand why this may sound as if the price is skewed to her benefit, but IT SHOULD BE!

Contact a health insurance broker.\n\nCOMMENT 2: One option is to check your state’s health insurance marketplace (the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare). See if there are insurance brokers associated with it who can help you look at plans on the marketplace (the brokers are no cost to you) and ask them if you might qualify for tax credits which lessen your monthly cost. I did this after a layoff and was pleasantly surprised about the affordability - though I’m not getting family coverage so can’t speak to that part."}

Wanted to get a sense of what I should be asking for a workshop I may potentially do. \nIt's not meant to make bank or promote an offer. just trying to help people out with some information.\nIf I would do it on my own, it would be really informal and I would have done it at a low cost for the participants and hope to get at least 30 people attending for 10 dollars each.\nI am in talks with an organization (in Montreal, Canada) that is interested to join me for it. If I contract it to the non profit, I can choose my rate and hope they have the budget for it. They will not be charging the participants. So i don't want to highball it but don't want to lowball it.\nIt will take some prep on my part and be about 90 minutes. \nDo I charge my hourly rate (That people pay to see me)? because that may be too high for them to afford. but I also don't know how much they can afford. I don't want to name them but for context, this non profit provides medical, legal and social services to Montreal youth. they have a number of medical, social, and legal services including: Information and referrals,, Medical clinics, Legal assistance and consultations, counseling, and Workshops on legal rights, safer drug use, babysitting and other social topics such as self-esteem, body-image, and boundaries. (showing that they are a more liberal organization and likely use their money to help people ++ if that means anything).\nTL:DR: how do I come up with a rate?

Wanted to get a sense of what I should be asking for a workshop I may potentially do. \nIt's not meant to make bank or promote an offer. just trying to help people out with some information.\nIf I would do it on my own, it would be really informal and I would have done it at a low cost for the participants and hope to get at least 30 people attending for 10 dollars each.\nI am in talks with an organization (in Montreal, Canada) that is interested to join me for it. If I contract it to the non profit, I can choose my rate and hope they have the budget for it. They will not be charging the participants. So i don't want to highball it but don't want to lowball it.\nIt will take some prep on my part and be about 90 minutes. \nDo I charge my hourly rate (That people pay to see me)? because that may be too high for them to afford. but I also don't know how much they can afford. I don't want to name them but for context, this non profit provides medical, legal and social services to Montreal youth. they have a number of medical, social, and legal services including: Information and referrals,, Medical clinics, Legal assistance and consultations, counseling, and Workshops on legal rights, safer drug use, babysitting and other social topics such as self-esteem, body-image, and boundaries. (showing that they are a more liberal organization and likely use their money to help people ++ if that means anything).\nTL:DR: how do I come up with a rate? If I DO highball it, and they say no, you think they'll be ok to negotiate for something they can work with?\nThanks a lot\nFeel free to message me if you are more comfortable with that\n\nCOMMENT 1: Don’t speculate what they can afford.

I structure it typically for 60-75 min treatments and 90 minute evals and have been ramping up to 3-4 visits a week. So right now I am still pretty dependent on the income for those visits to replace the days not at the SNF (6 visits/wk is break even with expenses) I  heavily use counterstrain as a manual technique and that is generally what brings in the clients. The colleague/mentor who introduced me to this technique and had a part time cash practice recently told me they were moving out of state and said she would recommend her clients to see me when they needed therapy. Then, she also connected with a retired PT in the area who reached out who owned several insurance base clinics in the past and extensively studied counterstrain and was certified in it. At our first meeting, he mentioned that he isn’t getting satisfaction doing PRN 1-2 days a week for SNFs and doesn’t want all his knowledge with counterstrain to go to waste with him retiring.

I structure it typically for 60-75 min treatments and 90 minute evals and have been ramping up to 3-4 visits a week. So right now I am still pretty dependent on the income for those visits to replace the days not at the SNF (6 visits/wk is break even with expenses) I  heavily use counterstrain as a manual technique and that is generally what brings in the clients. The colleague/mentor who introduced me to this technique and had a part time cash practice recently told me they were moving out of state and said she would recommend her clients to see me when they needed therapy. Then, she also connected with a retired PT in the area who reached out who owned several insurance base clinics in the past and extensively studied counterstrain and was certified in it. At our first meeting, he mentioned that he isn’t getting satisfaction doing PRN 1-2 days a week for SNFs and doesn’t want all his knowledge with counterstrain to go to waste with him retiring. He told me his goal was to help my business grow and be able to pass on his knowledge. He mentioned money wasn’t important since he was retired and if I wanted to utilize him, then pay him what I felt he is worth. Of course with his business knowledge and clinical knowledge, my first thought was there was no way I can afford what he is worth.
