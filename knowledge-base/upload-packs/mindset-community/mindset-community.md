Idk why but this became a place I feel safe to celebrate financial wins. 

I’m excited!, 

I do feel like a money launderer (the good kind) that redistributed my income  Lol. I need a budgeting class… 2023 goals. 

These are net numbers.  I work 3 -4 days a week, it’s just me in a small clinic and I took a few months off this year for surgeries. I’ve never paid for any marketing and don’t have a team ..yet 🙂

My highest month was prior to starting any of my online programs. I diversified my time between patient care and my sexual wellness work, but for me it’s been so worth it to do the things I love. ❤️

I don’t think women talk about money enough, or what is possible in a positive way. 

Money is one example of success, it isn’t the most important factor and many factors play into why this might be possible for one person and not another. 

But, I am excited!

Money is a place I want to work on this year and have a sense of pride, empowerment and more conversations about. 

It begins by sharing, even though it’s rather scary. It begins with one foot in gratitude for where I am and one excited for my future. ❤️

Eeeeeeee

I’m proud of my bravery, the money I’ve earned and the way I’ve earned it with social justice practices in mind. 

Help me celebrate 😋

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m sitting here feeling so darn excited for you & super proud of you! And I don’t even know you! 
Thanks so much for stepping out to share this!

> **Response 2:** A-MAZING!! Congratulations Sara!! And thanks for sharing!! 🙌🏼

NO BRAIN BLEEDS FOR EITHER GIRL!!!!!!! THANK YOU PRAYER WARRIORS!!!! 

Hi Uncaged Clinicians. Not sure if this is allowed, but we are asking for prayers for our twin girls born last week at 23 weeks. They are receiving great care in the NICU, but we have a big ultrasound test to scan for brain bleeds tomorrow. Would you pray for clean scans tomorrow? The girls have already showed us they are little fighters, but we would appreciate any prayer warriors out there to join us in praying for God's protection over their little bodies.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your twin girls are absolutely in our prayers 🙏🏻

> **Response 2:** Prayers for your twins 🙏🙏🙏

I’m at my daughter’s track meet. Stretch lab is packed and the physical therapy company is empty. #ZoomIn

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What a great message to help so many of us understand that simply selling physical therapy is not the way to go! This picture is gold

> **Response 2:** The thing is I don't think Ivy or the therapist who was supposed to be there actually cares. This isn't their target demographic.

I paid myself a bonus today. I’ve been working my ass off, going at 100% and finally achieved my goal for a minimum in my bank account ( I’m 2 years old). The bonus was only $1000 but the most I’ve ever gotten from an employer was a $25 Starbucks card so I’ll take this as a big win!

**Original Post:**
Curious what others think…I believe that timed billing codes is one of the worst things for our profession, and we are basically the only profession that has them.  It diminishes our value, and dictates how we treat if we want to make any money.  If I have a post op shoulder patient, I can do very effective joint mobilization and PROM in 15 minutes, but why should I get paid less for that visit, than if I make someone do a bunch of exercises with some supervision.  Times codes are forcing PTs to do fillers to waste time so that they can get decent reimbursement, even if it isn’t necessary, or even if it isn’t in patients best interest.  I think this is the number one thing the APTA should focus on, if anyone here is active in it.  Very curious what others think please!  Thanks, I’ll get off my soap box now…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like you are a business owner. Assuming you are, you are in the best position to create what you want. 
...
Reading through the comments and your responses it sounds like 1.) you want to earn more money, 2.) you want to deliver a better patient care experience, and 3.) you want to do it at a price point that you would pay if you were the patient. 
...
Does that sound about right?
...
Rather than focusing on someone else changing a system that won't likely change in our lifetime, why not put that energy into something you can control more easily. 
...
Create the business that solves the problems you want to solve. 
...
Look at business models outside of healthcare that are already achieving these goals. 
...
Starbucks is a bank that sells overpriced coffee. A standard coffee shop can't compete because they are trying to operate in a failing business model. 
...
Facebook and Google make hundreds of billions on selling what people give them for free.
...
Barnes and Nobel survived and is opening 30 new stores despite Amazon's attack on book sales because of their are a real estate holdings business. 
...
I can run a profitable therapy business because it is secretly a media company and billing company that also delivers therapy services. I can profitably deliver services at far lower costs while still paying my staff higher than average rates because I understand the objective of my business model.

> **Response 2:** One of the thousand reasons why I'm a cash provider!

**Original Post:**
I only post these things not to brag because my success has been minimal compared to most, but it’s just so I can hopefully help other people drop the imposter syndrome that I was holding onto for a while and realize that there are people out there that really value what we do. 

I just had a self-pay patient give me a $20 tip randomly. I charged this person $130 for a 45 min visit and they gave me a tip. 

This wasn’t coming from an extremely wealthy person. From what I can tell they aren’t struggling, but life isn’t easy peasy. So for them to value my service so much that they were like, you know what, you’re worth more, was a little eye opening. 

I asked if they were sure they didn’t want change. 

The patient’s response: Don’t worry about the change. You deserve a tip. You’re worth every penny. I’m so glad that I found you!

Ya’ll… this kind of blew my mind a bit. 

EVERYONE, PLEASE don’t under value yourself! 

It doesn’t matter what this insurance or that thinks we are worth. It doesn’t matter what Johnny PT Mill down the road or the other PP PT clinic close by sets their prices at.

Set your price and deliver quality care. People will recognize the difference and the word will spread. Let the mills do their mill thing while you take the time to have real life changing results with your people.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a patient’s daughter take me out to lunch today…. Quite $$ and pay me my visit rate to discuss how her mom is doing and what her needs might be. Yes. These people exist. It’s amazing when you get out of the insanity how clear that becomes.

> **Response 2:** This is awesome. I’m launching this week and really struggling with feeling that imposter syndrome. Thanks for the encouragement.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Just curious, I am trying to do the same thing in my detached garage. What is going to be the entrance for your clients, through the house. I have so much anxiety about starting in my garage, thinking people will think its unprofessional. I am ecstatic that I see someone else trying to make a go of it in that space! Best of luck!!!!!!🙏🏻

Hi everyone! Has anyone ever built a home office shed to treat out of? I’ve been looking into renting office space (I’m currently out of a gym) but there is something appealing about having people come to me. I have a basement we could renovate but also like the idea of having more separation. I would love to pick someone’s brain on this! ☺️

**Community Responses:**

If anyone out there needs a sign to make the move and schedule a call with the UNCAGED team, this is it! 

As I am having my morning coffee(s) I realized that yesterday I actually sat down and had breakfast with my husband, ran multiple errands, was able to take my dogs for a 30 minute walk in the middle of the day, treated patients how they DESERVE to be treated, had our weekly Mastermind call, and was done working by 3…all while making much more than I would have working in a ‘caged’ job. 

Being UNCAGED is not just about making more money, it is about having the freedom to choose how you spend your day, while providing our patients with the care that they deserve. 🙌🏼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Kelsey Harris, THIS. RIGHT. HERE.  
THIS IS WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!!! 🙌💪❤️

Beyond this, you have absolutely SSSMMMMASHED IT out of the park. 
SOOOOO pumped for what you have built out of believing in yourself ❤️❤️

> **Response 2:** The flexibility and freedom is the best 🙌

**Community Responses:**

Still facing appeals.
Was generally not being enforced anyway. 

Don’t know why in this country we can’t just do what we are trying to do. Always have to muddy it up David Bayliff

If it holds it will certainly help some folks in lower income bracket. I was surprised to know that in some cases hairdresser and restaurant workers had non-compete 🤦‍♂️

> **Response 2:** We’ve always had NDA’s in our San Francisco clinic for our IP but never NCs. 

There’s always enough business to feed everyone extremely well. 

It’s an abundance mindset.

Hello everyone, 
I am anonymously posting this to avoid having issues at my current full time job. 
I want to know if it is actually possible to go solo with an LLC, mostly do cash based and grow at least to a decent salary?
Who has done this?
Who has made it happen in the last year?
I would like to hear from you please. 

I am sure a lot of us in this group are working full time in a busy private practice, tired of seeing 12 + patients a day and thinking..... is there something better out there?
Can I make it on my own?

Please share your experiences, if it has worked for you, what is your current success story or if it has not worked for you. 

I am just trying to make life decisions at this moment and would love to hear from PTs that felt caged in and where able to uncage themselves. 

Thank you so much in advance :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got uncaged when I got fired. So I didn't have any choice but to make it work. 😭😭😭 Now I'm caged again in our clinic. Lol. 

Kidding aside, like what Anthony Maritato mentioned. You already know the science of therapy. What you need to learn is the art and science of marketing yourself to the public. 

Like what the great Captain David Bayliff said. Be famous in your community and be so popular that people will say, huh, I want to go to that amazing therapist. And also stop posting anonymously too. 😁😁😁 just kidding. 

You got this! You go get it my friend! 🔥🔥🔥

> **Response 2:** I see about 12-15 pts a week, working 3 days a week. On track for a 100k+ year. I’m coming up on my 3rd anniversary this November. 

I keep overhead low. I rent a small space. I don’t work every week and take off lots of days to manage my kids and their school schedules. 

It’s possible.

Today I let my boss know that I will be leaving my position and I will be 100% invested in my own company. I was not working there currently but still employed in case I wanted to pick up any shifts when business was slow. I now feel confident that I will make my company work. There may be some slow times in my future but I will take that time to continue to grow my business. I know one thing is for sure I do not want to work for anyone else. Thanks for all the help from this group!

**Original Post:**
I've only been an OT for 4 years and I'm burnt out as I suffer from imposter syndrome. (I'm short and look young)  I am ready to get out of this field due to my personal mental health, political red tapes, productivity standards, and decreased quality of life. 

I know a RN who did the acupuncture master program and started her own acupuncture, massage and sound bath wellness clinic. 
I would like to go into wellness and start cashpay (higher pay, less oversight) 

What kind of services can I offer other than "teach patients to get better at ADLs"

It seems like ppl are prone to spend money on positive experience and something that makes them "feel good" instead being told what to do by therapist. 

Appreciate any insight, recommendations on ceu/class or programs to embark on my new journey.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you everyone for taking the time out of your day to help me brainstorm. 
I'm the first person in my family to attend college and do not have a mentor in personal or professional development. 

You are all asking the right questions to help me guide my career, I hope to find the right answer based on everyone's experience and wisdom. Appreciate you all for sharing.

Stopping in to leave a very Biased opinion. I just hit my first huge month since going full time in my mobile business. I attribute a ton if it to the wisdom and advice of David Bayliff!!! 
He has helped me every step of the way! 

Taught me how to approach other professionals with a serving attitude instead of what can they do for me! 

Explained how to use word of mouth to grow!

**Original Post:**
2012.  Review time.

We all dread those meetings with our superiors.

We are required to fill out forms answering questions about how WE think we have been performing.  Then, we are asked about our goals over the next 6 months and 1 year.

After 18 years of showing up to this rodeo, I knew that MY goals didn’t matter - unless they were to attend certain CEU courses, increase my units/visit charged, and to see more patients.

How did I think I did?

Well, I think I got a lot of people better, back to living their lives, and happy that they had me as a therapist.

However, you tell me, Mr. Director.

This review was probably like ones you have been through.  And not unlike most others I had experienced.

There was the discussion that if I added just three more exercises to the patient’s (ther-ex) program at least every other day, how it would positively impact my yearly bonus.

Speaking of adding exercises, this would also help to get my average units/visit up.  This would get me out of “last place” for the entire company.

My director then requested that I start documenting each week as to why a patient did not attend treatments 3x/wk for that week.  If a patient was discharged, give justification because everyone needed to be seen at a minimum of 15 visits.

As far as documentation went, I needed to get my discharges done sooner.

The response to my goals: “Well, I think those are some good goals.”

Period.

The final outcome:

I wasn’t going to get my full 2% raise because of my shortcomings on the metrics.

You know, the ones that had ZERO to do with patients improving, meeting THEIR goals (which they did).  The goals which they expected us (me) to help them to achieve.

No 2% raise because I focused too much on the patients.

There were many straws during my last 5-6 years with the Establishment.  This was the last one.

However, what was I to do?

I was done with the long hours.

I was done with the endless paperwork.

I was certainly done dealing with the insurance companies.

But, what else was there for me as a therapist?  Being a PT was all I knew.

That was when a patient asked me if I would like to take over for a person who worked with residents in her community.  This individual was moving out of state.  She felt that I was the perfect fit.

Without hesitation I said: “Heck YEAH!”

Scared, nervous, anxious, worried, excited?

Yep.  All of the above.

I didn’t know what I was doing.  No one else was doing this sort of thing.  But I did know one thing: I believed in me.

Where did that decision take me?

I was able to move out of a one bedroom apartment and into a house.  This meant that my kids would now have their own bedrooms.  (BTW, the demands of corporate healthcare were the catalyst to my divorce.)

I was now able to save a little money each month.

I took time off when I wanted.  My clients didn’t mind.  They supported my taking time to myself.

I attended my kids’ school events.

And I got to focus on what mattered the most about being a therapist - helping people to achieve THEIR goals.

Now, I am blessed to work alongside my friends, Josh and Kevin, to help other clinicians break free from the corporate world, and to become uncaged in their own lives - personally and professionally.

I know that making such a decision is probably the hardest one you will ever make; more so than choosing a partner or spouse.

That is why at UNCAGED we walk with you step-by-step.

We are the safety net beneath you until your wings are strong enough to carry you.

Summer is around the corner.  It’s a great time to learn how to spread those wings.

The nerves are understandable.  Let us help you sort those out.

Hey friends. I had a new patient come in this week with bed bugs literally crawling on her. I picked them off and smashed them between my fingers as I saw them 😫. I felt bad because she was embarrassed and admitted she’s had a bug problem. Turns out, she lives in an apartment where my bug guy says is “bed bug heaven”. I don’t know what the ethical and legal thing to do is. She needs PT but I can’t be putting my clinic, my home and my patient’s homes at risk. Also, I have another new patient on my waiting list who lives in the same building. Bed bugs can be next to impossible to get rid of. Anyone have experience with this kind of situation?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ooo I have gotten bed bugs from patients before, and I am very passionate about this subject! I have worked for a few different clinics and agencies that say different things. The one that infuriates me the most is that we cannot discriminate because they have bed bugs. The one that makes the most sense is that we cannot see them until they no longer have an infestation, because it is a contamination. It is unrelated to their personal hygiene and cleanliness, and they can travel so easily. You don't want them in your carpet, or climbing up others patients legs. The first time I got them from a patient, it took 6 months to get out! It sucks because it is really embarrassing, and such a challenging thing to control, but you have to think about the clinic as a whole. You wouldn't let someone with a cute covid come in without a mask or any protection, because it could infect you and other patients, right? I would transition her to virtual appointments if possible.

> **Response 2:** Legally they classify as having contact precautions when there is visual bedbugs. So room isolation and gowns, gloves and hair/foot protection is advisable. Just like if they’re in a hospital, contact is contact.

Hey all - some of you know me well, others don't but I'm trying hard to push to win this this year. If you don't mind taking literally a minute to vote for us as best PT in Pensacola I would appreciate it!

There is literally a chiropractor leading the way who does not employ a physical therapist! Technically this is illegal but whatever. 

Please help me prevent this and help me win it!

So, get this: Samuel anointed David to be king right in front of his dad and brothers. Can you believe it? 

They didn't believe in him and even left him out in the fields with the sheep when Samuel came around. 

And to top it off, his own brothers made fun of him and tried to bring him down. But David didn't let their negativity get to him. 

Same thing happened to me. Not that I was sold into slavery. Lol. But I do have a lot of haters, plenty of people who doubted me, family who don't like me and etc etc etc... Just because...

Here is the thing. If you show that you can ignore the haters and trust in God. He'll bless you in front of those who tried to push you down. God knows how to throw a party for you right in front of your enemies. He's not going to promote you in secret, but He'll promote you where those who doubted you will see you shine like a star. 

Listen, it's important to be respectful to others, but don't let their doubts and negativity cancel out what God has put in your heart. Just ignore all that noise and get ready to see the greatness of God. Trust me, it's gonna be epic.

I’ve been getting a lot of DMs about shockwave therapy things like which device to choose, how to approach certain conditions, and which courses are actually worth the time , sorry I am unable to answer all of them . Since many of us are exploring similar things, I thought it might be helpful to hop on a casual Zoom call and discuss as a group.
No agenda just an open, supportive chat to share experiences and support each other . If you’re interested, DM me and I , I’ll set it up!

I’m doing research on red light therapy, have never used it, debating if I want to add that to my mobile practice. A chiropractor I met sent me this link. Does anyone know about these products at this website? They claim to use a different technology than traditional red light therapy.  Has anyone had success with red light therapy for mobile use? TIA


**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use it and love it. I actually have really good reviews from patients on it. My mom broke her wrist and had an ORIF last year. She can't take pain meds and she pretty much wore my vibe constantly and it was the only thing that helped her pain.

The first thing I noticed was all of the ice plunges…

So, I’ve deliberately tried hard to spend less time on social media lately, both posting and consuming…

A little bit of margin from it, made something abundantly clear to me.

When you scroll through social media land, I’m struck by the amount of posts and stories about people’s daily lives, their morning routines, ice plunges, workouts they do, things they eat, etc. 

We cover it with a noble facade of “I’m motivating others around me.”, but I believe it reveals something much deeper…

It reveals that this generation is constantly looking to be validated by our peers and by the world. An outward facade of “I’m trying to motivate others” is actually covering up an inward feeling of “I want others to think I’m special”.

I’m not being mean, just truthful. I promise this ends very positively. 

But think about it - Men, who want SO badly to be “hard” and to be seen as men, because they were never told by their Fathers that they are…
- Post nonstop about their workouts
- Their ice plunges
- Their discipline that they want to show the world.

The problem is: True resilience and strength will actually come if that same man, would stop looking for validation from the world, and continue with their routines in silence.

Just them, and their routines, doing it for the betterment of themselves, the betterment of themselves as a Father, and as a husband. Without a need to post it. Constantly seeking validation from others is actually what’s stopping this generation from truly growing internally as men and women…

And the ultimate problem is this: You are already worthy. You have been made in the image of Christ. You have nothing to prove and everything to gain from seeing that your true identity is as a beloved son and daughter of Christ.

So, let’s put our phones down. Let’s stop looking for validation from the world, and start looking toward our Father in Heaven. The world will never give you what only the Father can.

The best growth comes when all of those things are done in the secret place, without any “want” or “need” in you to post it for others to see. But, only for your Father in Heaven to see. It will free your soul.

Good morning fellow practitioners! I’m a PTA and have been considering going back to school to do my DPT and I have 2 questions: 

1) any schools you suggest that either has a bridge program or a hybrid program that most of program can be done online? 

2) is it worth going back for? 

I’m fully open to any suggestions or advice anyone has! 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would encourage anyone and everyone not to go into PT until direct access is fully granted, and reimbursement increases significantly.  The tuition cost and time commitment to become a PT is definitely not worth the pay and grueling hours.

> **Response 2:** Not worth it. For what you pay in tuition (student loans) will not be comparable to your salary which is less and less each year. If I had to do it over, I’d taken the PA route.

You got into this profession for a reason. It wasn't easy to get through school. It wasn't easy to make the sacrifices that you made but you still did it for a reason. 

Then you got jaded. A bad boss, frustrating work experience, etc put you in a position that you felt burnt out. 

Now you're searching for how to fix the burn out and you're incessantly marketed to that MONEY is going to solve your problem. 

It won't.

It might be a salve on the pain for a bit but that isn't going to get you back to why you did what you did in the first place. Why you made all the sacrifices and did all the work. 

Businesses should be created so you can reengage with the why and passion you had for loving, serving, caring for and leading other in the first place. Not so you can get over your jaded attitude by making more money.

As I’ve made more money and been around people who make a lot of money I feel it’s important to remind people that the people who make a ton of money have the same core problems you do. Yet so often we chase money as though it’ll fix root issues in our mindset, families, friendships, health, faith, etc 

Please don’t fall victim to that belief.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dropping bombs 💣

> **Response 2:** Bravo. I cringe occasionally at the “prosperity gospel” messaging I see in this group, and others, online. And I would like to add a perspective “from the other side” if you will: after working in the PT industry for years, in the 90s i had gone back to school for a post-professional doctorate and opened a private practice. Huge success, dreams coming true left and right, then in spring 2001 my life partner was diagnosed with cancer. He died two weeks after 9/11. And suddenly none of that success meant anything. There was NO amount of money that could have kept him with me, and I would have paid ANY amount of money for just 5 more minutes. And not a single minute of all of those weeks, months, years of spending 50,60,70+ hours/week working, studying, away from home could be reclaimed. I was 38yo! Please be mindful about what you wish for. Honor the sacrifices you (and by default your loved ones) are making to achieve your wishes. And make choices so that you have no regrets later…no matter the outcome.

Incoming gushy post.. 😅 So I'm about to celebrate my 2nd year as an independent and UNCAGED CLINICIAN  and I can't help but feel a huge sense of gratitude. ❤️

I took a completely different approach to freedom and decided to serve blue collar workers in the industrial field. I have been in this field for 5 years now and have had more success than I could have dreamed of. 

Thank goodness for the support of family, friends, other therapists, and sites like this. What a wild, nerve racking, and crazy ride. 💯

Is anyone using red light therapy beds in their practice? 

We’ve had multiple inquires about it recently as there is no one in our geographical area offering it so we’ve star￼ted to research it more. 

What are you marketing it for: pain/inflammation relief, neuropathy, sports recovery, body contouring & weight loss?

What kind of results are your patients/clients achieving with it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a Pelvic Health PT, I use an inter-vaginal red light device to promote increased self-lubrication and decreased pain. This is really important during peri-menopause and while breastfeeding since estrogen levels decrease (this can lead to a lot of dryness in the vaginal canal). Usually topical estrogen creams are the go-to intervention for vaginal dryness, but many of my clients prefer the red light because there is no risk of chemical SE and they like the idea of not using synthetic hormones. My clients are huge fans and see results within a few weeks using red light! 

Other than using red light inter-vaginally, I don’t currently have any panels or beds in my clinic. I personally use a Joov red light panel every morning that I meditate in front of. 

My dad become very curious about red light therapy for athletic recovery after hearing that many collegiate football teams have installed red light rooms in their locker rooms! This was a big selling point for him and he now purchased his own red light panels to use at home. 

Since red light targets the mitochondria of the cells it contacts and increased cellular output/function, it helps to optimize most body systems. Because it can be so broadly used, I would inquire into what exact uses your clients are looking to use it for and perhaps design your marketing around that!

> **Response 2:** I don’t have a bed, but I have several pads that I use. I advertise it for pain control and tissue mobilization at a cellular level. My clients really like it. My mom used a pad for 10 min after having knee pain for weeks and walked away with zero pain, and I did nothing else to her knee.

Does any unicorn in this group know if animal-assisted therapy under the supervision of a physical therapist is a covered service under medicare? From what I’ve read it seems like it’s not but skilled PT is….and it would be a combo of the two. 

If not, how do I go about finding out? 

I’m hoping to start offering private AAT services with my certified pup.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are always a therapist providing therapy with a code appropriate to your treatment. You just happen to use an animal as a mode to deliver it. They stress this in my hippotherapy certification classes.

> **Response 2:** I have a facility dog that works with me in a hospital based outpatient setting.  We bill for whatever we are working on, balance, gait, coordination, etc and consider the animal a tool to work on those things.

Looking for any clinicians who specialize in concussions and/or have online resources! 
.
I was recently introduced to a 30 y/o male who has sustained multiple concussions and is looking for further support. He’s seen multiple concussion docs and hasn’t gotten much help. This past week, he met with the most renowned concussion expert on the east coast and the only advice he recieved was that he should stop all forms of exercise because he’s very tall (🤷🏻‍♀️). 
.
He’s actively searching for a PT who specializes in concussions and offers virtual sessions. He’s interested in a consult to help put some pieces together and treatment as well. Any online resources would also be helpful. 
.
He’s desperately looking for hope. He hasn’t been able to work and used to play on a high level ultimate frisbee team before his first concussion. He wants his life back and wants to find support beyond docs telling him he is fragile.

*Client is located in PA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Chiming in to express my distaste for the recommendation to avoid exercise from the MD. That has to be borderline unethical given what we know about the benefits of exercise.

> **Response 2:** Jess Schwartz!! Concussion corner!!

I’m reading Profit First and was wondering if anyone Is doing this method? What do you think? What bank do you use? I’m using OZK right now for my biz as it is a bit more local. 

I’m also at a cross road because some has advised to open a business credit cards to earn points. But how does that work with the profit first method? 

Thankkkss

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** NOVO banking. All good things 😘 and such a great book

> **Response 2:** I do it to an extent. I don’t have the accounts with a separate bank, but I’m following them for the most part. I do more of what Uncaged Boot Camp recommends.

My local bank was extremely easy and thankful for the business. No fees.

I have a business credit card simply for cash back to save on expenses. I think it is worth it for the free money if you are in top of your finances.

Since I've gone mobile I've been having the same recurring problem, and it's making me want to tear my hear out!  I was hoping you all could share with me if you've found a useful solution...

Why does no one know their wifi passoword?  Young people and old people alike do not know their password.  They sometimes don't even know which network is theirs.  I have tried tethering my hotspot on my phone, but it sometimes won't connect and continuously gets disconnected.  

I feel it's very important for me to give them a valuable and professional looking HEP on day 1, not to mention it's nice to be able to document directly into EMR during sessions, and this problem has kept me from being able to do those things.  I've looked into getting an iPad with a cellular line just to tackle this problem, but it seems expensive and extreme.  Is there an easier way?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am more privacy oriented about this but I wouldn't give my home wi-fi password to ANYONE but my family when here. I think it is inappropriate to ask people for their wifi password.

> **Response 2:** I've never given my wifi password to anyone who comes to work in my home and don't think I would if asked. I use my phone or work offline and then upload when I get home.

Hey group!

Just throwing a line out for some advice. This summer I am leaving my clinic for 6 weeks to join my spouse who is stationed overseas with the military. My supervisor would like me to come up with ways to minimize the financial impact to the clinic. I find it slightly odd for me to come up with ways since we have a team for this, nonetheless I will be compliant. 

Any ideas? 

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is your supervisor coming up with ways to minimize your financial loss from not working for 6 weeks? 

-signed a military spouse who has had enough of employers acting like serving our country is a vacation.

> **Response 2:** This post tells me that Ashley needs to start her own practice.  Based on what you say here, you already are the driver of this one.  It’s just that neither you nor the supervisor see that 😃

Hi everyone, I have been on the sidelines of this group with 
"analysis paralysis" for quite some time. I've had plans to start my own mobile pediatric PT private-pay practice on the side while I have a full time job, and grow slowly to see if it can become something more. Recently, I was at a conference/vendor fair and met a great local referral source who is looking for someone to provide the exact services that I would offer. It lit a fire under me to get things going and fast. My question is-what is the quickest way to get up and running and learn about the basic business side such as compiling a super-bill, covering liability, etc. I'm in SoCal. Thanks for any advice you can offer!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What Justin said, plus I'd recommend a website too. Even if  just a one page Google site for now just to get you going.

> **Response 2:** Other than the great logistical advice here,you might check out Sarah Arnold Hall on IG - she provides coaching services very relevant to getting out of being stuck in planning and systematically executing goals. She had been a huge help for me as a newer business owner! Good luck!

I’m hiring! I’m the owner and founder of The Healing Spot Physical Therapy, a 100% cash-based physical therapy practice in Colorado Springs, CO specializing in women's health PT during pregnancy and postpartum.

I am currently seeking an experienced therapist to join my team at approximately 10 hours per week. There is potential to work up to a full-time position, depending on the success and growth of the role. 

We currently have a 6-8 week wait list for patients who are eager to see us and get started with their care. 

I built my practice to be an environment that I love to work in - 15 minutes between patients for writing notes and no more than 7 patients daily, with full hour-long sessions so that I would have the energy to show up fully for each patient. 

My PT practice is anything BUT a PT Mill and I'm looking for someone to join me who has a passion for working with perinatal women. 

Even if you are not interested in the position,  maybe you know of someone who might be? If you have any leads or recommendations of someone who may be relocating to the area, or who is currently in Colorado Springs but is not satisfied with their employment situation, I would be incredibly grateful if you pass along the information!

Thanks so much for your time and consideration and any help you can offer. Feel free to reach to me with a DM if you have questions! 

Pay and benefits are negotiable.

3 important factors that helped me the most to grow 2 very successful businesses over the past 7 years:
1. Imperfect Action - taking action even when I felt that I didn't have everything perfectly set up. I was led by one leading factor - I have what it takes to help someone significantly, and I'm not going to delay in giving others value because I want to be perfect. 
1. A WHY bigger than myself - Your reason WHY must move beyond yourself. "No one should seek their own good, but the good of others." - 1 Corinthians 10:24 NIV
1. Being humble enough to ask for help. Asking for help and getting mentorship was one of, if not the TOP factor, that helped me to succeed. I would suggest you do the same.

Need recommendations for this patient’s bathroom for them to easily be able to get in and out of shower and not feel like they’re going to slip and fall of the chair while in there. Using a small bench already but doesn’t help and have already tried tub transfer bench; too big doesn’t fit. This patient has advanced MS and is wheelchair bound and no motivation left to shower given the scenario 😞

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My first thought was glass needs to be removed and replaced with a curtain as well.

> **Response 2:** Shower bench with half out of the shower with a backing to the chair. That way he can do a pivot transfer outside the shower then scoot on the bench. Might need to take out the door though?

Is the grass really greener? Is it though, really?
That’s what I wrestle with on a daily basis. I’m currently working full-time in large hospital. It’s standard corporate healthcare, with all of the usual BS. I like my job, though. I get paid relatively well (or so I think). No weekends, no holidays. My patients love me, and I love them. I am a parent of young kids. I value my time more than anything. I like that I don’t have to think about work when I finally come home at night. And yet, I still struggle with the “what if?”… what if I’m missing out on something? Would becoming Uncaged and breaking out on my own make me happier? Would it make me lonelier, not constantly being around coworkers? Would it mess with my mental health? Would it steal my time away from my kids? Does anyone regret going out on their own? I’m sure there are many opinions out there, and maybe this group is inherently biased towards breaking out, but I’m curious and would love honest feedback.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** "I value my time more than anything", is what you wrote. My perspective is this - my business is my 3rd child. The nice thing? I have flexibility over my schedule when the first borns need me. The hard part? The 3rd child always needs attention to! 🙂

> **Response 2:** Based on everything you said - stay where you are. If/when you start hating your job and you want more schedule flexibility and more control of how you treat your patients in order to eventually get paid more to do less, then branch out. But right now…. Stay put my friend! Business is not easy, especially at first. I was lonelier for sure. I’m eager to get back into a team setting at some point, but would only ever join a primary care practice.

So we are almost 2 years into our business. Holy moly what a ride! We are now switching from LLC to S-Corp (we are in Ohio). We are converting our 2 indep contractor PTs to employees. Looking to add front office/admin help. We are in works of expanding our business plan with a God size dream with things outside of the PT realm. 

Does anyone do business consulting where we meet a few times to look at current structure, help get things more streamlined before more growth, make sure we have good systems in place? I don’t know that we want extensive business coaching long term at this point? Basically need help tidying up before growth. The business took off way faster than expected and some unorganized things so I feel we need some more organizing before more growth. Look at insurance, P&P, etc and how to hire essentially. We feel pretty good but always nice for an outside expert to take a look.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congratulations!!! Feeling the same about organization 😩 I met with an IT friend and he said he needed a whole day to re-organize all my drives and clouds and folders 😂

Friends! I need personal PT help! I was running out to the front yard this evening and while taking a step felt and heard a snap in my L gastroc muscle belly. Immediate pain and I couldn’t put weight on my foot. It’s not my Achilles. Currently I’ve been icing and elevating, have a compression sock on my lower leg, and have taken Motrin and Tylenol. I have significant pain if I try any DF with knee extension, and I’m able to DF some but not to neutral with my knee flexed to 90 with gravity eliminated. I don’t see any bruising and my calf is VERY tender to touch. 

Obviously I tore my gastroc, but does anyone have helpful tips? I already ordered a CAM boot that will get here in 2 days, and I have red light, cups, ice, a pretty crappy US machine, and rock tape. Anyone else want to throw an idea at me to make this miraculously better?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like might be plantaris tendon rupture. 

MICE. Movement.ice.compression.elevation. Just be aware of compartment syndrome very unlikely but good to keep an eye on it. 

This will get better and good luck!!!🍀💪

> **Response 2:** I had this exact thing last year. I’d limit anti-inflammatories unless the swelling gets out of control. Let the healing process happen. 

I used BFR, sleep, and walking as much was tolerated. Slowly added stairs.

I tried some KT tape to just assist with that hug everyone loves, but it was really only helpful for 1-2 days when acute.

**Original Post:**
AI Receptionist. So I had an interesting demo this week.

Background: I got a part time receptionist who is horrible answering calls/talking to people etc. afraid of what else is out there with my limited income, I started looking for VAs. Came into a facebook ad for virtual AI receptionist and filled form for info (was curious). 

About 5 min later I got a call from the company. Hayle spoke to me, answered questions, scheduled a demo. I get a text confirming, an email with zoom and a PS: hayle was an ai not human. I could never tell. 

I was super excited for my demo yesterday. They build you a full system. Your receptionist answers calls, questions, emails, texts. They teach her everything. They integrate with chat gpt.. it schedules appointments, reschedules, call, email or text patients after sessions to follow up how they are doing, sends intakes, call each lead about 5 min after they click your ad (apparently anything less than 4 min is considered creepy by people 🤷🏻‍♀️)…. Call patients who canceled and not returned within few weeks to check what is up… the only thing it doesn’t do is check insurance verification. If they realize patient is very upset, situation is critical and require a human, they say it will have doctor call you back after next appointment. It even takes payments and leave credit card on file…

I was all in until cost: $7500 set up fee + 0.2 a min call (email and texts are free). Well to br fair after i had a heart attack with price and hang up they did text offering $5k if i paid in 1 payment. 

I don’t worry that much of the 0.2 min call… because my volume is low. But set up not being sure it will work is scary…

Thoughts? Any experiences?

Ps: for an extra tour Va can have your own personal voice and be “you”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a consumer, AI gives me the ick. Knowing who is answering and seeing them when you get there is special. Hunt you down a a good human and lay expectations hard before they start. We are on our third receptionist in 5 years (none got fired, just moved away) but our girl now is amazing!! I think we just got better at voicing our expectations.

> **Response 2:** What is the name of the company

Has anyone ever treated or worked with someone with Slipping Rib Syndrome? I have a new client coming in tomorrow who is desperate for help, and I’ve never even heard of this disorder before. I’ve done some research tonight and it looks like core stabilization and general trunk and upper body isometrics will probably be best, but I’d love some tricks of the trade of anyone has some.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I treated someone post surgical for slipped rib recently. They were given very poor guidance from the surgeon as this is a very rare occurrence in our area but she did well once her surgical pain was managed. She was very debilitated and needed to work on  endurance, core and postural exercises.

> **Response 2:** Recently had an older patient with 12th rib slipping, very painful to walk but sitting was fine. Her husband is a retired physician and they did a lot of research and didn’t find much. She gets some relief from TENS and regular injections. Unfortunately nothing else seemed to help.

Can someone tell doctors, assisted livings, nurses, etc that Fox rehab isn’t the only home therapy company in the world?! Anyone notice that this is the only company that patients get referred to?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There is McDonalds... and everyone else. 
There is Starbucks... and everyone else. 

Fox has spent lots of money establishing themselves as the Kleenex of physical therapy. Nobody says "Grab me a fascial tissue." They say grab me a Kleenex. 

So since Fox owns the general home physical therapy space, you can build a presence in the specialty space. You can be the post surgical knee guy or the skin breakdown guy or the ??? guy.

Just go one layer down.

> **Response 2:** Weighing in after watching this for a while. To compete with Fox you have to be different than Fox, but also don’t be afraid to collaborate with Fox. What can you do to build up your reputation to be ‘the best’ option? Quality therapy? Specialty programs? Better/more direct customer service? Market as a locally owned business? Make the most of your smaller scale - get to know the providers and local home health agencies so they know YOU and trust you are the best option for their patients. And reach out to your local fox manager to let them know you can help if there are regions they can’t provide therapy in. I know my local fox regional directors and often refer back and forth if/when we can’t accommodate someone due to waitlist or territory and they do the same for us. We often have patients seeing a Fox PT and a Healthy Aging Physical Therapy OT etc. make friends ..not enemies :)

I'm not sure what to do....one of my contractors went into labor early and lost the baby. What is something I can do for her? (besides giving her unlimited leave) Just something to say I'm sorry and I care. I just can't imagine the pain she must be feeling.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a loss mom-I can give you one piece of advice: LISTEN to her, give her her feelings back.  Please do NOT say 
1) God needed an angel
2) It will get better in time
3) God has a plan
4) God only gives us what we can handle
5) I know how you’re feeling 
Instead, here’s what you CAN say
1) “What can I do?”
2) I don’t know what to say
And I can tell you-send her a grocery list of paper towels, toilet paper, paper plates, napkins, & food. 
I am SO sorry that she is going through this. This is the WORST possible pain any mother can go through.

> **Response 2:** I want to say thank you for changing the perspective and giving her your support. I been in the corporate PT where they didn't care of your loss and bombard about getting notes done and just not being supportive during the process. She will be very appreciative of just knowing you are there to help her. 

This is the type of boss I imagine myself being to not just think financially but also treating my employees like family and giving them time to grieve as needed.

**Success happens over nights - not overnight**

It is so easy to get bummed out or to feel like a failure when we see others doing great things in their practices.

Two things:

👉 I am willing to bet that when you see those wins, the intention is meant to motivate and inspire you.

👉 The subliminal message in those posts is: "*After a good period of busting my butt, being obedient to the process, and trusting the process, this has been the outcome... and you can do this, too!"*

You know those new music artists that suddenly bust onto the scene? They've actually been working on their craft for years. 

Those public speakers who captivate an audience? They have logged hours honing that skill.

An athlete who can perform a particular move with ease and grace has put in thousands upon thousands of reps to master it.

Clinic owners who are "crushing it" have gone through their own frustrations of rejections.

If you are struggling, then ask: How are you struggling?  Where is the block?

In our experience, it is one of three things:

👉 Their Identity has not been defined

👉 They struggle with conversations (due to #1)

👉 All of the above

"Overnight" success is achieved when we enjoy the journey to getting there.

Keep taking steps.

The UNCAGED team and myself are cheering for you.

If you want to chat, I'm here for you.

Okay, so, real talk. I'm feeling defeated, desperate and overwhelmed with the therapy world and really want to dive into this thing - but I'm terrified.

I am currently 26 weeks pregnant and my husband was recently traumatically injured in a work accident on 4/26/23 where he will be off work for an extended time (he lost 2 fingers and will need multiple surgeries for his two remaining).

In your opinion, is this feasible given my circumstances to dive in now? Or, would you wait until after baby is here? Just needing some real life advice I guess. I know there are many contingencies.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m sorry to hear of your husband’s accident. Maybe this is not the time to dive into a new project or make big changes or decisions, take care of yourself and your baby, help your husband and revisit the concept of job or career changes after you recover from childbirth

> **Response 2:** No question for me, wait! Get settled in new baby world, let someone pay some maternity leave as you set up your business. Also, don't let crazy pregnancy hormones rule your decisions or how you interact with your new clients. What if you go 10 weeks early? What would you do, you aren't set up, etc. Get excited and planned...that's my real world advice. Life will be challenging for the next few months, after that, dive in. While there's no perfect time, this doesn't seem like anywhere close to the right time based on the info you provided.

What tips do you have for staying positive after you get a string of calls who all immediately ask about insurance then want to check with insurance before booking?

I'm doing fine in my biz so I know I shouldn't take it personally, but man I get so tired of having to explain insurance over the phone and then having people not book when I know I can help them!

I know this is the bane of every cash-based provider's existence so just looking for a little solidarity and tips on staying positive! Thanks friends!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I usually start off with a “tell me what’s going on” intro.  if they are really focused on me answering that question first I will tell them that “I am not in network with any insurance is followed by but tell me what’s going on.”  I try to get them talking about their problem to create some investment on both of our parts.  The conversation at least goes a lot smoother versus just ending with a no. At the very least the person has told me their story and they know that I’m interested in seeing them. No one likes to tap to tell their story twice so it gives me an advantage.

> **Response 2:** “Do you want to work with your insurance, or do you want to work with me?” If they were a warm lead from a recommendation that tends to help. Also my google reviews are good so I’ll point out the difference between my reviews and others. If they are set on using their insurance then I flip right into a mode of being very helpful about where to go (you usually know the good clinics or clinicians in town). At least then I’ve won them over down the road if they don’t like the in network experience. It’s that mindset shift that stops me from getting bummed out

I also set a reminder to call back in a few days. I’ve gotten someone that way because the in network places were talking deductible and they read some reviews. Oh and they could t get an appointment for 3 weeks. Fortune is in the follow up

**Original Post:**
If your a therapist, You MUST read  this book & read this chapter first (in the pic) to see the profound correlations￼ between ethical fading in all areas of business and the REHAB world. 

I will share public on my personal business page if you want to share! 

I summarized the chapter below putting all my (therapy correlations in parentheses)

CHAPTER 8: Ethical fading:￼ When structure replaces leadership

-the infinite game means to run a business with no end goal, just help advance humanity and help people. 
-The finite game means to run a business always looking to win, reach a goal, quota, number, productivity percentage￼
-if ethical fading can happen where integrity is taken really seriously, like the military, then it can happen anywhere! And it does! 
-if you Create processes, check boxes, quotas or productivity percentages to be reached, they will always will tell us what we want to hear, but it may not be telling us the truth
-when leaders choose to implement processes and demands (like productivity rather than clinical judgment), The opportunity for systemic ethical fading persist, especially if these demands are not only unreasonable but are OUTRIGHT impossible. 
-pressure comes from the top down (director of rehab telling you what to do) but also pressure comes from the bottom up (in an effort to stand out, new grads/those looking for a raise/brown nosers want to appear they can do everything, so they work off the clock or provide fraudulent therapy to reach productivity) and a failure to do these bad things makes others look bad. Submitting a false report helps the system run smoothly and keeps their careers on track. Because the punishment for being honest is greater than for Lies, (therapist) feel they have to lie or cheat to meet the requirements placed upon them. It’s a catch 22. They will do this while believing that their high moral standards have remained uncompromised. They don’t see this as unethical or lying, they see it as part of the bureaucratic process of checking the boxes, just doing what leader ship wanted them to do. 
-When these seemingly minor transgressions become pervasive in a culture, it is a sign of ethical fading!
-the irony is that when we apply finite related solutions to address a problem of ethical fading, that finite minded thinking created, we get more ethical fading. When we use processes and structure to fix cultural problems, we get more lying and cheating, then the behavior becomes normalized. 
-calling someone a lazy leader is not calling them a bad person just like calling someone a lazy person who doesn’t want to exercise doesn’t mean they’re a bad person. Their decisions are often very well intended. They actually believe these demands are going to be helpful but because leadership never experiences these demands they’re oblivious to the problems they create. 
-More structure is not the answer! 
-ethical fading  is a People problem and we need PEOPLE to correct a People problem
-THE ANSWER is an infinite mind set
-leaders who give their staff a just cause to advance, and give them a trusting TEAM, Will build a culture in which their people can work toward the STG while staying ethical, NOT because they are told to, NOT because they have a checklist that requires it, NOT because they took the companies online course, they did it because it’s the natural human thing to do. 
-my input…
-leadership should let their SNF therapists know that if they let their productivity dip below 90% because it was ethically correct to take time to talk to a family member or doctor which is non-productive time, the company may not have enough money to support raises or other employee request this year but if they also support the just cause of “ let’s help our seniors age in place and keep them as mobile and healthy as we possibly can” by selling more 1:1 gym training or wellness programs, we can fund more employee request! Now if your higher ups and COEs are making millions or billions, THATS A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is 💯💯💯 . I love Simon Sinek

> **Response 2:** I’m starting to wonder if people are ignoring their ￼ moral compass

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 🙋‍♀️ you are going to get a lot of really great advice from a therapy perspective and a therapy business perspective on this page. I also work with a SCORE mentor (it's a free program across the country that links you up with someone in your city who can mentor you for starting a small business). I have found it really helpful for non-therapy, but state specific stuff. They will help you write a business plan, they will look at your books to help you figure out where to be more profitable. They will teach you where free resources are (like market analyses on the local library website). Mine happened to have mentored another OT in the past, so I was able to connect with others to network. It's been very beneficial along with the great support from the mentors here!

> **Response 2:** Me!  Been on my own for two years now and I haven’t regretted one second of it. I say use groups like this to get ideas but make sure you do your own research as well. Some well meaning people may give wrong info or things that maybe only pertain to their state etc…
Good luck!

Apologies in advance for the long post but I need some advice/guidance…

I am a PTA that left my private practice job to go out on my own. I’m working the “grey” areas by getting my personal training certification and using my background in PT to market more experience and to more of the clientele that I’m used to, such as balance/neuro/general strengthening etc. My clients are ones that were unable to continue PT due to insurance or being d/c due to lack of progress, but all with hx of progressive diseases.

My question is, I’m doing documentation as I normally would but with different wording as a CPT, I’m keeping track of mileage, receipts, checks, and making initial agreement forms. I have a waiver and liability form but I have no idea if it’s written the way I need it to. I’m not sure if I have too much or too little as far as covering for taxes and getting everything together. I don’t have an account (too new, not enough income) and I do my taxes through turbo tax mostly. Do I have everything? Is there a certain way to do some of this so it’s easier?  It feels a bit overwhelming starting your own business and I’m not sure if I have everything I need in place.

Feel free to send me a message if that’s easier. Thanks in advance everyone!

> **Response 1:** Let me say this, don't get hung up on your PTA license, because you can't legally practice PT without a PT setting a POC right? As long as you aren't caliming to be offering PT services, legally you are fine. At least where I live, you are now providing wellness services.
You cannot turn the PTA knowledge part of your brain off, use it to help your clients. You can market your years experience in the field, that's perfectly fine, its true information. You can't offer PT services, that is true. The services you'll be offering will be wellness. Wellness is a huge umbrella that you can work under. Stay licensed!
I have a PTA friend (still maintains her license) that went out on her own and offered STOTT pilates (she is certified)...she now has 2 studios and several employees. She can't not use her PTA knowledge when addressing issues for her clients. She uses it all the time. Legally she isn't providing PT. 
Also, I think you should document as you see fit for helping your clients, and keep track of your expenses and mileage like a normal business of any kind. 
That's my take on things for what it's worth.
Good luck on your new journey!😊

> **Response 2:** Here is a thought if you are growth minded.  Find a PT that may also have mutual interests in the areas you are trying to impact ( patient type, niche,etc….) and function as a PTA along with wellness types of services that you offer. It may sound overwhelming but it sounds like you’re already doing some heavy lifting in your current business endeavor.  Nothing big to start, maybe a PT that is looking for a side hustle. You may be surprised how appealing your business sounds to a PT that may be looking for more flexibility of schedule , smaller scale and functioning outside the more traditional models out there.  I know this does not address your questions in regards to needs of operations but just a thought.

**Original Post:**
For those who have started their own mobile and/or cash based business. Do you feel that there is a need for years of experience before doing so or is it more about just doing it?

Sometimes I feel that if I am going to charge cash rates that I need to have a couple of extra skills like dry needling and/or manipulations so that I provide more than just the average PT.

Or is it just providing that amazing customer service. What really is the thing?…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I remember a therapist telling me exactly this. “Work for 5 years. Develop your skills and make connections. Then go on your own.”

Total BS. 

You can hire experience instead of waiting to gain it. 

In a cash model people aren’t buying the commodity of PT. They are buying “The Experience” not YOUR experience. 

Every year you spend not doing things that move you toward your goal is a year driving in the wrong direction.

> **Response 2:** This is a great question 🙂 and I’m going to say what I think you need to hear, maybe not what you want to hear. 

I’ve got 3 thoughts that I think will be helpful:

Most people will consider clinical skill, personal growth and finances, so let’s tackle them. 

1.  You need clinical mentorship, always. In a busy clinic sometimes you can’t actually get that anyway….sometimes you can.

Just be honest about what you specialize in. 

The problem comes when I see someone say “I’m a chronic pain specialist “ or “I’m the ankle guy” 

When they haven’t taken any CEUs in that content. 

There is a difference between interest and mastery.

With that said, I have 3 clinical mentors, 2 business mentors and my own business with a speciality in pelvic floor concerns and sexual wellness. I also offer mentorship in this arena. 

With either option, make your circle full of people that inspire you, it’s worth every penny. 

My meetings with my clinical mentors are by far my favorite day of the week. 

Truly understanding your clients and knowing how to help them is wayyy more valuable than any manipulation or dry needling course.

People buy from you because you can give them a result, that’s the important stuff. 

👏👏Again because this topic gets me fired up: People invest thousands of dollars and their time in life altering results , not any single modality. That’s where our gold is. 🙂

Your question made me pause because this ☝️is really important for everyone 🙂

I can sum up all my advice in that one sentence and will forever stand by it. 

Being able to say “I love helping this person get this result and I’m really fucking good at it” is a prerequisite to be successful  imo. I’m curious, do you feel this way about a specific population? 

If you’re choosing between a first year job that offers clinical mentorship with someone you admire and your own business, I’d choose the mentorship. 

If you’re choosing a shitty factory job and your own business, I’d choose your business. 

2. The other problem here is if you don’t  know who you are clinically yet. 

Some people finish school thinking “I love acute care” and end up working in and loving pediatrics. 

It’s never a rush and I think giving yourself time to explore and try many jobs for a few years can be helpful if you aren’t sure about who your ideal client is. 

The beauty of having your own business is being able to help the people that you best serve and enjoy helping. 

I think it’s helpful to have an idea of who that is first and jumping around in this way is harder as a business owner. 

It’s helpful for you so that you love your business and life in the future. 🙂 

3. Financial. 

Let’s not discredit this elephant in the room. My first few years working for someone else, I was miserable, thought about quitting daily and made $30-$35 an hour. 

Now I’m a business of 1, today I have 4 dream clients and I make $20-30k a month. Hearing those numbers, sounds super tempting especially if you owe massive amounts of student debt, as I did. 

My advice here is that, if you already know you are entrepreneurial. You will be successful and you will earn that income. It’s a matter of timing. 

It will happen, so it doesn’t have to happen today. Someone that says it does, might be trying to sell you something 🙂 

Starting a business is a huge emotional investment, at least it has been for me. You will suprise yourself and be so much more successful than you ever dreamed. Give yourself the gift of the process. 

It’s a lot more fun when you have an idea of who you are clinically, what you LOVE to do and support in place. 

It will happen, so it doesn’t have to happen yesterday.  🙂

Hope this helps

I am solo PT.
 Please advise on how to respond to negative Google review.  I had discharged this patient 6 months ago and recently she texted me on my work Google voice number asking if it is possible to recover from myofascial pain syndrome. I did not reply. Now she wrote a one star Google review stating that "doesn't answer questions after session ". She also wrote name of another  PT in the area, stating  people should go to this other PT instead. How should I respond? Can I report this review to Google? Can I reply to her review and say that I had not seen her in 6 months? Will I be violating HIPPA by responding and saying I haven't seen her in 6 months?

Please advise.  Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Per chatGPT, Here are a few professional and HIPAA-compliant responses you can use to address the negative review while maintaining your integrity and reputation:

Example 1: Emphasizing Commitment to Patient Care

 “We are committed to providing the highest level of care to all our patients, and we take feedback seriously. Due to privacy regulations, we cannot discuss specific details about anyone’s care in this forum. If you’d like to discuss your concerns further, please reach out to us directly at [your contact info]. Wishing you the best on your health journey.”

Example 2: Redirecting to Professional Channels

 “Thank you for your feedback. We strive to maintain clear and timely communication with all of our patients during their treatment. However, once treatment is concluded, follow-up questions may require scheduling a consultation for a thorough response. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly at [your contact info] for assistance. Wishing you continued success in reaching your health goals.”

Example 3: Addressing the Mention of a Competitor

 “We appreciate you sharing your experience. At [Business Name], our goal is to support patients throughout their recovery journey with personalized care. For privacy reasons, we cannot discuss specifics of any case here, but we encourage you to contact us directly to address your concerns. We wish you the best in finding the care that suits your needs.”

Tips for All Responses:
 • Avoid engaging in a debate or appearing defensive.
 • Keep the tone positive and professional, focusing on resolution and respect.
 • Always provide a way for the patient to contact you offline, showing openness to resolution without breaching privacy laws.

These responses help maintain your credibility while demonstrating your dedication to patient care and professionalism.

Patient fell on ice, with possible rib fracture, male 40yo. No xray.

Going to start with breathwork and education on bracing using pillow.

While we cant fix a broken rib, what other treatments and education can help with pain management and facilitating healing? Should anything be avoided besides mobilizing the effected rib?
TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** i worked with an MVA multiple rib fx and he felt better with taping especially when transfering and with bed mobility; also IDK why but he felt very relaxed and much pain releif with BLE heels on wall on his back (facing the headboard of the bed); he used it after he was sitting up for a while (he was a musician). Once he was able to contract lower abdominals painfree and do basic lumbar stabilization his lower ribs healed faster than the middle ones; we avoided rotation until it was painfree.

> **Response 2:** I would not choose to treat unless there was an X ray performed, especially if this is an initial evaluation and acute.

Deep breathing with an acute rib fracture is going to be very uncomfortable. You can teach avoiding valsalva with movements to decrease the pressure and advise on supporting his arm and avoiding overhead reaching. The advice I would give varies a little depending on which ribs you suspect involvement with.

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

I would recommend checking with city hall or any city councel members to make sure there aren’t additional permits or licenses needed prior to “opening your doors” to the public. You may also need to check with the City Fire Marshall to make sure you don’t need any fire extinguishers in your space or if what the fitness center has will suffice. Good luck to you and congratulations!❤️

Enlighten me….20 sessions in 2 months … gets a second opinion from me without me KNOWING before eval he was seeing someone (I saw 20
Of 60 used checking his insurance but didn’t know what he used them for)… could someone really have missed the mark for that long 🫣😵‍💫🤯. Who keeps treating a forearm with these findings ?????
Note to MD: As part of this physical therapy evaluation, the patient presents with sudden-onset left forearm pain and grip weakness, not consistent with a localized mechanical or neurological injury. Given the patient’s history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the absence of clear orthopedic findings, I am concerned this presentation may reflect a systemic process, such as:
·Lupus-associated inflammatory myopathy
·Vasculitis affecting local perfusion
·Early signs of cardiac involvement (e.g., myocarditis or pericarditis)
The patient demonstrated disproportionate fatigue and reduced grip endurance with mild exertion during therapy, with no signs of paresthesia, cervical involvement, or peripheral nerve entrapment.
Recommendation:
I recommend medical follow-up for further evaluation, including potential lab work (CK, ESR, CRP, ANA subsets) and/or cardiac workup if clinically indicated.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I will continue to monitor the patient’s status in therapy.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is a very difficult post to understand. What are you actually asking?

> **Response 2:** Have you not ruled out peripheral nerve entrapment? I’d go there before MI. He’s a mechanic. But not enough history is provided here to determine which one based on what’s provided. What are you asking? Why not consult the other medical professional vs blasting them on an online forum?

When you go beyond what most people are willing to do, you reap the rewards!! 

(One job I didn’t get had a jersey hanging on the wall with my last name on it and 3 very excited-looking sports PT guys at the table.  I had no idea who the player was and at that moment I knew I’d blown it. 😆)

Hi everybody!  I am a cash-based practice and I provide superbills and help people with the insurance process to try to help them get reimbursed.  I am getting super overwhelmed though and don't have time to spend hours on the phone doing this and am looking to hire somebody who can help me with it.  What type of professional/position is it that I need to hire?  I don't know where to start!  Thanks all!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Didn’t you start a cash practice so you didn’t have to do this?

> **Response 2:** Your clients should be figuring out how to submit them! You just provide the superbill and the client takes it from there. I chose that model for my practice so I never have to talk to another insurance company again.

For everyone who's an Amazon associate!! This updated Mar 1, 24 and I just verified with Amazon. You are now officially able to text, email, and msg associate links! This is a huge game changer and makes it soooo much easier to get your patients the products they need without having to add it to your sight, LTK, of post it on social. I've been with them 13 years and it's about time they changed this 🙄
Just be careful with text still, I'm seeing some say especially for new accts, they'll still shut you down (just open a new one if it happens). Social msging is best msging option so they can still track it. 
Here's the new tos from Amazon:

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I texted these links and my account was denied. They closed it since they couldn't find tracker id. I'd. I guess you can DM these links through your IG or FB but not via phone sms.

***I received consent to post. R ant delt atrophy compared to L 

Hello uncaged clinicians! I’m treating an elite powerlifter. Has anyone ever seen something like this?  He was told by his doctor that his ant delt n (axillary n?) would never work the same again s/p RTC repair (yrs ago).. He trains bodybuilders so I know he has tried training his delt in all shapes and forms, but this atrophy impacts his barbell chest press numbers. Any insights? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have, could be multifactorial.

Is the nerve issue due to the MOI or is it iatrogenic from surgery?

agree EMG/NCV would be beneficial 

Regardless need to assess the radial nerve mobility and clean up any impaired issues.  

Capsular mobility?

Also, what’s his pectoral mobility like?  Needs to have close to 65degrees of horizontal abduction at 90 degrees abducted otherwise may contribute  to continues reciprocal inhibition patterns. 

If interested I’d be happy to FaceTime or zoom to talk further and even reassess so I can see his clinical presentation.

> **Response 2:** Bill Johnson, I feel like you just treated someone with nearly the same condition with massive success

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If it is the Amazon Associate program it might just be that your site is too small. Not enough content, articles, pages. 

If it is the Amazon Influencer Program it is that you don’t have enough subscribers/followers and not enough engagement. 

Either way, keep working on growing your presence and keep applying. There is not penalty to applying again. You will get there.

For anyone that’s asked me about Aflac policies…. I have these 4. As you can see I’m not losing $$. Dependents do not cost extra. Between simple annual physicals … to a sprained ankle… a 3rd degree curling iron burn 😵‍💫😭🫣 they have no weaseled their way out of any of the claims. I think reps are state dependent but I’m here to tell you it’s not a scam. The only one I haven’t used thank God is the cancer / stroke/ amputation policy. You would have to call Aflac to find a rep I have no connections / affiliations.

I just finished talking to Captain David Bayliff . Asking how I was doing etc etc etc .. don't you just love people checking on you? People genuinely ask how are you doing? Without his weekly reminders that I am awesome and that I will do great. I wouldn't be able to do what I am doing. 

You have to have people like that. People who will plant seed of greatness. People who will encourage you. People who wants you to win. People who will bring out the best in you. Not the worst in you. 

Captain D thanks for all the encouragement and mentoring you provide. Not just for me. But as well as the rest of the UNCAGED CLINICIAN !!!

Happy PT month from GeriHab Physical Therapy and Wellness !!!

Yup, that's our GeriHab Jackson location. I would like to insert the rest of the team, but I don't know how to do that. Lol.

I am currently a solo mobile OT, I take Medicare and OON with everyone else. I am looking for advice. I’m currently full with a 2-3 person waitlist.
I’m in Florida so it’s very seasonal. During season I was slammed. Treating like 10-12 hours a day.
I said I’m not doing that again next season. Well season is over, and it really has not slowed down. I know it’s a good problem to have.
However, I need to have time to do the business and marketing. I have a girl who helps me with front desk tasks and a billing team for submissions. So that takes some load off.
I enjoy going to marketing events and building relationships but I’m really burning myself out.
I’ve went the hiring route and that has been really hard. 
I’m willing to scale because I just feel like I’m burning out and hitting a ceiling.
My front desk girl is helping to market which is great but also there is limited space.
There’s more I can talk about but that’s the general gist.
I’m thinking either I go cash based, or create a concierge package they must buy in to…
Any other tips would be great thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You didn’t ask a direct question other than tips. And really this is personal. I say this because my wife and I both PTs do mobile as well. I want to see more to make more and can deal with it. She needs more of a break and a healthier balance. 

I say that because you should take a minute or a weekend and write out what you want your life to look like. Your biz and practice should serve as an extension of you to provide you with that life, not take it over. 

From there, a lot of what you’re saying will work itself out. I’m not saying it will be easy but you should have a closer idea of where you are taking your practice. 

For example, we don’t see ourselves getting a space. We like the flexibility. As much as I’d love one, it doesn’t serve our life and goals. So we won’t. And every time I get the desire to get one, we always reference our goals. 

Have your goal, then work backwards. There’s lots of options to stay mobile though. You can hire, you can raise prices, set limits on number of Medicare clients, etc.

> **Response 2:** So, my opinion is that the point of being mobile and working for yourself is that you get to control your time. If you feel you’re burning out, cut back. There are a couple ways to do that: hire, stop accepting patients, discharge people, change the type of patients you accept, or raise your prices. You can do any combo of this, but my opinion is that your most lucrative option while also cutting back on hours would be accepting only cash (so commercial insurance based) clients. You can provide superbill a on request, but you have complete control over what you bill, and therefore will be able to see fewer people and still probably get close to what you were making. And most importantly, you’ll burn out less.

Does anyone here have PTAs working for them? How do you talk to your clients so that they don’t think they are getting lesser quality care from a PTA vs. a DPT?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you think that?  I employ PTAs and OTAs and have never thought that.  So I would first ask yourself, how do you see them? What makes it lesser quality care?  To be honest, most PTs are so caught up in evals and paperwork, they have little time for treatment.  On the other hand,, assistants only treat, all day long.  They are experts.  But it doesn't matter what anyone here thinks, it's what you think.  If you have any biases, then you won't be able to convince anyone otherwise.

> **Response 2:** I used to manage several PTAs before opening my practice and if you spend the time to teach and train them they can be very good and provide super high quality care. If you can pair that with a good personality the patients may even request them over you. Just like we were taught, they can be taught too.

Hi there! I currently have a cash based mobile PT practice seeing orthopedic patients. I’m also TPI (titleist performance institute) certified but do not see a lot of golfers yet. I have an opportunity to have space at a local
up and coming high end golf club. They want to be able to offer PT/TPI screens to their members. I would be an independent contractor and could bring in my own private clients to treat and use the space as well. No rent but will take a % of each visit. 

In my area, no other golf clubs offer anything like this so I have no reference. Does anyone work in a similar set up? Any words of advice, questions I should ask, or things I should look out for? I’m meeting them next week to discuss details. 

Thanks in advance for your input! This group has been amazing and helped me tremendously along this journey!

Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BNI has a pretty good return for cash pay. Find a bigger group if you can. OON providers rely on that org to get started pretty heavily in my area because other members are incentivized to send to you

For real though. Ask your clients (who are doing well and love you) if they know anyone else who could benefit from your help the same way they have.

Super interested in this option but wondering how it would change my practice.

Thank you for your knowledge and experience!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Finishing this march. I love it. I learned a lot. Makes me understand chronic fatigue syndrome, cramps, inflammation, hormonal, aging and lots and lots more. I did mine though via FBS functional
Nutrition alliance. They cover whole body system.

> **Response 2:** I just finished the first course for IFM, AFMCP. Starting a program in my practice for a 12 week membership. The program will be for people with joint/muscle pain. 4 week guided elimination diet, 4 week reintroduction phase, 4 week maintenance phase. 2 in person PT sessions / month with app basic exercise and mobility program on trainerize. I also have a bachelors in nutrition so incorporating nutrition and PT made sense to me. I’m networking with a functional medicine NP to refer if blood work seems necessary

Hello guys! How do you respond to a “clingy” patient? Clingy (not suree if this is correct word) in a sense that she expects me to remember her birthday (she was already discharged when she celebrated her birthday) and expects to give her flowers or gifts for Mother’s Day. She is currently in my case load. She commented that her housekeeper gave her a beautiful bouquet of flowers for Mother’s Day. I just said, that’s so thoughtful of her! 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Clearly there was a lack of boundaries or this person has unrealistic expectations of a professional relationship.

> **Response 2:** Yeah boundary issue on her part. It happens. Just don’t feed into any of those totally inappropriate expectations If that’s an issue for her, she will deselect. Sounds like you responded correctly.

When you own your own business as an Occupational Therapist you get to treat at the top of your license-no pressure from a big corporation pressuring me to see more patients - you get to take your time and actually see that patient and write goals like this: 

Patient will collaborate with the OT to create a personalized vision board that identifies meaningful short- and long-term life goals, routines, and sources of motivation to support ongoing recovery.

Rationale: Vision board development facilitates self-reflection, motivation, and executive functioning, activating cognitive and emotional processes related to goal setting, habit formation, and occupational engagement. It supports intrinsic motivation for health behavior change and aligns rehabilitation goals with personal values.

Ownership/employee (wear all the hats) : Overwhelm this morning! It’s a beast. Always reaching a new level and new level of fatigue. Any advice? 😅 Will it get any easier with hiring? Does the minimum time available after work for “living” expand at some point?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m going to go LIVE shortly on this. I’ll tag you, Alyssa Nichole Bryant!

> **Response 2:** It does get easier with hiring and once you’re “doing” more and “learning” less! It takes a lot of time to learn everything and put it into practice. My advice is to take all the admin time you need. Take classes if that will help you (it did for me). 

I have also found the balance is what you have to strive to create. Dedicate the # of patient care hours you are comfortable with, same for admin time, and same for family time. 

Calculate your hourly break even point and how many patient visits you need to meet your goals. 

You’ve got this! The best part is you are in control! Do what you need to to find and create a good work life balance!

I got a beautiful gift from my mom for Christmas. She doesn't listen to the Uncaged Clinician podcast, so she had no idea HOW significant this was to me.

One of my absolute favorite episodes is called Anchoring to Your Purpose. Around the 7:40 mark, Kevin DeGroot shares an analogy of the uphill climb on a bicycle, comparing that feeling to business ownership and pointing out why it's not the same at all.

There is no coasting downhill for us. Leaders are *always* climbing.

If you are incapable of looking around you and enjoying/appreciating that climb, then maybe what you're actually doing is chasing.

Chasing a certain account balance. Recognition. Spousal approval. Self validation.

If you're chasing, consider what it might be like to not need to chase anymore.

If you're climbing, keep climbing.

Shout out to Nate Navas for keeping this podcast going for the past 4 years, effectively creating a library of invaluable content.

What should I do if I discover that the clinic owner, who is not a clinician, has been using my electronic signature to sign off on PTA notes while I was out of the country? I am located in Texas and would appreciate any recommendations or insights from anyone who has faced a similar situation. Should I seek legal advice, and are there any specific attorneys I can contact for assistance? Additionally, does the Texas Physical Therapy Association or APTA offer support or resources for addressing this type of issue?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a similar situation, I documented everything very very well, talked with a lawyer who sent a desist letter,  and immediately resigned to show good faith.  Maybe it was over the top but I was so pissed I didn’t care.  If anything, send all correspondence in email so there’s a paper trail

> **Response 2:** I would contact your professional liability insurance carrier as they should cover this and will have lawyers they want you to use. For anyone else reading, this is a good reason to have your own coverage, even if your company provides coverage as you are in control.

Assuming these are on federal payers as well (MC, TC etc) you could have a Qui Tam claim which once investigated can give you up to 15-30% of the total they recover from fraudulent claims (also there is retaliation protection). They would not just look at these false claims, but others across the clinic which could total goodness knows how much….

Hello everyone my name is Aiyinde Abraham I am a 3-year PT student in Alabama. I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this group. I am strongly considering starting a mobile-based practice after I graduate and I would like to offer my services in rural areas. Any suggestions or advice on what I should be doing to prepare myself to start my own practice? Or are there any suggestions on what I could and possibly should do to put myself in the best financial position as an upcoming new grad?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Commend your confidence but strongly recommend spending a year or 2 getting experience working side by side with experienced PTs. You learn a lot in school, however the real education happens when you start working.

> **Response 2:** I commend you for your vision and having the guts to start your own practice. Get as much experience as possible to determine where your niche or calling is. When you’re passionate about what you do, it really makes you focus on the goal and purpose. Learn from mentors on the ins & outs of private practice. Market to family and friends first. Then let them spread the word to their friends.

Odd question but here it goes.. so I am expecting my first baby this upcoming winter and I have started to tell my patients, some of which I have been with for years. I am a niche clinician specializing in breathing as it relates to motor pattern and postural dysfunction so a lot of my patients really rely on me, all of which I’m happy to serve. However, the news of my new mom status has not gone well with some patients, some even unwilling to receive the idea that I will not be seeing patients even before my delivery and of course for a few months after - my business, my rules. I have found other providers who I know and trust and are willing to collaborate to take on these patients but the patients refuse seeing anyone else. Honestly, it’s frustrating to say the least. I’m not sure what else I can do for them but it’s putting a damper on all this new exciting time for me. Any advice or thoughts on how to navigate?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** While I know you are wanting to do the best for your patients, your responsibility to them is only to give them adequate notice and try to assist them in finding other service while you are out on maternity leave and it sounds like you’ve done that.  It is ultimately their decision and their choice if the go with someone else, or take a break from PT.  If anyone is expecting you to not take time off for the birth of your baby and to recover afterward they are being selfish and honestly you’re probably better off without them.  You will build your business back up when you return.  Hopefully most of your patients who reacted badly to the news will come around with some time, they are just fearful of the change.

> **Response 2:** For the patients giving pushback, I’d say good riddance. If they can’t wait for you to return, then it was probably good to get them off the caseload anyway. No patient should ever make you feel like they are more important than your family.

Best tips and tricks to avoid burnout?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just started following Brene Browns stuff and its amazing!

> **Response 2:** Take time to identify your values. (There are some good worksheets available to help with this process.) Then, ask yourself if how you're living is lining up with those.

Take time to learn about how you show up best at work, and do more of that. I love the Working Genius model for this. The assessment is about $20 I think, and well worth it. There is also a podcast by the same name that is honestly an amazing listen.

Take time to figure out the types of things that recharge you. MAKE TIME to do those things.

Take time to listen to your body. Learn how it tells you that you're stressed. And work with a counselor if possible to learn how to cope with the inevitable stress of life.

Give yourself permission to make beneficial changes.

If at all possible, work with a counselor.

I don’t know if this is allowed here, but I’m looking for a side hustle to hopefully get a little extra cash in to help me offset the high COL of SoCal. (If I could move-I would). I wanted to reach out here first to see if anyone is interesting in hiring someone like me to help with bookkeeping, scheduling, or transcribing your notes, etc. I’m a COTA by trade in home health. I am also a medical laboratory scientist and was in management at an ALF for some time, handling budgets, family communications, documents, etc. I have tons of experience. I do work full time in home health still, so it would be very part time and flexibility on hours is requested. Not looking for anything crazy on pay- hoping we can help each other in this area.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Would you message me?!

> **Response 2:** I’ve had friends who worked in HH and when their coverage was over the family still wanted care so he did concierge service for them. All cash paid. It’s a good amount that’s close to 50% of what he makes now in HH. He’s in SoCal as well 🫡

I've been subletting at a day spa for 3 years, i pay rent, talk to the spa owner almost every day. Last night she messages me that we have all been locked out of the office due to non payment. Landlord will not let me back in to get my stuff until spa pays rent. She is hopefull that she can  pay by Friday and we can get back to work (best case scenario), worst case scenario is i have to find another space by Monday to continue (It's just me, i no longer have staff). I am in Texas and just wondering if anyone has some great legal suggestions or if you have lived this hell before. Somehow it never occured to me that she was not paying rent. I will not post anonymously, and being in a small town, will do my best not to say to much about her.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Update: I got my stuff out of the spa yesterday thanks to the landlord, and this weeks location I am officing out of my parents empty rent house. Adapt and roll!!

> **Response 2:** Brenda, what does your contract say for the sublease? There’s normally provisions in them for things like this.  At the very least, I would be starting to look around for a new location.  This is clearly not someone you can trust with your business.

Has anyone tried like non synchronous video/virtual eval and programming for people? scenario - gym member tells me he has shoulder pain but can’t take time off work to attend a formal visit in office. We trouble shoot via videos and messages back and forth and then create a program for him to do. Its slower of a process but we could make it more fluid with q-a form for them to fill out with a video. Charge for 30 min or hour for time taken to use PT skills to do set time frame for services (6-8 weeks etc) Follow up 1-2x a week as needed. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Kelly this is actually the only thing that I do. Currently 100% remote and doing programming for my clients. Happy to answer any questions or even hop on a call to show you what I use

> **Response 2:** I’ve done this for patient before as well. I find that 30 minutes is about all you need for education/ questions and show them any new correctives

Hello all! I have a liability insurance question for you all. I’ve been using MyPTInsurance, and I pay roughly $300 a year. I see a lot of posts where people are paying closer to $1,000 a year, can anyone provide any guidance if I’m adequately covered using this policy? Photo of coverage attached. Thanks team!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is what I use as well.  I paid an extra fee extra dollars to list all the companies I work/ contract for in addition to my own small mobile practice.  But it's still way cheaper than others. Less than 400.

> **Response 2:** If you let them know you don’t do medication management or wound care it’s usually much cheaper

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That looks like a scam to me, there's a lot of that going around. Although, I don't see the harm in replying like Melanie suggested. I'd say you can't go wrong either way, but glad your guard is up.

> **Response 2:** Put some boundaries such as pretend you have a secretary direct it to your business number and send them an intake form they can fill out so that you can automatically look into their case. Emphasize that they need to fill it out in order to proceed to step 2.

I feel so blessed and grateful 😇 I have full control of my schedule and I can spend time with my children !! I can see it’s making a huge impact on them in positive way !!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s the best feeling isn’t it?  On Tuesday I saw an 8:00 patient came home took my daughter to figure skating, went out and saw two more patients and came back to make dinner for the family and watch my son’s swim meet. Earned as much money as working 13 hours at my previous job where I would have had to see about 25 patients at least. Been full time in my business a year now and it still feels like I’m cheating. Haha I guess 20 years of being conditioned to work for someone else will do that.

I know this question has been asked, but I still haven’t found the perfect solution…

I’m looking for a web based phone and text message solution for my business. I already have a phone number to port, but I would like to have the ability to add extensions to that number to route to my other therapists cell phones, so that they don’t have to give their cell phone number to patients. Also need the ability to send/receive text messages from that phone number.

I don’t need any fancy system that can send out marketing campaigns or extra services…just the basics.

I currently have 8x8, but their customer support and inability to solve text message issues is frustrating. Currently paying about $70/month, so looking to stay in that range.

Any suggestions appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look into dialpad. I don’t know all specifics but do know it has the capabilities that you’re describing

> **Response 2:** Just switched to Dialpad and really like it! Went from ring central… stay away!

Has anyone here bought an existing PT business? I may have a perfect opportunity to take over a PTs brick and mortar in my hometown as he’s retiring. I’m not sure what questions to ask and how to go about this. Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I bought one in 2020. Took over for a couple PTs who were getting out of the game. Definitely a lot of questions I didn't think to ask; now that I've been at it for a while, I'd want morr specific info. Big ones were: payer mix, clinical operation metrics, admin metrics, and terms of the deal (huge one)

> **Response 2:** I have bought a practice from a retiring PT and exited a PT business as well. I would be happy to discuss whatever questions you may have. If I cannot answer them I can refer you to a CPA and M and A attorney that I work with.

Does anyone have experience on how to hire a new therapist? I have been working to many hours. What is the best way to advertise? LinkedIn seems expensive. What do you think of indeed? Do you have your new therapist sign a contract? iI so any suggestions on where to go to learn how to make a contract? Or do I need a lawyer? (just not sure what to put on the contract. ) ￼ would appreciate anyone’s experience. I have been hesitating, because I’m not sure what I’m getting myself into🙃 any advice on this subject would be appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

What brace is everybody’s favorite for offloading OA in the knee

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If it’s unilateral then I like to use a heel wedge. For example if they have medial pain, then I’ll try a lateral heel wedge to apply a gaping force to the medial side.  It’s been very effective, but if not, the patient is only out six or eight dollars. ￼￼

> **Response 2:** If you get incrediwear it is a wearable anti inflammatory sleeve that has I think it’s germanium in it that some how helps with the OA pain from reducing inflammation not sure about the research behind it but I’ve seen it as a part of my companies many partnerships!

Want to give a big shout out/huge thanks to David Bayliff & Kevin DeGroot for helping me hit a milestone I wasn’t sure I’d ever see - my business is DEBT FREE!  

I participated in Traction Week back in April, and did some major refocusing and restructuring using what I learned. While I had made some progress since the beginning of 2025, I still had a hefty balance thanks to some unexpected but unavoidable large expenses.

I’m not a traditional uncaged business (wellness focused but I work with animals as well as people, and I’m hybrid mobile/office), but I have learned so much from the amazing free resources here - the podcasts, the blogs, Traction Week, etc - and I would not have made it here without this group. So THANK YOU!! Now to work on a new business plan so that i can grow beyond “solopreneur” status 🥳🎊

Okay the marketing for StemWave is blasting me haha has anyone used it? They have some seriously strong claims. I am just looking at different investments for the future since non PT staff can operate it. But it’s got a huge price tag!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go with Curamedix/storz. I had a stemwave and gave it back within the trial period. They have no data supporting their device, they’ve made their own protocols where “less seems to work better” but really it’s bc the cost of the electrode consumable is so high.  

ALSO…I found out they are selling the device to just about anyone including non professionals like “muscular activation specialists”. I think on that principle alone we’re diluting the value of our services and shouldn’t support a company like that.

> **Response 2:** Ginger Morrissey can speak to stem wave and a competitor (SoftWave) since she tried both

For those who have used the Nubis for awhile, how has it held so far? How is customer service? Is it comfortable? I am looking for a table I can carry as a backpack and easily take it upstairs. I don't want to invest in something that breaks easily and cannot readily repair. Thanks! 

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am going on 2 years with using my @nubis-physio  Works great for my patient population and a mobile PT Biz.  DM for any questions.  I purchased direct from @nubis-physio in Slovenia.  Took a couple of weeks to arrive put completely satisfied with product.  Yes pump is noisy for 20-30 sec to inflate/deflate, put to be honest, clients are impressed with the table!  I start exercises and discussion while setting up.  Portability is unparalleled.  In full transparency, after 5-6 clients in one day, I am done setting it up as a mobile therapist!  I purchased prone face pillow, kneeling pad, and inflatable bolster as accessories.  I use them all.  Highly recommend!  As far as the price differential compared to a traditional folding table...in my opinion totally worth it.  8-10 patients pays for it depending on your price per visit.  Can be rolled like a suitcase of carried like a backpack.  You choose.  Recently in Texas during icey conditions, I "backpacked" it instead of rolling.  Hope this helps answer some questions out there!

> **Response 2:** I inquired over 2 years ago. Still haven't pulled the trigger but keep questioning it myself, too. My brief email exchange with the vendor wasn't all too productive. They're agreeable to sharing product specs and whatnot but won't commit anything verbally to describe or back their longevity. My concern with portable tables has always been the value of the purchase. The wear on typical massage folding tables is probably ballpark 5 or so years, so I'd be getting value of about $30/year roughly - a heckuva lot more affordable. So it comes down to how much I might value the actual premium features of the Nubis.
The warranty btw is only 2 years.

I love what I get to do for work but this year so far has been stressful. 

I started this program 8 weeks ago because I hadn’t done a great job taking care of myself even though that’s what I talk to our clients about all the time. 

Today feels like a good day to have this test as the culmination of that program and a day where I’m so grateful for the incredible people around me who challenge me and encourage me to take care of myself 

If you’re going through a season, keep going. Advocate for yourself. Surround yourself with quality people who love and support you.

**Original Post:**
Ever have a former patient reach out for services again… but you’re not comfortable treating them?

I’m in a situation where I could use some guidance.
A patient I treated years ago in a clinic found my mobile practice after calling the old clinic, and I treated him privately about two years ago. Clinically, it was fine — he improved, and we discharged when skilled PT was no longer needed.

However, during those visits he would occasionally make comments that made me uncomfortable. Nothing overt, but enough that I remember feeling uneasy. He’s very blunt and tends to laugh things off, and at the time I let it slide and continued with care.

Fast forward two years — he recently contacted me again for PT. On the intake call he mentioned going to a large corporate clinic and compared their approach (“they had me lifting way heavier weights than you did”), so I clarified *why* I had chosen lighter loads at the time due to his deconditioning. He seemed to understand, but something about restarting care with him doesn’t feel right to me.

I’m struggling with how to professionally and ethically decline without worrying he might change or remove the positive review he left in the past.
Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it while maintaining boundaries and professionalism?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not taking new clients at the time. I appreciate your interest.

> **Response 2:** Trust your gut. Tell him you have a waiting list and he should contact  “PT at ……”. That you have put in a good word so they will take excellent care of him

EDIT: I can’t tag any of the team so hopefully they will see this 🤞🏻

I just want to give a shoutout to the Uncaged team - after catching the April 1 live podcast, I have started listening to other episodes of the pod during my runs (marathon & dopey challenge training… so.much.running) and all I can say is WOW. 

If you haven’t listened to any of their pod, you are missing out on some incredible insights. I haven’t gone in any particular order so far, I’ve picked episodes that the title/description speaks to something I’m struggling with, curious about, etc so don’t feel like you have to start all the way back at the beginning. 

Every single episode, I’ve had at least a handful of times where I find myself saying (out loud because I talk to myself when I’m running alone ha!) “yup, that’s me” or “yup I totally do that” or “huh, never thought of it that way” or “wow I need to try that.” I should probably listen when I am in a position to take notes, because there’s so many little gold nuggets of knowledge I want to remember! I’m not practicing OT at this point in my business, but there is SO much that is applicable to anyone who works for themselves or wants to do so eventually. 

So, long story short - huge shout out to the UC team especially on the podcast. You all are so generous with your wealth of knowledge, please know that it is appreciated so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Kate Myers Baccus wow thank you! 🙏. Thank you so much for your kind words, you have no idea how appreciated they are. Our team works hard at putting out great content, and a post like this makes it all worth it. Thank you for taking the time to share, we appreciate you! Hope we continue to encourage you, motivate you, and inspire you on your long runs 👊

> **Response 2:** Yes!! So good!

I’m at the VERY beginning of thinking about becoming uncaged. I’ve posted before: I have 1 yo twins and a 4 yo. Husband has a stable job and decent insurance I could get on. My question: how do you ladies or people capable of carrying children or men who want paternity leave deal with a new baby? I’ve been able to work up to a week before kiddo is here, but I really enjoy having 3 months off afterward (mostly to get them to start sleeping a LITTLE). 
Edited to add: not currently pregnant but we want more after we recover from the twins. 

How do you handle parental leave if you’re on your own (financially, but also what do you do with your caseload?)??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I found out I was pregnant shortly after I started my business but I was able to save enough for a 4 month maternity leave within that timeframe. I did not have anyone to see my patients when I was off so I discharged or put them on hold and all patients were incredibly understanding and supportive. That being said, I supplemented my income by working PRN at a hospital 4-6 days a month. With my business I went from 1-2 patients per week (for the first 4 months) to 6-7 per week until I gave birth. 

It can be done. Plant lots of seeds and they will grow. If you need to find a supplement like PRN, I recommend it because it still helps carry us financially when caseload is slow and now we have 2 kids in daycare.

> **Response 2:** Started planning for it pretty much as soon as I knew I was pregnant and wanted to take ￼time off. Made sure to communicate very early on with patients so they weren’t surprised- was able to discharge some, refer to other therapists if referrals came closer to due date, ￼ and started saving as well. I was able to take about a month off before baby was born, and about two months afterwards. ￼So I’d say early communication and planning make it doable!

What I learned about business from hiking Angels Landing with my fam. I’m terrified of heights, and they say if you’re scared of heights, this hike ain’t for you. Yet, there I was, freaking out, trying to lead my kids through my own panic. Spoiler: I wasn’t exactly killing it.
I was barking orders, making the experince miserable for everyone, demanding my kids follow my every barked order. Thank God for my wife, Tiffany Berardinelli   —she’s the real MVP. She brought calm to my chaos, stedying me and our whole family when I was sinking.

Looking back, I’m kinda embarrassed about how I acted. So, how’s this tie to business? Here’s what I learneda d how it might help you….

1.  Fear screws up performance. You can’t scare people into doing their best—it just doesn’t work. Calm, steady support (like my wife) is what helps people push through when they’re freaked out or worried.

2.  Put people in the right roles. Me, scared of heights, leading a hike full of sketchy ledges? Terrible call. Should’ve let Tiffany take the lead from the jump—she’s got the calm for it. I fought her for control out of fear, and that was dumb. Make sure your leader’s got the right headspace to bring peace to the team. It’s how people thrive.

3.  Always review your own performance, not just your team’s. Be real with yourself and course-correct, even if it means stepping back. Swallowing your pride to let someone better lead is tough—I didn’t do it on the hike, and it showed. You might be that person in your bisiness, and that’s okay, as long as you make the change.  That is real leadership.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great reflection and advice. I have to commend you on something you did that was positive:  learn from your experience. Even better…you shared the experience with others.

> **Response 2:** Went there last year. Most amazing trip! And having my kid up there who is an daredevil unlocks more fears, so I totally get it. Glad you're having a beautiful trip!

I would appreciate direction since I am clueless when it comes to websites and technology. What would be my cheapest and easiest option for a very simple website for a virtual PT/health coaching business. I am looking for a simple site, could like to have a “store” with links to affiliates and selling resources that I would send via email. Also looking for the cheapest/easiest way to schedule and take payment. Not sure if this is part of webpage ojust need ability to link to it. I have no clue what I’m doing here so any advice is appreciated. I can’t figure out where to start.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a site in Google. It was fine for my needs. I use Google claendar to schedule/let pts schedule. And wave app is free for collecting payments, other than the typical credit card fees. You can send invoices etc.

> **Response 2:** I have used Wix. It is about 30 a month. Very easy to use and the mobile app is decent. I have used siteground and Wordpress which is 10 a month but it way more of a headache

**Community Responses:**

Office manager took responsibility for learning the billing end of things and I’m still catching up on learning that. Kind of a long onboarding to learn it all but overall it has been better than the other system used and has more support. I would recommend personally if your plan is to grow.

For those of y'all who started as generalists/see everyone/jack of all trades.....and niched down, what was your thought process? How did you land on? What has become your single focus? Did you just pick an Avenue, figure out which avatar was the most profitable or which one you enjoyed working with the most? Just looking for feedback and mindset for narrowing down. Thanks y'all! ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had to learn by picking the wrong niche first … I was feeling frustrated and wasn’t sure why.  Once I really took a deep dive into where that frustration came from it gave me more clarity on the direction I needed to go.

> **Response 2:** I know this answer might not be for you or anyone else around here but you asked how we niched down. 

I specifically asked God what He wanted me to do. Then did it. Nothing like the Lord directing your steps.

One of the whys we all want is time freedom. Mine is coming from more of a personal reason or family need. I have been working in home health for the flexibility of scheduling. But have to leave the company I am with because it is overwhelming. But I am a father of a soon to be 16 yo autistic son high functioning but have to put him into virtual schooling and he looses out on extra curricular activities he was in high school he enjoys. Because me and my wife both work in health care and don’t have abilities to take him or pick him up from these activities if he chose to stay in high school where he is now. 
So to anyone else who has a child with special needs, I can understand a big why we do what we strive to do with our businesses. Not a rang but sharing my story and struggles because I know I am not alone. Thanks for reading. Now have a crushin week y’all. 👊🏻

Clinicians that treat TMJ/TMD do you have any tips for getting started in that field?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good background education understanding the interrelationships between the head/neck/tmj, then reviewing common pathologies, studying surgeries, then shadow local maxillofacial surgeons and dentists in the area. 

If that doesn’t work bring donuts

> **Response 2:** I've found a good local dentist is the easiest in.  Like all offices make friends with the office people and they will get you in front of the the dentist.  I usually say something like I specialize in TMJ and wondered how I could help yall out.  Bridging to an orthodontist and now I have a surgeon who will refer before he sees someone pretty often.  Takes time, be consistent and send a letter when you see the patient not a copy of your evaluation.  Other than that what's been said above.  DM if you have any other questions.

Hi everyone! I’m close to launching my virtual personal training business (geared towards people with invisible illnesses- POTS, Long Covid, etc.) and could use some help. 
I am in need of consent form, waivers, and general screening forms. 
I was also wondering if anyone had a form made up stating that the client understands that this is not a physical therapy session (I’m a PTA).

Any recommendations for liability insurance and the best company to go through for selling merchandise (hats, t-shirts, etc.). I’m considering going through Etsy, but didn’t know if there was a better option. 

Thanks in advance!

Had an interesting experience. My daughter suffered an accident sledding and got hurt. They have in our area an orthopedic specific urgent care. 
The receptionist asks what happened, goes inside and come back with an X-ray slip. You do X-ray and return. They then have a certified athletic trainer call us in, take history measure ROM, strength, and some tests… and finally an ortho comes in for 5-10 min, reads X-ray, palpates, do an US, and gives his opinion. ATC then returns to teach how to use crutches.
That was a new experience for me and I am curious on how they bill for ATC…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Most likely they are not billing it. They are using the AT much like a medical assistant. I have worked in a practice that uses this model. The benefit of ATs in the ortho urgent care model like this is really great imo.

Would you mind leaving as a review of the quality of service I've been able to provide you so that others can know there is hope for them just like you have experienced? 

Then I send them a text like this:

Hi ___, Thank you again for trusting me to help you to regain confidence with ___. It's always great to hear when people like you feel more confident and empowered to do more than you thought was possible. 

Below is a link for my business page  and I would consider it a gift if you would take 60 seconds to let others know about the experience I've been able to provide for you to start getting back to find what you love.

Would love to learn about more revenue generating products that are helpful to patients. Eg. Good quality Pillows, products for better posture etc.

Or if you did it yourself, how difficult is that and comparative cost?

Did anyone in this awesome group start and successfully grow an OON/direct pay brick-and-mortar practice without going mobile first, and without pre-established referral sources? Would love to connect.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm brick and mortar, it's a great base, and now working on building the online presence.

> **Response 2:** I started brick and mortar, OON, no referral sources. Initial start up was $13,000 from my savings and never had to put my own money in after that. Now, I also did not get a paycheck for 2 years after that as I rolled all the money I made into the business. It's certainly an option and I am happy to chat if it would help. I think it depends on what you NEED to make in order to live your life. For me, I was able to get insurance through my husband and he was able to cover living expenses while I got this company off the ground. But, I understand that is not true for everyone. I think that mobile offers the opportunity to put more money in your pocket from the beginning due to low overhead. The question is - what do you need and what do you want?

**Original Post:**
Vulnerability. 

I share some of my personal struggles because it's important for people here to see a couple different things. 

1.  It's possible to LOVE life and still have struggles. I love what I get to do, I love who I get to work with, I'm proud of what I've accomplished and live an amazing life. I also struggle with doubts, mindset and mental health issues, and have days that are hard. This is life and even though it seems like people who are successful never have a bad day, thats BS. 
1. It's ok for a leader to show vulnerability. In fact, it's essential. I can't do things on my own. I need others to help me. I need to recognize that despite my best efforts I'll fall short unless surrounded by others to help support me. There's a misconception that building a business on your own is the "courageous" way of doing it. We live in a society where individual work is celebrated and using a team or others to support you is often seen as "cheating" (see school as an example). Trying to do things on your own will get you limited results and the primary reason that people do things on their own is PRIDE. They don't want to show vulnerability because of their pride so they do things on their own and never admit they need help. So by showing my vulnerability I hope to help people see that the smart way, the brave way, the courageous way of doing things is to recognize limitations and ask for help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is exactly what I have found out and am taking action on with myself and my team. Thank you for sharing since this resonates with me so much!

> **Response 2:** This resonates with me so much! Probably one of the biggest lessons I have been learning since starting my practice.

Looking to hear any experience with using  StemWave in your practice. Both with the company/device itself and with patient results.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a StemWave device. It works wonders.  You can use it over prosthesis.  It is a shockwave therapy… but when you look into the type of wave they are all slightly different.  StemWave has the highest amplitude sound wave out of all of them…. Making the cells think they have microtrauma stimulating the healing response. 
Yes it’s loud…. But you choose the amount of energy you put into the patient.  The pain does not get better worse before it gets better as someone else said.  Most of my patients have a 70-80% pain relief in one visit.  
This has completely changed how I operate my clinic.

> **Response 2:** Not worth the money.  Poor research to support improvement on anything except plantar fasciitis.  
Pain increases before it decreases.  In my research I’ve found that you Can’t use on joint replacement because it can loosen the prosthesis. Also can make a partial tears worse.  It’s loud. Often patients can tolerate what’s considered the ‘therapeutic dose’

8 months of thinking (and researching, planning, seeking advice, and praying) is FINALLY turning into action. So stay tuned for lots of random questions! 😉…Here is the first one:
I’m almost done with my website for mobile cash only practice.  I’ve looked at several of your websites and notice almost nobody mentions  not being able to take Medicare for medically necessary services.  Is there a reason?…is it just a conversation you plan to have during that first phone call?  Just not sure how much detail to include up front..Thanks!

As a healthcare provider (PT), am I legally allowed to accept tips from cash pay clients for physical therapy?  How about for "wellness" services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t tell anyone, but I’ve personally never declined a tip 🫣

> **Response 2:** From the APTA code of ethics: “Physical therapists shall not accept gifts or other considerations that influence or give an appearance of influencing their professional judgment.” 

A “tip” may fall under that category but a “gift” may not.  

This doesn’t speak to the legality of it either.  I’d check your states practice act to see if it has any ethical regulations around this.

I have been on my own doing mobile PT for about a year and half now.  It seems like I am either crazy busy or super slow.  Does anyone else experience this? 
I had my biggest/busiest month in July, then slowed down a bit more each week in Aug and last week was my slowest week ever.  
Then, BAM!!  I got 3 new referrals on Friday and 2 more this week.  Now I am swamped again.  This roller coaster is going to give me a heart attack?!?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I experienced that ALL. THE. TIME.

> **Response 2:** I’ve been lucky to not have any real lows yet, but the balance of fear of never getting another referral if there is a quiet week vs total overwhelmed trying to sort out where to put everyone is REAL!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in BNI and have given 3 presentations so far. The first one was why MRIs aren't reliable in diagnosing back pain. The next one I brought my table and asked for someone with back pain, screened him and fixed all the pain in 10 mins. The last one was on gait deviations and how I know what is wrong with you based on how you walk. It was a fun to demonstrate different patterns.

> **Response 2:** Yes I've given bni presentations. Talking about how you can help the clients of other members and your specialty is best. Personally I left those grps.

I need opinions please! I’m struggling with the name of my business. My legal name is Gabbert Clinic PLLC and I have a DBA Gabbert Hand Therapy. I like the way it sounds but am worried about the possible future pitfalls of using my name (what if I wanted to sell it one day?). So other ideas I have:

1) ActionArm Hand Therapy
2) Action (Hand & Upper Extremity Rehab)
3) Action Hand Rehab
4) Columbia Hand Therapy (name of large river near us)
5) Hand Rehab of Vancouver 
6) StrongArm Hand Therapy
7) stick with my name

Thank you!!!!!

New Hampshire therapists! My best friend in the whole world is going through a barrage of neurological tests to determine the cause of a variety of symptoms. She reached out to me to get recommendations and I’m looking for your help to get her good therapists. 

She is looking for PT for dizziness/balance/gait instability, OT for cognitive impairments, and SLP because her neurologist recommended it. I know finding these in NH is tough, but she has great state insurance that she needs to use and is willing to put in the work. She’s a 41 year old mom of 3 and is having a LOT of major issues. She lives in the Lakes Region but knows she will have to travel. Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

For all the solo mobile practices out there, how do you handle time out of the office greater than a week? I’m going to be out of the area for 2 weeks. Do you bring in another PT to help out as an independent contractor? Do your clients simply wait until you return? Would love to hear what you all do.  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We left and closed the clinic for 3 weeks last year, no issues. We made sure patients had extensive HEP activities and stressed compliance. I was available via email in case of questions or concerns. No declines while I was gone, but it did take a bit of prep prior. Outpatient neuro.

> **Response 2:** I let them know ahead of time and review any questions of their HEP. Seemed to work out well for me, surprisingly many are happy that I actually take time off. For those who have been coming for a while we sometimes use it as a test to see how they do on their own.

This question is for all the lymphedema therapists treating Medicare patients...I had a contractor tell me yesterday her hospital-based outpatient PRN job stated Medicare will only pay 1-3 visits for bandaging now. Compression bandaging (Short Stretch) is consider not skilled after 3 visits by Medicare. What??? Anyone have experience with this?  I have not received any denials but I would love to avoid them if possible.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Bandaging has never been considered skilled.  Patient education/caregiver training.

Looking to start a mobile PT business and got a quote for malpractice insurance which I thought was really steep based on the research I’ve done. I know there are a lot of factors, but does $1500/yr seem steep to you? 

I am the only PT in the business and have 8 years experience. Thanks so much for your input and if you have any insurance carriers in mind send them my way:)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got a quote for around $700 with CM & F. Curious though, many people are saying you only need professional when you're just starting out, but I was under the impression that you need the general/business to cover your workplace (I'll be treating out out of my home, want coverage incase someone trips, etc)

* flexible/self-determined schedule
* autonomy and consistency with their patients
* and to provide the highest quality one-on-one care for 60-90 minute sessions

We are two genuine, honest, passionate moms who got tired of working for the traditional healthcare system and decided we could do it better. We say we provide an Elevated PT experience for our clients, but we also want to provide an Elevated employee experience. Please respond or share with anyone you know may be interested.

I wanted feedback on whether or not you would place a patient is prone or right side lying who had a 1 time episode of BPPV that was corrected in 2 PT visits without a return of symptoms in over a year. I'm trying to work on neck ROM but she's reluctant to get into these positions.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Education.  They should not be afraid of movement !!

> **Response 2:** research doesn't support any restrictions in positioning

My city's chamber of commerce is hosting a senior expo. The organizer estimates about about 500 people attended in prior years, and there are 80 vendors. 
Seems like an ideal space to market, however a table space is $500. What do you all think? Are these events worth the price of admission, or should I simply show up to the event itself in branded t-shirt and business cards and start networking without the table space? 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great feedback everyone.  It was definitely better to navigate the crowd than to have a table. Thanks to Mike chua for the recommendation to video, and Anthony for the suggestion to use Jeremy Sutton's approach towards local small businesses. I got to interview a couple of businesses and it made for a more interesting and engaging experience.

> **Response 2:** Only worth it if you can afford doing it. I would rather attend the expo as a "curious" person and learn about their services and what they do and then you mention how you could help their business as well and swap info. Use those connections to try and provide free workshops for people that they help.

Is anyone familiar with the BERG test item 13 when they stand on one leg?  How do you grade it when they can stand on one leg 30 seconds and the other leg is not as long?  Its been a while and my thought is score 0 (needs assistance)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I meant the tandem test not SLS test, but either way, on item 13 or 14 it does not specify how to grade bilaterally when the patient can do the task completely fine on one leg but not the other leg (or tandem with right in front versus left in front).   Therefore in my mind if they can not do the task bilaterally I am being conservative to give a lower score.  What does everyone else do?

Has anyone offered just a small side service, such as soft tissue mobilization? I  am considering talking with my gym owners about offering the occasional upper extremity (just sticking to hand/wrist/forearm) STM for gym members. Considering cash-based 15 minute sessions, and just having supplies with me since it would just be an occasional offering, and I wouldn’t be setting up permanent office space. Not a series of full “rehab”, but would recommend they see their provider and hand therapist if it appeared they had an injury that could use a full evaluation. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
Hi y'all! I'm in need of a recommendation! I treat competitive swimmers. A particular female swimmer of mine (high school aged) presented with (bil) shoulder pain in the middle of the summer. She has done 9 PT appts with me (1x/week). Per her words, she no longer has pain but does have a lingering soreness in the anterior shoulders during and after practice. The soreness is not severe enough to have her get out of the water. 

She has horrible shoulder posture and also has a larger chest. Her mother informed me that she has had horrible posture for years (her mother is reportedly always on her case about her posture). I wholeheartedly believe her continued soreness is a result of her posture.

Her mother has asked for a recommendation on a posture bra. I know nothing about posture bras except for what I found during a quick google search. Seems they are built with a mechanism similar to the posture braces that promote scapular retraction. I'm not fond of these braces long-term. I would rather see her continue to strengthen her periscapular muscles and improve her shoulder/scapular stability.

BUT...would a posture bra be a good short-term solution? Can anyone provide any more insight than what you can find googling and/or particular brands recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Instead of putting a growing adult into some sort of “posture bra” you should educate her mother that there is very little research that supports “perfect posture” and the reason for her pain is because the child is most likely from trying to maintain that posture that her mother expects. Allow the child to sit how they like and let their shoulders relax, I would be surprised if her pain still lingers after that adjustment.

> **Response 2:** As a large chested woman, I’d focus more on getting her in a correct sized bra. Posture bras do nothing. Instead, she needs to go to a bra fitting store, or Nordstrom. They need to be prepared to spend money… good bras are not cheap. More than likely, she’s gone to target or Victorias Secret and is trying to fit herself in to the bras that are available. When she is in a bra that fits, the band should be quite snug. That’s where the support comes from. Cup size and band size are inversely related, so if her band has been too big her cup has probably been too small. Once she’s in the right size bra, then work on posterior chain strengthening to take some of the load off the biceps and pecs.

It’ll fit in my backpack, extends to 60” and the phone clip can rotate 90 degrees for portrait or landscape. 

I don’t have an affiliate link so if someone does and wants to take this and repost it, have at it! It’s like $25!!

**Community Responses:**

They also come in all paper packaging products and they have a mission to plant trees to give back to the environment when you print with them

> **Response 2:** I use a local print shop, the quality is so much better and prices are too. Plus I can send the file over and they make sure it all looks good before printing. I like helping out another small business owner also ☺️

Recommendations for a business checking account when you’re just starting out and have no income (so trying to avoid fees!)?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Novo is great! They’re all online, so if you want a physical bank they’re not the one, but otherwise I’ve had a good experience with them.

> **Response 2:** I just opened an account with Bluevine this morning! I chose them because they have no fees on account maintenance or transactions and no minimum balance requirement. You can also add sub accounts to help organize your money without having to open up several separate checking accounts. You earn 1.5% in interest too. They came recommended on Forbes and Nerd Wallet. They are an online banking compny, so if you’re looking for physical branch locations, I’d look elsewhere. Obviously since I just opened it this morning I can’t speak to how they are in the long term, but those are the things I liked about them! Hope that helps!

What would be good options for a COTA that wants to be the owner of an OT business?

Since COTAs need an OTR for supervision, co-signing notes, evals/discharges, to write goals, etc.…I’m struggling with how to get a business going when I don’t have the money to hire an OTR. Not until the business starts making money. How would I navigate that?

I’m interested in having a mobile OT practice that sees patients throughout the lifespan, & was thinking about taking Medicare, Medicaid, be OON for other insurances, & cash.

I’m located in Idaho, if that makes a difference.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a PTA who owns a pelvic therapy clinic. I started by talking to PTs I had already worked with to see who would be willing to do some evals for me. I am a cash clinic so I’m able to pay well and I have a great working relationship with many PTs. I had a taker and she just works 4-8 hours per month doing evals PRN around her other schedule. I now have a second location with another PT that gives me 4-6 hrs per month. I do all treatments. 
Start networking, be generous as you fiscally can and flexible with schedule and you might be surprised who is open to working for you.

For the love of PT and mental health of all practitioners,
How does one start?!

We recently moved states. 

Interviewing at run-of-the-mill or half-a-notch above low expectations clinics after obtaining the local license, I just feel like walking  up the proverbial downstairs escalator.  

What got me most recently was the answer of a posh 1:1 practice place owner “if you maxed out of your 2 weeks of PTO, just take an unpaid day, we understand life happens”

3 years out of PT school, an LMT cross-over.  My patients knew and appreciated my touch and my passion to educate them onto their breakaway into strengthening from pain be it a trauma, post-op, or repetitive stress injury. 

I don’t want to be a PT drone anymore, ever. 

How does one start with little to no money down, like individual attention home health sessions, a gig at a gym, a personal acquaintance referral?..

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had an AWESOME PTA who I adored. She was amazing with patients and everyone loved her. One day, she walked into my office, handed in her notice, and said she was going to MT school. She has now opened her own place (in her house), treats 5 hours a day/4 days a week and charges $120 an hour. She is killing it! And, she is so happy. Honestly, I probably could have never matched that amount for salary. Not to be digging on myself (she actually gives me credit for building her confidence enough to make the move) but...get creative. If you are still an LMT it's easier to get people to pay cash. You could create an entire niche "All the benefits of massage with the knowledge to help you build strength". Whatever, come up with something more marketable, but you get my point.

> **Response 2:** Follow your passion. Some start with a table in a car, some start with a corner in a gym. Go to where your people are and do it with passion and you’ll find a way.

Seeking  help for a kiddo. That will not wear socks. He is 6 and understands but refuses to wear socks, the most time he would wear them around one minute before taking them off any helpful intervention ideas or unique sensory ideas

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m guessing there are more sensory issues than just socks. 

Getting an OT eval could help the family understand the big picture of the kid’s sensory system and preferences so he can live more comfortably and he/parents/teachers can understand his needs. 

I’d go for the root issues rather than just working on socks. 🩵

> **Response 2:** If he doesn't like socks, what if instead he rotates between pairs of shoes and focus is on hygiene? Knowing that wearing no socks is okay, but washing feet, and other things may be needed to help keep feet and shoes healthy. 

I hate wearing socks and shoes myself. I wear them, but I can't wait to get home and take them off. Same with gloves, I hate gloves.

Curious if he shared why he doesn't like socks? I think knowing why might help if that's something that's been asked and told.

Has anyone had issues in NYS getting their PLLC name approved? I really wanted to use Moving Mountains Physical Therapy but it was rejected because it’s “promissory.” I then submitted breaking grounds which was also rejected for the same reason.

I have no idea what to name it other then my last name or the city of which it is going to be established in without it getting denied. Any help or suggestions greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

Hi all! 

Just had a potential lead at a gym ask me what I think of the hip hook? My initial reaction was “the what”? She started to explain it and I get what it’s for but before she invests in anything like this, I told her I’d ask around and she if anyone knows of good results, if any, with that gadget. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not a fan at all.  

I practice visceral manipulation and the structures anterior to the iliacus are also compressed by the hip hook. I’ve had more than one person come for treatment that has injured the ligament of cleyet, cecum, sigmod, etc by using it.

> **Response 2:** It’s nonsense. You cannot palpate the iliopsoas. It’s wayyyy too deep. Any relief you may get is due to noxious stimulus or placebo and is short term.

Hi Everyone! My wife and I own multiple fitness studios in Chicago. Our latest studio, in the Gold Coast neighborhood, has a large space available that we were thinking could be perfect for an "uncaged" physical therapist practice. Does anyone here have any ideas for how we could find someone interested in leasing part of our space? Our fitness studio has capacity to serve 500+ customers each week, and we get inquiries all the time from members looking for a PT, so there would be embedded demand for any PT that partners with us. We also have LOADS of equipment we use for our classes (treadmills, air bikes, kettle bells, dumbbells, med balls, pull-up bars, barbells, etc.), along with full locker rooms. Let me know if anyone has any thoughts, or knows of anyone that could be interested!

**Community Responses:**

This is a HUGE passion project for me. Work and Leadership through the lens of faith. 

I'm hosting a 6 week intensive focused on developing as leaders. 
Starting June 1 at 8:00 am EST, 6 weeks work and leadership intensive through the lens of faith (If we have enough request for an evening time I'll host 2x/week. All sessions will be recorded for watching after as well)

Week 1. Calling, Equipping, Your Why? 
 - We’re often told to think about our “why?” What does this mean and where is your why coming from? 

Week 2. What gets in the way? Our Stories
 -Each of us has a history of wins, lessons, trials, tribulations, successes and seeming failures. Each of these has a voice that comes with them that competes for our attention. Which voice is loudest to you and what does that mean towards you progressing towards your goals?

Week 3. Enneagram 
 -We often focus on our strengths and weaknesses but how do you view yourself in terms of your motivation and how do you communicate that to yourself and others? 

Week 4. Boundaries
 - We’ve all been told that having boundaries is important but how do you understand the tension between boundaries and the calling to love, serve, care and lead? 

Week 5. Creating Resilience 
 - what is the process we need to go to become more resilient people and leaders? 

Week 6. Stand and Lead
 - What do you stand for? What do you aspire to be as a leader?

We’ll be reading 2 different books included in the price of the 6 week intensive. Strong and Weak by Andy Crouch and Tempered Resilience by Tod Bolsinger. The cost of an Enneagram assessment is also included in the cost of the program so please sign up early so you can get access to the readings in advance! 

NOTE: We'll be discussing faith through a Christian focus but all are welcome, I just want to be transparent about the direction I'm coming from.

**Community Responses:**

Who has done a small group workshop? I'm used to doing formal presentations and a patient invited me to come to her home and talk to her and five of her other friends about general health, wellness, and exercise. 

Just looking for some tips to have it be conversational and educational.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just did one!! It was much more my speed. I did it for a group of 70 year old ladies that make cards and do crafts all day as their hobbies. I did a presentation on arthritis. And then I followed up the 30 minute discussion with a demonstrating 3 stretches for the hands and wrists. 3 ladies of the 5 booked an evaluation. Very personal and professional. 
Before hand I had the ladies submit via text or call one to two questions on what they want to learn about arthritis.

> **Response 2:** We try to break up our presentations with self assessment tests and/or bring up a volunteer to perform tests on in front of everyone to keep them engaged

Anyone who has started a mobile practice, what address are you using when forming your LLC? Ideally I’d like to keep business and home separate just for security purposes, but I don’t have a brick and mortar location. Can I use my home address and change the address later? I’m just starting the process so, help me please😅.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use my home address. I still use it on all my paperwork. I have several brick and mortar and the main business address is still my home. I want the nails to go to my home address. 😁😁😁

Some use PO boxes which I had before. Unfortunately, some insurance companies don't accept that. Is there a reason why you don't want your address? Safety for what? Our address is public anyway. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** I used a registered agent, very cheap and then their address is used as my business address.

**Original Post:**
Hi everyone! I am looking to start my own cash-based practice. I have specialty experience in both pelvic health and spinal deformities(scoliosis/schuermanns etc), both of which I feel are underserved populations. I would also like to start teaching Pilates again. A few questions:

1) Where do I begin when starting my practice? I live in TN, I’m relatively new here, I’m using the compact agreement between TN and NC. I have an idea of services and the model I want to use, but the legalities of starting a practice confuse me. I don’t plan on accepting any insurance. 

2) If I start simple, with only offering private Pilates lessons (no PT), does this conflict with my PT license? I’ve been told that the liability will always fall on my PT license, even if I am only offering personal training/Pilates. I have a 4 month old at home and my husband is deployed, so I thought the private Pilates/personal training would be an easier place to start than PT services, but I don’t want to have any conflict or fail to follow any rules. For those that offer both personal training and PT, how do you keep the 2 separate? 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading, hoping those questions make sense!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Where in Tennessee? I'm here at Jackson. Good luck!!!

> **Response 2:** Hey I practice in TN and MS. I would suggest looking at the TN practice act. 

TN allows for you to provide wellness services and also allows 90 days of direct access if wanting to perform PT. I work with golfers and always just have inform the MD when 90 days is coming up and that allows direct access to continue. But I am not a lawyer, so take everything with a grain of salt. 

I highly recommend speaking with one of the Uncaged Coaches.

It’s been a while since I’ve had to give a 2 weeks notice to an employer, but my side gig has grown enough for me to do that. What are some tactful phrases you have used but kept your business future plans private from your current employer?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why keep them private? You’ve done nothing wrong by growing your own business and learning to butter your own bread.

I would tell them. A good employer/manager/leader will be happy for you and might help you form a symbiotic relationship.

Michigan PTs, we have a chance at Direct Access, removing the prescription requirement.   Will you sign this letter asking our senators to support it (you must be a resident of Michigan)?    If you live in Michigan, will you share this link to the letter with friends, family, neighbors, patients?   Ask them to sign!   We need to get growing support.  
https://forms.gle/kNbb4D4CTRQfES1SA
Background:  The Senate Health Policy Committee is reviewing SB 668.  If they approve it, SB 668 will go to vote in the Michigan Senate.  if it passes, it has to go to the House for consideration.   Today, Friday 4/19 at 1:30 pm EDT, I am going to a Meet & Greet with MI Sen. Mark Huizenga to bring him my letter, signed by any Michigan resident who supports this.   If you LIVE IN MICHIGAN, will you electronically sign my letter asking the Senate Health Policy Committee to support SB668?   You must live in Michigan.  Upon electronically signing, please include your residence City, State and Zip.  

PLEASE, ONLY MICHIGAN RESIDENTS SIGN. 

Thanks, everyone.  The Uncaged Clinician will surely benefit from this, as patients often find us directly, circumventing the physician visit.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Signed! Thanks Maureen!

> **Response 2:** I support this! But what about OT?! 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My CPA charges $500 for my biz and just under for personal so roughly 1k total. Unlimited emails, calls, questions. Meetings are billed. And he's amazing. He's always told me that they way I keep my books is up to me as long as he can make sense of it. I've used QB before but now use an old school excel sheet for sev businesses. I'd shop around. CPAs can cross state lines so you aren't locked in to local either.

> **Response 2:** I wish my CPA charged me only a grand.  I usually have to pay 2 1/2 times that.  $1k is a steal!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes me!  I went on maternity leave.  I stopped taking new patients about 2-3 months before I went on leave.  Then I got them to a discharge point as best as I could.  Most discharged and only a couple stayed on a monthly check in status.  For those patients I gave them a robust HEP and checked in with them a month later and they were doing great and so I discharged them

> **Response 2:** I’m due in 10 weeks & I just hired a PRN therapist to cover for me. Not sure how long I’m taking off but at least I’ll have some money coming in.

Has anyone switched specialties? Then gone to cash based?
Backstory: I have my NCS and work primarily with PD in OP hospital setting. The past few years I’ve felt that I need something new or different. I’ve always toyed with the idea of postpartum Pelvic floor or Peds (even in PT school) but have NO experience with either, except having a baby and being a postpartum pelvic floor patient myself once. I know I can do cash with Neuro but idk if I really want to. In my area PD is mostly Medicare and idk if I want to get into the grey area of wellness to accept cash from them. 
To be clear, I wouldn’t switch specialties for the sole purpose of doing cash. But if I did switch, the cash model maybe easier because of the younger populations wouldn’t be mostly Medicare.
I guess I want something different, more autonomy, and of course to get out of corporate healthcare but not necessarily with my current population.
If you have any insight, advice, or experience, I’d appreciate it. And with no experience in either specialty, where do you start?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you're switching to cash then you need to know what you're doing and be highly skilled in that field. If you are going after a niche then you need to convince people to choose you over others, and that your care is worth them foregoing the use of their insurance. Until you have found what you offer that is better than any other, then I wouldn't switch.

> **Response 2:** I don’t think it needs to be one or the other. There can be a continuum. 

It sounds like you want to break ties with your old identity and it’s easiest for you if the day to day looks different with a different patient population. If YOU need that then switch and send it.

Hey Uncaged Community! I’m looking for the wisdom of the SPORTS/ORTHO/RUNNING EXPERTS in this group! I received this text from a friend who is a long-time runner, triathlete, and Physician’s Assistant. Any advice? I’d love to connect her with anyone who offers virtual services/consults/advice and can help! She is located in Virginia.

“If it’s okay, I was hoping to pick your brain a bit? (Before I panic).

I ran my first race since my stress fracture almost 2 weeks ago now (April 23rd- 🎉) 9 months post stress fracture. I felt great, no pain, legs were just pretty sore the next day thanks to some tough hills.  

I got sick about mid week after my race, and still am currently sick (I believe they’ve lovingly called this runners flu)… I have been laid up since then feeling super run down and haven’t been able to run or really workout- trying to be smart and listen to my body. 

Earlier this week, my ankle started really bothering me- just some deep achy/annoying pain… and worse at night. Which raised some flags for me. The weather has been yuck so I attributed it to that at first. But the rainy/storms have passed and I’m still having a constant nagging ache. Worse when I’m just sitting and still worse at night. 

Have you ever heard of illness triggering that same “flare” of an old injury like weather does ? Or do you think it might be more cause for concern to check in/follow up on? 

It just doesn’t make sense to me. I felt great during my race and over a week past that I felt good and then all of a sudden it starts giving me trouble when I’m not even exercising…”

Thanks, ya’ll! ☺️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree that she should probably have it re-imaged to r/o stress fracture recurrence, but the fact that it is happening primarily when she is NWB and at the end of the day makes me think that there is also a possible referral from the spine or hip instead of pain from stress fracture. That deep, achey, can’t-be-touched pain could be from irritated neural or nerve-adjacent tissue. Or just muscular fatigue from possibly not ramping back up appropriately. 
I am also in VA and I offer free consultations online. They are welcome to book one of interested.

> **Response 2:** Immune system CAN flare symptoms in old injury site, but given she hasn't been training makes it hard to believe a new stress fx has developed. Imaging would rule out serious pathology, but I'm more inclined to believe a lumbar referral pattern or even local peripheral nerve issue. I'd figure out what nerve is in that area and try neurodynamics

Hey everyone! I got an interesting request from a potential prospective patient. Curious if anyone has done this before and if so, any suggestions? We are 100% cash based. 

Here is the question: “Because my injury was caused by a different party, I am working with an attorney in a settlement with the other party. While the settlement is being discussed, I am looking for a physical therapist who is willing to work with me on a lien-basis with my attorney’s office until the settlement is reached, as I do not have medical insurance.”

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Usually takes a long time to get paid from those and they usually will negotiate rates after the case settles.  I would ask if they can pay up front and then they can reimburse themselves with the money from settlement.

> **Response 2:** I have really close friends that are personal injury lawyers. They want to send me patients with liens but I’ve been super up front with them: $150 per visit or I’m out. They haven’t been able to guarantee that once. They also won’t agree to paying up front.

I’m interested in looking into doing home safety evaluations. I was curious if anyone has done this, if there’s any specific certifications for it, and if it’s even worth it with home care agencies and things that do this too? Also, how to even get started with something like this!

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would love to chat with you about this. I have been doing this for over 6 almost 7 years. I can send you some information on it. There is also a facebook group on it. Send me a DM if you want more information on home modifications.

What is your opinion of putting prices for services on your website? Good idea or not a good idea. I have mixed opinions because some people may be scared of the price and not inquire at all- but we’ve also been getting people contacting us trying to negotiate a lower rate. 

And what is your opinion on a set rate, but also offer a sliding scale for those in financial difficulties so we can help more of the population?

Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am honestly less likely to schedule with a person who does not have prices listed. Unless there is something else on the website that makes me think that I will not find a better place, I will not even contact. I am not more likely to schedule with someone if I have to contact them for prices. A price will turn me away if too high no matter if I have to contact them or not. Just my personal opinion, but that doesn’t mean it’s the majority’s opinion.

> **Response 2:** I don’t have my prices directly on my website but have a button that takes me to my booking site which shows my prices right away. I had the same thoughts as you about putting them on my site. I think it’s just your preference.

Patient care question for the group. Have a 79 year old women as a patient right now who is going on 6 weeks now of having a 8-10/10 pain that affects most of her right side from her rib cage down to her glutes (described as burning with shooting bouts of pain). 

We just started PT 2 weeks ago (she was undergoing testing by primary MD - X-rays and US without significant findings other than some OA) and have only been able to meet once due to scheduling conflicts. 

She struggles to do even very basic movements including seated flexion, side bending to open up space on the right side, and ant / post pelvic tilts in standing as she cannot tolerate any other positions. Tissue including glutes and paraspinals are very sensitive to touch. Lumbar ROM reveals increased pain with motions closing down space on facet joints on the R side but doesn’t recreate pain in rib cage / thoracic pain. Central and unilateral PAs reproduce some but not all of the areas of pain on the right side radiating into glutes between L3-L5. 

She does have a history of RA but mostly in her hands and has not had recent blood work. does anyone have experience with RA flare ups in the spine? She was on a steroid pack about 4 weeks ago which helped at the time but the pain returned shortly thereafter. 

I’m worried she is going to become reliant on pain medication / push towards a chronic pain state if this pain level continues to persist for too much longer.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This pain is not mechanical.  Have her see a rheumatologist

> **Response 2:** Hate that she is going through this! What did she have an US of? If this was my patient, maybe after 1-2 more in person visits, I would look at obtaining MRI or PET scan. Concerned if I am unable to recreate the pain with testing or alleviate pain with positioning or manual work. Rule out worst case scenario which could be cancer,  lower lobe, kidney￼￼? Hope this helps! Good luck

I have a silly question.  I like to send out Christmas cards to my client list with a gift certificate, but since I have grown this is now becoming quite the process to get everything addressed and mailed out. Plus the cost of postage and the cards themselves.  Does anyone send out physical cards and if so is there a system that makes it easy to upload mailing info so you aren’t hand writing everything. I’d love to hear ideas for what you do to show your appreciation for your clients with the goal being to have it feel personalized but cost and time effective.

I am a solid, unique, well versed PT who has been in practice for 17 years and who works with complex cases…oh and I often have impostor syndrome.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started with my Mac book pro and it was great but got tired of having to connect to my hotspot when I just needed to get a quick note done. I was also wearing it out, the keys were falling off. I just got an iPad and a case that has a keyboard. I bought a data plan and that solves the connection problem. But I miss having more capability on the days I have a longer break between clients.

Quick question for those who work with those who have become injured playing pickleball? I do work with older clients but am not familiar with the game of pickleball. I'm seeing several groin injuries and am curious what I can do to help these folks reduce the risk of this injury. I believe there is tightness in the adductors and IR of the hips but want to be sure I'm not missing something else.Thank you for any help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A big element I work on is footwork. Various foot work drills to help avoid the end ranges of motion during a game. 
…
We can’t change the 40 years of degeneration, but if we can help them move better within the a available range of motion maybe we can reduce the risk of injury.

> **Response 2:** I would say eccentric control of the adductors more than flexibility. There are lots of side to side motions. Think tennis but smaller movements. Lots of changing direction, reflex training, full body twists for swings, etc. Also I read somewhere that pickleball is one of the most "dangerous" sport in that there's the highest injury rate compared to#of players. I'm sure there's a caveat to that stat, maybe the highest rate in racket sports or something. Double check me on that. But there's definitely a huge patient population for us in pickleball!

I am a DME orthotic provider looking to partner with a physical therapist to add PT services to my clinic. I want to have the PT services as strictly private pay. However I am starting to question if I can do this since I have contracts with insurance for my DME services. I am especially wondering if this is true for Medicaid. The PT I have been talking to does have a Medicaid number, but does not have any contracts with the HMOs. Any thoughts or resources that I can turn to? I am in Wisconsin.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t specifically have the answer to this question but I’m a cash based PT in Neenah, WI and would suggest checking with APTA WI. The state conference is coming up in two weeks and may be a good opportunity to ask questions! It looks like we also have some mutual contacts if you’d like to connect as Fox Valley providers!

> **Response 2:** You cannot charge Medicaid patients cash for Medicaid covered services, in any state.

I’m considering switching from OP to HH to have more time to work on my side gig. 

I’m wondering if there is anyone else that took this route and have any tips or advice on taking this path

Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is the side gig in healthcare? How much actual extra time are you needing? I wasn’t attempting to grow a side gig when I tried HH from OP but I fell for the “much more free time” or “schedule your time off”. I just found myself either making up for that time off on another day & as far as free time I found myself working way more from home on documenting then I wanted. & then making calls & scheduling is a whole other headache. Not trying to discourage you just giving my experience on trying HH 😅..I lasted two months then went back to OP

> **Response 2:** I was OP, then had a baby and switched to HH 2 decades ago. Last year I went back to OP, but may eventually wander back into HH for the flexibility and money. I wanted a mental challenge by going back to OP (boy, did I get one!) but also was missing camaraderie as HH is very isolating. OP these days is so much more of a grind, and everyone is so stressed. Our clinic has staggered lunches so fun interactions are minimal. HH can be overwhelming (as any new setting would be), but being one on one is such a blessing. Just know that motivation to improve is often much less in HH; many of those folks are fine to be completely sedentary and never perform an HEP, as long as they can make it from the recliner/bed to the toilet/bsc. Good luck! There are definitely advantages to both settings!

Good afternoon! A couple of questions for your minds:

1) Suggestions for income streams while a person builds their mobile practice and gets it running? My concern is that with a full-time job it would be hard to find “normal” days/hours for the new business. At the same time, I have a family to help support. Any thoughts on working home health full- or part-time? I’m coming from years in outpatient ortho. 

2) For those who have gone through the Uncaged program to help build and launch, what helped you decide to go this route vs other programs? I can think of three other programs/coaches, and am definitely a “paralysis by analysis” type.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Happy to have a call with you to talk about how UNCAGED CLINICIAN can help you. No hard selling or pressure

> **Response 2:** I really felt like the Uncaged program gave me exactly what I needed to understand and be effective in marketing.  I am not a paralysis by analysis type, I like to jump in and experience things.  But it really gave me the foundation to build my business and to feel like I can go forth and do anything.  The guys are all really great and you couldn't find more trustworthy people to work with

After years of trying to DIY my KPI and create spreadsheets to magically forecast profit and asses impact of changes to my practice…it’s come to my attention that there are business intelligence softwares that do this for you #MindBlown … I’m just starting the 10,000 Small Business Program through Goldman Sachs and they have a list of softwares to check out, but none seem particularly health care focused.

What is the best way to have a business phone number for small cash LLC? Looks like to use Google Voice you have to also have Google Workspace? I’d prefer not to have my personal number be used for business.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve found it to be a second SIM card into your phone, typically an eSIM. I can swap between lines as needed and set specific lines for specific numbers. (In my case an iPhone, but similarly with androids)

As a bonus, all of a sudden, your phone and related expenses becoming partial tax write off. ￼

> **Response 2:** I went as cheap as possible as my cash pay LLC is only my part time 5-12 clients a week, without plans to expand. 
I picked tracfone as a sim. For only call and text. So unfortunately texts are green but it gets the job done for only $135-150 a year. 
As long as you can transfer  number to another carrier if you need to expand it was the cheapest option I found. 

Tip: some of these pay as you go ones are only available as your primary line (I forgot the name eim1). So on my iPhone I had to put tracfone on eim 1 and then Tmobile on the second one. 
But that doesn’t make a difference since you can label them

I finally created my first (in a long time) strength program for a friend, only have a month written so far, but will be programming 16 weeks in prep for the mountain bike season come April. 

What do you recommend I charge for writing programs?  It took me a while to build the template on Google sheets, but now that I have one, it shouldn’t be too hard to modify for future clients.  I’ll also be putting programs together on an online app, which seems to be more tedious. 

Any recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have you tried final surge?  It's an app one of my old triathlon coaches used (I preferred it over training peaks). But, he used to do old school excel sheets and it drove me nuts.  At any rate, my last coach charged about 215 a month, but we talked constantly.

> **Response 2:** Depends on how much communication you have with them. Are you just writing a program and then giving it to them and that’s it? 

Are you communicating with them on a regular basis to answer questions or to update the program based on their feedback?

Google sheets was the most time consuming way for me to program for sure. Apps tend to make it easier for tracking, feedback, messaging, etc.

My dream is to start a mobile fitness studio. I currently practice as a pelvic health PT full-time and envision this mobile studio hosting pop-up group fitness classes at different locations in the community and potentially expanding to an online platform. I have taught group fitness classes in the past and have a couple group fitness certifications along with Sarah Duvall’s PCES. I am wondering about and seeking advice on legal things to get this rolling- LLC, liability insurance, waivers, etc. I appreciate any advice anyone has to offer!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Call the insurance company for sure- I’ve done retreats for example and needed a rider to add locations. Some insurance companies only cover the live class, not the recording or pre-recorded content. Ask a few companies lots of questions about what you would be covered for traveling and online. I highly recommend a lawyer to either create or review your waivers. But it is what you are covered for that will really come down to the wire if something happens. LLC you can set up or have your CPA take care of. If it is your dream, you’ll find the pieces and put it together:) Best of luck to you!

Have a patient with MS who is needing it for maintenance. She has Medicare part B. Can she continuously come throughout the year without taking breaks? I know maintenance is covered, but I still feel that coming to PT all year might cause some issues.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have had a few MS patients come continuing for several years. We just document that it is medically necessary for them to be able to maintain their independence in ADLs

> **Response 2:** I always question indefinite maintenance. Why can't you teach them a strong maintenance HEP and indications for returning to PT? In my opinion maintenance PT ought to be an intermittent service for 90% of cases. Wellness/private pay between episodes of maintenance if patient desires.

Hi all—looking for some opinions and also suggestions on where else I might post this.

I have a patient who’s a professional dancer and stilt walker. She’s quite hypermobile and recently ruptured her ACL, along with sustaining some medial meniscus injury.

She’s received two surgical opinions: one recommends a cadaver graft, while the other recommends using her hamstring. She personally prefers the surgeon who suggested the hamstring graft. He mentioned that although he often uses patellar tendon grafts for his football players, he feels that a hamstring graft may be more appropriate given her background in dance.

Would love to hear your thoughts or clinical experience on graft selection for hypermobile, high-level performers.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not a dancer, but an athlete (marathon runner and equestrian primarily) and I have 2 grafts from separate surgeries/surgeons. Both were done as cadaver grafts as the surgeons, who were both board certified sports med docs, stated they won’t do autografts on athletes with known hyper mobility due to the high failure rate. I had chronic dislocations prior to surgery and have had a few instances where I definitely would have dislocated had the graft not “caught.” Super painful still, but everything stayed where it belongs lol. Hope that helps.

OK safety question here for mobile therapists...

When I worked in home health, my home office knew my patient caseload for the day and had all addresses.  So if something happened,  not that anything ever did, someone would at least know my itinerary.  Now that I'm on my own, what are HIPAA compliant ways of CYA for safety purposes?  I do not have an admin person, it's just me.  Obviously I screen potential clients via phone, but the only thing that I can think of for itinerary is having Google 360 on my phone so someone knows where I am. Any other safety tips?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A few thoughts:

-Only reason I have an Apple Watch is for emergencies.  Can call or quickly do an SOS

-there are apps that you can hold down a button and if you release it then it calls for help and sends your location, I forget what it is called

-location available for emergency like others said

-I have a Birdie for alarm that I keep on me to bring attention if needed

-if it’s a “weird” situation, text someone what time you will be out of the visit and if they don’t hear from you after so much time, have them call you, etc

Listen to your gut!

I’ve been in some not so good situations at homes and whew, not fun!

> **Response 2:** You could always pay (even just a dollar) someone to be your security help/employee. That would cover the HIPAA aspect. Safety and common sense first!

Hello! I am an occupational therapist who lives in Southwest Florida. I am looking at starting my own private, swimming lessons company. I would like to have it out of my home pool. I would like to advertise that I am an occupational therapist and am starting the Angelfish swim school which is created for therapists. ￼ apparently, I also have to have an additional certification through the state of Florida by approved providers.  My question is it has anyone done a business like this? Am I putting my OT license at risk in any w￼ay by saying I am an occupational therapist? I will have insurance and a liability waiver created. (Tips on this would be appreciated also). It will be cash pay. I am looking to serve children of all abilities, but also want to emphasize ￼ my occupational therapy background ￼ because my approach will be sensory based.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in a moms group in Gainesville and people are constantly looking for swimming lessons for their kiddos. I’m sure this venture will be a success!

> **Response 2:** Having a waiver saying the client know they are not receiving OT services is good but if anything happens, you are always held to your highest license so just make sure whatever you are doing is still within your practice act

Thanks for the add to the group. Very enlightening thus far as I read through the older posts.

Does anyone run a mobile practice in an area that is heavy with Medicare beneficiaries? That is the make up of my region so going full cash mobile practice is a bit of a concern for me having to immediately know I can’t treat this high % of the population around me. I feel like I would need to accept MC to make it work.

Any advice is much appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

So I’m new here. Mostly just read what everyone has to say. But I’m trying to become Uncaged and I was wondering if anyone here has experience with having a clinic space in your home or in a shed type building in the back yard. I don’t really have the space in my home but I’ve thought about the possibility of having a shed type building finished out in my back yard for a clinic space. It is just me and I think ultimately it would be a lot cheaper than commercial rent. I’m planning to start mobile whenever I find my first clients until I gain some momentum and then transition to a brick and mortar clinic. Any considerations with having a clinic out of your home/personal property? Anyone who has done this or thought about it and decided against it and why? Anyone who has done it and loved it? Legally what kind of hoops are there to jump through as well as does it change anything with insurance (homeowners vs business)? Basically I’m just trying to decide if this is a viable option or if I should bite the bullet and rent a space. I welcome any and all feedback at this point.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m about to open my business from my home in about a month. I was a little nervous about clients knowing where I live but at this point I don’t really have the option to rent out space. Eventually, if I generate enough business, I’d love to rent out space……I’m researching the whole insurance thing right now…I’ll let you know how it goes. 😬

> **Response 2:** I know there are laws about dimensions   In Illinois only 10x10 is allowed to not be taxed. Then what to do about a bathroom etc. would be tough to insure

> **Response 1:** A lot of great ones! I can help with pain and optimizing movement potential at MyPotential Life & Body in North Raleigh.  

Stephanie Brunner at Venture Physical Therapy closer to city center seems good.  

Liz Adora Waddell is incredible at Art of Movement in Cary. 

Blaire Watson is also in Cary/Raleigh.

The team at balance physical therapy is also strong! 

What is the clients need?

> **Response 2:** Stephanie Brunner at Venture Physical Therapy

Are Bachelor’s Degree PT’s being phased out regarding larger company hospital supervisory roles? The goal is to have our business anyway but this is what I am noticing.
Clarifying: in hospital settings with job openings  In SNF, yes Bachelors will still continue.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Because I see you mentioned this question is in regards to job postings, the answer is no. Experience is important. Candidates are usually encouraged to apply regardless of the degree. If they have a license in goos standing and the experience for the role, then the individual is a good candidate. 

For teaching related roles, without other certifications and/or degrees, then it may be more challenging to obtain.

> **Response 2:** I had Bachelor in Physiotherapy…
I was Director of Rehab for Long Beach Nurisng and Rehab in New York

Anyone have treated pts with POTS  I have limited experience but want to help this patient and her MD both suffer from this. Or if you can point me to go links or educational places to learn to effectively treat this better.  Thanks very much

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A PT with POTs here, I've used the Modified CHOP protocol with success for myself, but I wasn't already super deconditioned. 

For my patients, the protocol is often too much too soon for them, but your goals are to stay below manageable levels of symptoms and ideally build strength/cardio in semireclined or reclined positions before standing. 

Also fyi: exercise often can decrease the amount of heart rate increase with activity, and increases a person's capacity, but many will still have symptoms right when they stand, or if they have to stand still (store checkout lines still luck for me)

> **Response 2:** I have treated a patient with EDS & POTS it was a very slow transition over the course of weeks and tolerance varied each visit. We started mostly in hooklying-> slightly elevated-> perched at edge of table progressing to standing next to table with frequent rests, checking BP and she increased tolerance to recumbent bike.
The EDS website has lots of great information on POTS as well.

I got an inquiry from a high level triathlete who is dealing with chronic right glute atrophy and reciprocal inhibition following sacral and pelvic fractures last year. He has worked with several PT’s with little to no improvement.

Anyone have experience with this who wouldn’t mind sharing some insight? Thanks!

Does anyone have any experience hiring someone on a work visa? I have an offer I'd like to extend to a therapist, but need to be able to take over her green card/labor certification process. I'm assuming I'd need a lawyer for support, but looking for some direction if anyone has any experience?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Musillo Unkenholt..based in Ohio..My previous employer used them. You need to show proof of ability to pay as a company for green card process.

> **Response 2:** Being one of irk visa for more than 10 years before becoming a permanent resident , I can tell you that it’s worth sponsoring for the visa as far as employee retention. Generally they don’t hop jobs easily. Yeah it comes with a price tag but in the long run you won’t repent it. 
I used the law firm mentioned here from ohio as well. And I like them very much

I am thinking about setting a booth up at a local festival in our very small mountain town. It's only $50 and the audience for the festival includes my target audience (adults and geriatrics). It's a 10x10 space. I am a mobile outpatient OT practice. I don't want to spend a ton of money on swag and banners. I was thinking about doing fall screenings and offering to check vitals to get foot traffic. I have business cards and trifolds that I can set out. If you've done events like this, what do you think is absolutely necessary? Any other ideas to gain the attention of folks?

ETA: I am in a community that struggles to get providers to come to it because it is up a mountain pass, about 30-45 minutes from the closest city. As of right now, I would be the only "vendor" of my type.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** DO IT!  Great way to get out there to see what works and doesn't! Communication and building a rapport/relationship with the people you meet is priceless!     GOOD LUCK!  Keep us posted on how it goes!

> **Response 2:** You’ll have a great time doing this! I’ve done several and always thoroughly enjoy it. 
From my experience, I would suggest blood pressure checks…they are quick & open the door for an opportunity to talk more about your services. Sometimes several people are waiting to be checked or to talk, and I’ve never felt like I had time to do a fall screen. 
I also like to have something interesting on my table…a few different styles of reachers, pictures of accessible modifications I’ve done, etc. Oh, and maybe a bowl of candy with a sugar free option.
My rack cards & business cards usually are scooped up. And I use my business card to write their BP on & give to them! 
I’ve also made a few checklists…one for dementia, one for falls, and an info sheet that explains mobile OT. 
Oh, a clipboard with a signup sheet…capture their email, phone, mailing address…and offer a drawing for something…a gift card or something simple you can mail them. I’ve found that leaving an empty space at the end of each line allows me to make notes about info they may have asked about. I use this for a f/u conversation. 
Just enjoy yourself! Your happy energy will be the best thing to sell your services!

# *Investment vs. Expense*
## ***6 questions to ask yourself!***

*Starting and growing a business can often feel like a financial strain.*

*How we approach the way in which we look at the purpose of the money being spent from a mindset point can change everything for us.*

*It is pretty well understood what expenses are.*

*In short, an expense is something that costs you money without the opportunity for further growth or time freedom.*

*Investments are when the money spent towards a thing, a service, or even an employee is going to reward us and/or the practice on the backend.*

*In essence, it gives us our time back and/or makes us/the business money.*

*When money is on the table, or being considered, a great question to start with is: Will this (thing putting the money towards) impact our business in a significant way to where we can afford NOT to do it?*

*So often, the first question is can we afford it?  That question can be detrimental because this is attacking it just like you would an expense.*

*There are 5 more questions to ask that will help you to decide if the money potentially being spent is an investment or an expense.*

*Will this give us the ability to serve our customers better? Yes or No?*

*Will it improve my/our ability and knowledge of growing and running the business?*

*Will it help free up more time for me/my employees?*

*Will it make a difference in how satisfied our customers are?*

*Will it help to differentiate me/my practice in the market, and make me/the practice more different than I/it already am/is?*

*Answering “Yes” to any of these questions is a good indicator that the money is going to help make the business better for (us) and for (our) customers.*

*When we immediately write off things (say “No”) because it doesn’t fit in the budget, then we are approaching them with an expense mindset.*

*Send me a DM if you are ready to invest in yourself!*

Struggling on this end.  Paralyzed by self-consciousness, fear of failure and fear of the unknown.  Major imposter syndrome.  Also sucks having no direct connections to rely on for legal, billing, entrepreneurship advice.  Having made some bad decisions on expenses already making it difficult to move forward.  Just want some small successes to help move along but mentally realizing all the things I need to do… overwhelming as hell.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely not alone in that feeling. I’d say the vast majority of people here have had days, weeks, months like that. Just keep going. From what I’ve seen, people in this group are a good resource.

> **Response 2:** I feel like I could have wrote this. Reach out if you wanted to talk. I’m opening as well. You’re not alone, mistakes are made by everyone. This has been done by many before us and if they did it we can do it. Scratch and claw until we climb out of that whole. Find someone to talk with. This is a very lonely road in the beginning and it can be daunting.  I’m there with you.

Any recommendations for good night splint for plantar fasciitis that you have used or recommended to patients. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I once showed a photo in another PT-related FB group (back in 2018) of a very simple kinesiotape technique that I have used with clients dealing with plantar fasciitis.  I always had clients report that it helped tremendously.  In fact, with the photo I stated that I used it with a current client and that both he and his wife reported that he slept the best he had in many nights; and with very very little pain.  I got LAMBASTED in this group for making such "ridiculous" claims. 🤣  But, if you want to know, I have always used a simple "navicular sling" technique with kinesiotape.  Even personally, I have found it to help with pain at night/pain first thing in the morning.

> **Response 2:** i just went through looking for my patient when the DPM recommended a cheap ACE; he said the expensive ones that pull a lot end up not being used with poor compliance; so he gave her the choice to buy a less expensive one to see if she could adapt at night; so far so good; you need to be able to safely walk to the bathroom without having to take it off; so consider age and strength

**Community Responses:**

There are occasionally failures to send in there due to connection issues but that’s standard with any fax system and it doesn’t happen often.

Curious how you navigate phone conversations with potential new patients who monopolize the conversation and a lot of your time. Then ask you questions like “how long have you been doing this?”, ”do you have your doctorate?”, “can I have a link to your bio” etc etc. At the end of that convo I really don’t think it’s with my energy 😖 just venting but also curious!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When you start a call always state an end time.  “I’m so glad to connect with you.  I have 10 minutes before my next client….”

> **Response 2:** Maybe start the call with a snapshot of your business - something like “hi- thanks for taking a minute to talk with me.  I love getting to know a bit more about new patients before they come in to make sure that it’s going to be a good fit for both of us. Let me tell you a little bit about me: i’ve been in practice for over ___ years. I focus on _____, and unlike many facilities around you’ll get all an hour of my time at every appointment.  Can you tell me more about your injury?“. And then if they are still asking questions and not getting an appointment booked kindly say “I’m sorry, I have a patient coming in and I’ll need to get off the phone shortly. I’d love to answer any other questions you have - why don’t you email me your questions and we can set up a follow up call tomorrow“

Question- 
how does one’s practice affiliate with Amazon and such other vendors for patients to buy products off their website via an affiliate link for a commission? Many of my patients buy their PT products from various online sites (mainly amazon) that I recommend them and wonder, if there’s a way I can incorporate this as a small part of my practice? 
Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would love to know the answer to this too! My patients always ask if I have an Amazon storefront

Best advice for soccer cleat fitting? Any key points? Patient with plantar fasciitis.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don't go cheap. There are literally zero support in those. Some of the higher end shoes have much better support on the bottom and in the inserts.

> **Response 2:** The stud pattern can make a big difference. Soft ground for wet fields, AG or round studs for turf. 

If they need wide fit, new balance usually has more options. Every brand will have several models that fit differently. Some insoles are really cheaply designed even on the high end cleats.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Truth. Our IT company sent emails out on Friday and have blocked the site for now. We started using TheraXPro

I'm considering red light therapy to add to my wellness business.  I currently have limited space due to the business being part time while working for a physician group.  I would like to use for multiple types of conditions.  Also, considering  esthetics in regards to anti-aging. There are numerous at home FDA approved devices and medical units as well. 
What has been successful in your clinics or mobile practices?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t find red light is a big money maker… more of an add on. Red light units aren’t that expensive and are best for regular use so most people will just purchase on their own. I have patients try it in session and then I recommend one for them to purchase

> **Response 2:** Following because I just got one that is somewhat new technology and can let you know how it goes once I actually get it set up and implemented. I'm going to have the same space problem so hopefully it'll work out till my least is up in May

Just sharing a feel-good story, because it made me think of this group!

My daughter (1st grade) gave her first class presentation this morning, and parents got to go watch. She presented on the Barn own and made a 3-D model to go along with the presentation. She did GREAT - but the best part was, after her presentation, the teacher asked for Compliments and Questions. A few kids asked questions, but pretty much every kid in the class raised their hand to give her a compliment - on her model, her presentation, her performance. 
It was SO COOL seeing these kids lift her up - she's normally very quiet in school, so this was a big deal for her to use her voice in front of the whole class. 
One older girl even told her 'You should be an entrepreneur'!  
Huge realization for me - how important it is for us to recognize our peers who are putting themselves out there, to acknowledge their efforts not just when they meet the greatest goals, but just the showing up! And to encourage each other!
It made me think of this awesome UC FB Group! - just wanted to say Great Job, You've Got This, I see you and you're killing it! to all of us putting in the grind every day, and especially those of us who are newer to entrepreneurship and just finding our voices!

Hey y’all quick question! I’m in the VERY beginnings of a mobile OP and wellness clinic. I’m in Texas so for PT I will need to obtain MD orders within 10 days. How do y’all go about this? Do you actually get a fax so it can be easier sent? And so you can fax documents to MD’s? I’ll be enrolling with Medicare so wondering if it’s needed. 

Also, am I allowed to charge a travel fee for Medicare patients? Or should I keep my territory for Medicare smaller? Thanks y’all! Figuring out overhead costs and territories right now.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same boat as you… plan to start with Google Workspace templates until I get Medicare figured out… would love to get rolling with Ray Berardinelli’s system!

> **Response 2:** Most of Mars have faxing built in.  The best ones have POC tracking in place to help you manage it all.

Hi Uncaged friends! Does anyone have a "business operations manager" on staff who handles things like benefits verification, claims submission, faxing/communicating with PCP offices, managing incoming leads/referrals, and invoicing clients? If so, could you elaborate on your pay structure and hours/week for this type of position? Thanks in advance :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did! (Our clinic is bigger now, so we now have a full time office coordinator who comes in person).

I just paid her hourly, and she averaged about 20-25 hours per week 😊

> **Response 2:** 20 hours a week flat pay, if she gets all the work done in under 20 hours, same pay. Slightly over 20 hours, same pay. If she continually trends over 20 hours, then we’ll bump her hours up!

Would you like to know the secret to how people are getting ahead by making more money?

It comes down to how many hours they are working.

It's easy to think that wealthier people work crazy hours - more than we may want to do ourselves.

However, this isn't necessarily the truth.

One of the primary factors is that "richer" people have figured out how to "work" 24/7 instead of 40 hours/week.

In other words, they have created ways to make money while they sleep.

And they still aren't putting any more "man hours" into the week than you or I.

Want to learn ways to create this for yourself?

Our mentor, Greg Todd, will be hosting a FREE 5 day Challenge this coming week on **Building Invincible Income Streams**.

And we want to invite you to take advantage of his expertise!

It all starts Monday, March 6th.

***It's FREE to register!  The link is in the comments below.***

Why are we inviting you to this incredible challenge?

Because...

Your Success is our success!

The UNCAGED team.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had my own practice for 50 years and all of a sudden I began working 40 hours a week and thought I was on vacation so if you wanna create something, you gotta put the effort and the hours in.

> **Response 2:** Will the videos be recorded/ viewable if I’m not available at the live times?

Can a speech therapist provide private speech services in a private school? More specifically, a private therapist going into a private school to provide speech services to students, paid directly by the students’ parents. Not contracting to be paid by the school.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Can you come to our private school? 😂 just kidding. 

Our school has a few different private pay “specialists” and I wish it was SLP/OT instead.

> **Response 2:** Yes, I just started to do this. I was getting so many requests and just decided to give it a try because I only treat clients during my daughter’s school hours. You’ll need permission from school admin. I work with teacher to determine schedule  that is least impactful to academic needs within my available time frame.

I feel like it’s time to venture out on my own, but I think I might need some help getting started and deciding which business model (OON, cash only, insurance INN) will be best. Please help

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Reimbursement is too low with INN to be worth your time as a solo provider.  Reserve those in network rates for high volume clinics.  Cash only leaves money on the table in my experience.  Learning how to submit OON claims is the best of both worlds in my opinion.  You are reimbursed significantly higher than INN in many cases AND the patient gets to use their insurance (if they have OON benefits).

Does Anyone know a better way to find physical therapists other than Indeed? I am hiring but not getting any hits on indeed ?! TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use indeed and have good luck when I search resumes and reach out directly to a candidate (rather than wait for therapists to apply). I filter for therapists a who have been active on indeed within the past 30 days or have recently updated their resume because I assume they are maybe looking around for a job and I can highlight my open position to them:)

> **Response 2:** Same!!!!

Hi everyone, I plan on starting my own private practice in Florida geared towards working with golfers. I plan on being strictly cash based. I was wondering what is the best way to navigate Medicare patients if I don’t plan on taking insurance. Also, what is the best way to navigate Florida’s direct access laws given that we only have 30 days to treat before needing a prescription. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am an SLP and I called Medicare I’m in Florida they told me that if someone wants to use me privately then they can pay me privately and there is. Nothing for me to be aware of regarding laws or a script 
If someone is foregoing using Medicare I was told that I can see them for any type of service under my scope without  needing a script or anything else 
Is this different for PT?

Hey everybody! I am starting my own cash clinic in July. Will be primarily treating baseball players. Subleasing from an indoor baseball facility and fronting cost for outfitting the space with equipment. Currently looking for a business coach and would love any recommendations. I know we are in the Uncaged group so Im sure there are plenty that have done theirs. I just had a call with PTBIZ and loved what I heard but quite expensive. Any experience and thoughts welcomed! Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Awesome.. where are you located? Always looking for my son who is a baseball player! David Bayliff and his crew will be your best bet for coaching. A good coach and program is priceless!

For a while we had more people needing help in that group than professional caregivers. I think therapists are finding out we're perfect for this.

Good morning y’all! Just a question. I’m a member of a chamber of commerce. I am considering not renewing this year, but curious if someone has a different perspective for me on that to change my mind. I’ve been a member one year. I have participated in events and committees in the first quarter last year, but slowly became too busy to do so with working hours. I didn’t receive any leads last year, including when providing resources and fun at one of the health fairs (good turnout). I think the ROI is important, or lack there of. I also consider if I need to figure out more effort on my part to create ROI there. I’d like to save the funds for other business needs, if ROI not likely. Do other members of chambers have good success with leads? I’d like to donate my time and fee even without ROI, but our numbers are a bit tight.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ROI was not good for me. Local networking groups were better and easier to get to and easier to get to know people.

> **Response 2:** Great question and I think it’s important to know that what you’re experiencing is completely normal. Congrats! You’re getting busy..

My opinion, for what it’s worth, is to really start to audit what you’re spending your time on in your business. What can be delegated or what should you start planning to delegate in the future etc. 

Because nobody wins when the owner is crazy busy. It’s a very slippery slope so being proactive about protecting your time is really important. 

Because maintaining and nurturing high leverage relationships (IE: chamber) is the job of the CEO. And the CEO hat is usually the first thing that gets swept under the rug when “urgent” things start piling up. 

Hope that helps!!

Hello, my friend who is a female in her 30s had a stroke. She's located in Dallas and we are trying to find her the best inpatient rehab facility possible in Dallas or Houston to regain as much motor function as possible. Please advise. I'm an outpatient PT and am only familiar with TIRR in Houston. I am grateful for any facility recommendations or PT/OT connections in these cities.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BIR Dallas (Baylor institute for Rehab) for IP in Dallas
Just my two cents but if she lives in Dallas…I would stay in Dallas for many reasons.  While TIRR is awesome, that’s a lot to transport someone all that way and then also friends and family not being there.  BIR is a great facility.  
Pate has an awesome day neuro program but that would only be appropriate once she’s able to be at home.

> **Response 2:** Accel rehab in Carrollton/Plano

Looking for some guidance. I have a client who complains of "dizziness" only with bending forward to pick items up off the floor. She reports double vision with looking all the way left or all the way right, like in the peripheral vision. She has Graves with some eye protrusion and a history of a MVA 20 years ago but was dealing with multiple fractures and surgeries so she isn't sure if she had a concussion or other head trauma but doesn't recall being told about any head trauma. I was not able to elicit nystagmus with roll test or dix hall-pike. Eye gaze appeared WNL. Neck ROM WNL. I gave some habituation exercises but feel like I am missing something. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In terms of eyes: Graves Disease can lead to double vision due to scar tissue shortening an ocular muscle. Check and see if with monocular (one eye only) viewing that the double vision is improved. Would recommend ophthalmologist vs. neuro-ophthalmologist.

Did you perform ligamentous testing, or vertebral artery screen? How are smooth pursuits/saccades? Can look at smooth pursuit neck torsion test to rule in cervicogenic component. If there is laxity in ligamentous testing, may want to see about flexion/extension XRay for cervical instability. Cervical impairments/instability can of course lead to double vision, but also degradation in smooth pursuit especially. 

Also assessing in general her balance, sensory integration (CTSIB), to see how that fits in the picture.   Happy to help however I can 😊

> **Response 2:** Not sure about the double vision part.. But with multiple facial fractures, I am thinking possibly sinusitis. Only thing that made me think that was I recently had sinusitis and bending over made me feel extremely dizzy that I almost fell over. Another symptom was that I would tap/gently hit my head and literally felt like I was getting concussed bc i was so dizzy from each hit (I was light sparring, that's why my head was getting hit lol). I also had a headache. I did sinus massage and it's insane bc I could feel it draining from my sinuses. I YouTubed a bunch of stuff and then I had a friend do a sinus massage too. Anyways, just a thought!

(Edited to add that I realized you just said fractures, not specifically facial fractures. Oops!)

I am looking to possibly hire someone to lead various exercise classes. I am mobile, so the classes will be outside in a public park (there are SOOO many around here). 

I'm assuming I would pay the instructor as a contractor correct? Do I need them to sign a contract of any sort? If so, does anyone have an example of one I could use?

Also, how much cut should I give the instructor? 

Is there any other advice I should know about?

Thank you!

Hi all! I run a mobile pediatric practice and usually I see them in their homes but I have a parent asking if I could see their child at their school after they are done? I still have to ask how that would work if school is out but is this something I’m even allowed to do? I’m afraid to run into issues with the district and whatnot

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** School most likely won’t allow due to liability. I’d have parent contact the school to let them deal with it and save you time. Schools typically already have OT’s and PT’s that work for the district.

> **Response 2:** When I did home health pediatrics, I used to go in to the school after hours if they were at an after hours program or if their parent was a teacher. Should be fine! Just have to check in with whoever is watching them

Has anyone who has seen patients through Luna PT stopped working with them? Just wondering what steps I need to take (if any). Already turned off the “auto-accept new patients” feature. I plan to finish out current patients POC, but not take any new ones. Any responsibility to let current patients know I won’t be working with Luna in the future?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They reached out to me after a couple of months of not seeing patients and asked me to fill out a form that had a date of return to the platform. I ignored it because I didn’t have a date and they just sent an email telling me that they deactivated my account and if I wanted to treat again, to just reach out.

> **Response 2:** They'll kick you out as soon as it is time to get a certification or renew your license and you don't update them. Even though they pretend they aren't a PT company they are and the compliance stuff is tracked no different than a hospital or any facility that bills Medicare.

Hi there!

Shockwave practitioners: Is shockwave therapy painful?

I've never heard that it was painful before until recently but am wondering if perhaps she has a lower threshold for pain stimulus or if perhaps the clinician was more aggressive.
She asked if it would help to do in conjunction with PT as I don't provide it but do other manual therapy interventions. 
We are working on bilateral Achilles tendinitis.

Thank you in advance!
Amanda

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The research that I’ve learned from a lot of key opinion leaders is that you should be around a 4 out of 10 subjective feeling of “intensity” as I like to call it. We tell our patients it shouldn’t be painful, but it’s not sensation free.

> **Response 2:** I noticed it’s more uncomfortable around areas that are problematic. I always test things on myself before the client and I was not feeling any discomfort then I put it on my client and realized we had to adjust the settings.

Question for the hive mind: 
I have a small, 17 year old, cheerleader that I am seeing for left scapular pain. I tired putting her in a massage chair to best access the area for trigger point release but both times that I have tired this, about 10 mins into the TPR, she gets dizzy, pale, sweaty, his vision and hearing disturbances, and nearly passes out. Once she’s out of the position, it all resolves in about 3 to 4 mins. 
When I treat her in prone on the mat, she’s totally fine. I have treated her with TPR MANY times over the years without issue, mostly the back but sometimes her scapular area- but never in the massage chair. That is the new element. 

She is small to when I do the TPR, she moves and potentially goes into cervical extension or possibly a forward head position- this is from my memory so I’m not quite sure… has anyone heard of this?  It seems like a vasovagal syncope but has anyone heard of someone having a vasovagal dependent on cervical position???
Any other ideas???

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d do a vertebral artery test.

> **Response 2:** What do her reflexes look like? Special reflexes? I agree she should be screened for cci, chiari, screen for hEDS, just realize these things rarely show up on supine mri. It’s so important to know what her neuro screen looks like!

Looking for some success stories regarding conservative management of a Baker's cyst. 
Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Come on you guys. Baker cyst is a reservoir where the swelling accumulates because there's nowhere for it to go. It is likely from a torn meniscus or damage to the cartilage. Strengthen the knee and create an environment for healing and the baker cyst will abate when the swelling resolves.

> **Response 2:** I have seen many a baker's cyst disappear with making sure soft tissue friction is off the back of the knee. Addressing hamstrings gastrocs, popliteus, IT band, joint compression and definitely balance of the pelvis!

Hey Friends! Got my mobile cash business all set up and rolling and need a little input. Most of my clients are runners and cyclists, and I have quickly been approached by a local Triathlon team (100ish members) about becoming a partner with them as their “team PT”. It’s a super awesome opportunity, but has anyone done this before? Curious if you recommend any contracts or anything. Plan is to just offer a team discount for services to improve quantity of business and overall networking. Not 100% sure on numbers yet, but curious if anyone has input.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You could do a contract.  But, honestly, focus on building the relationship built on mutual trust and shared goals.  This will be a more authentic and fruitful partnership

> **Response 2:** I think the fair trade is discount for exclusivity. They would have to commit to that as a team then you'd have a deal if I were you

Reason #1154 of why I love working for myself and providing quality care and avoiding a big hospital…

After my client with Parkinson’s has been hospitalized for over a week with limited PT due to “short staffed”, the family paid me cash to come and get her sitting at EOB to finally get her in a position other than supine. 

Checking in at the hospital entrance for Covid screening consisting of a question, “Do you have any Covid symptoms?” was none other than… a Doctorate of Physical Therapy. 

I can’t imagine being part of a system that prioritizes physical therapists covering the check in desk over providing crucial healthcare services for which we have doctorate level education. I can’t imagine seeing a physician covering that desk. 

To top it off, they refuse to allow me to transfer into her power chair for prolonged sitting after I leave because of the liability of transferring her back to bed. 

Thank you to this group and its leaders for showing a better way forward. Change can happen. Keep pushing!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If this were my hospital, it would have been an OP therapist who refuses to do any acute care, but was flexed in the OP clinic and wanted the hours.Not very professional of a DPT, right? Or the manager who allows this. True story.

> **Response 2:** When COVID hit my husband, a physician, was a great team member of the hospital staff at times helping with Cna coverage. He didn't not contribute to his healthcare team because of his degree. He went where he was needed. I own my own mobile therapy practice. I help my clients if they need help doing things above and beyond my therapy goals if they ask and it's reasonable. I don't say "well I have a masters degree so I'm over qualified to....."I can understand your post against a "big hospital" but there's always ways in helping out for the greater good.

International work question! My husband is US Army, and we just found out we're moving to Germany in a few months for the next 2-3 years. Does anyone have any experience with this? I won't be able to work off of the US post, to the best of my knowledge, as I will not be able to master German in time to procure a German license. I also am entertaining the idea of doing more of a cash pay service to create more flexibility to travel rather than working as a civilian on post (I Dry Needle and treat Pelvic Floor, as well as general ortho). I am just not even sure where to start to learn about the legality of all of this and wanted some insight if possible!

One of my favorite parts of the Uncaged Pathway and the leadership of Josh Payne, David Bayliff, and Kevin DeGroot is how they stress (and demonstrate) **serve first**.  I have taken this advice to heart and it has helped my business grow in completely unexpected ways!  If you have been on the fence about talking to one of them about joining the pathway, do it!  It might be the best step you take for your business 

Thanks for all of your amazing leadership gentlemen!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks for the kind words Reanna Aguirre!

> **Response 2:** I love seeing your mindset change to seeing the possibilities before you!! 
You are doing amazing!!!

Legal question based out of CA. I have a cash pay patient I saw previously for wellness (medicare). He recently fell and was admitted to the ICU and has since gone back onto HH PT with an alternative agency. The family would like us to continue with the wellness but I feel I’ll have a hard time not blurring the lines between PT and wellness. 

How can I best help this patient of mine while covering my own butt? They don’t want to switch off HH services and also want to supplement me into the home so he can receive care 4 days per week (two with me and two with HH) and avoid going to a SNF since he is no longer ambulatory.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If a HHPT is working with this patient for functional goal oriented tasks according to specific  diagnoses…..
and THEN you literally just “exercise all the muscle groups” without tasks/goals/education/“skilled” services, I FEEL like these can coexist….. 

***I’m answering from a logic standpoint vs a legal standpoint***
*****also I don’t practice in CA*****

And I’d prob consider having them sign something indicating that as a wellness provider, you will carry out the PT HEP/recommendations issued by the HHPT for the duration of the HH episode

> **Response 2:** I may be off base, however my understanding is that you can’t charge cash for a covered service. If Medicare is paying for home health already, you would not be a covered service at the same time and should be safe either way.

Hey everyone! 
I have a question about starting a health coaching side-hustle while I'm in PT school. I'm halfway through second year. Health education and promotion, lifestyle medicine, coaching, and exercise prescription are all things I'm interested in incorporating in how I practice as a PT post-graduation.

Advice, words of encouragement, and/or anything I should know about in terms of (1) creating a client experience (i.e. intake session, how many follow-up sessions, how should I facilitate communication between sessions, etc.), (2) marketing myself and intaking clients, and (3) making sure I'm staying within state law.

From what I've seen I can facilitate personal training and provide general advice about nutrition without any certification or license, and I have a BS in exercise science, so that covers any concerns about my own education. I'm willing to be corrected.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can do it . I was at sshc live and plenty of students were attending. Plenty are and have started their business before graduation.
Start with your systems , all the legal stuff , decide your niche and who you will serve and create a product.

> **Response 2:** Go for it. You’re “qualified “ enough to support people now, right?

What questions do you have?

Has anybody utilized a separate cell phone for their clinics/business? Considering getting a second so that I can still be connected when I'm out of the office while I'm starting out. I'm open to any ideas that you all have tried and like! thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I definitely do not recommend a separate cell phone. There are many alternatives where you can have an app right on your current phone. We use go high-level CRM system, and the phone is through that.

> **Response 2:** We do Goggle Voice and all my therapists have it on their phones to message clients.  I'm about to get a second iPhone so all my work apps are on that one and off my personal. I get so many work notifications that I miss important personal ones.

***I literally just had a conversation with a PT friend who is considering starting his own practice because of the direction that the traditional world is going.***

His main concern? 

He said: "I'm sure you hear this all the time: Can I do it? Will this work? I know it's just self doubt."

Truthfully, I - and we - DO get that question.

 *ALL THE TIME*.

Here was my response:

"You are wanting to perform a magic trick - build something from nothing - and you've never done a magic trick in your life.  So, you're wondering if it's really possible to pull a rabbit out of a hat."

He giggled and said: "You're right"

And, like most people, he was also concerned about being able to provide for his family sooner rather than later.

My question is this:

If you are wanting to do something you have never done before and your livelihood depended on it, wouldn't you feel better about the journey going with someone who has already done it?

***With hundreds of others?***

I know I would be.

Come, Launch with us.

I am working with an elderly gentleman who had a brain injury.  He is homebound and cared for by his elderly wife.  He spends lots of time in bed and often in a side lying position with his hips and knees flexed.  He also has developed high tone due to his injury. I'm afraid he's going to develop contractures (actually he already is).  Any ideas for something he can wear when sleeping to help combat the lower extremity flexion?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I worked in burn unit, sometimes we would make plastic splints but knowing you probably don’t have access to splinting materials, we also would use soft knee extension braces.

> **Response 2:** If he is bed bound  and already with hip knee ankle flexion contractures, the best thing he can do is stand up straight during the day. Weight bearing and walking is the best way to use gravity.  Stay out of bed during the day  and wear the softest night splints when he’s sleeping.  What do the OT and physiatrist think ?

Does anyone know if a referral from a chiropractor for physical therapy is ok after the 12 visits or 45 days, as per the direct access law in California??

Thank you.

We have been trying to become in network with BCBS since February of this year without any progress.  We filled out an online application back in February.  We have been getting very little feedback and have been unable to talk with anyone on the phone.  Does anyone have any recommendation for expediting this process?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I hope this makes sense bc I'm going to try to explain a process that made no damn sense.

I was told that my area wasn't accepting new providers. Now I only knew that bc I couldn't figure out the online application and I called for advice. 

Here was the advice. It worked, but Jesus it took forever.

Apply as a non participating provider. Just you. Not your company. 

You'll get accepted. 

Once you get accepted and wait a few weeks, say... January call back, tell them you'd like to request a contract bc you'd like be a participating provider. They'll tell you which application to complete. Apply as a SINGLE provider... Just you. 

Get a contract. Accept the terms. Sign your contract. 

Wait a little while and call back and say "I've hired more therapists and I need to have my company listed as a group provider, yes I'm already in your network." Credential your other providers, get new contact, viola! Merry Christmas 2023... You're fully in network.

😬

> **Response 2:** You should have a regional blue cross rep for your area.  They might be able to help you.  I found ours on their website.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hello dear fellow PT’s and businessowners!!
I have been a PT since last 13 years in United States. However due to restrictions on my Visa I could never own a business 😞 
To run my own clinic has been my dream ever since I graduated from school. I am finally at a point where I could start my own clinic (have authorization from Immigration) 
My Challenge - I feel I have lost my skill set especially manual therapy since I worked with geriatrics in the same setting (CCRC) last 13 years.
I feel I still have the passion in me but I’m very nervous to leave the comfort of a regular paycheck and also having less time with my 2 little kids. 
Thank you for the support and guidance from this group.

> **Response 2:** Hello everyone! I’m at the beginning of this journey and am excited. I am a physical therapist in NJ (central/northern) with orthopedic background and recently pursued a certification for pregnancy and postpartum exercise correction. I have registered my business and working through the preliminary legal and background items. I plan to be mobile until I can have a location. My biggest challenge right now is getting over my own fears and self- limitations. And also making sure I understand all the practice act and legal/business side of things so I’m completely covered. I’ve already learned so much from reading through some of the posts. So looking forward to all the knowledge I can gain from this group as well as offer anything I learn along the way.

I’ve been hesitant to share this but i want someone to feel inspired and get the drive that YOU CAN DO IT!! 
I am coming up on my 1 year anniversary of taking the leap of faith on quitting my very safe and steady job to pursue my dream of opening a brick and mortar practice of Grow With Me Pediatric Therapy LLC  Before I did this I listened to almost EVERY Uncaged podcast and had a brief talk with David Bayliff. I knew my area needed a pediatric practice, but man was the thought of me doing it scary and daunting. This group along with support from families and friends  gave me the motivation and determination that I could do it. Honestly, that 5 min talk with David was a huge boost for me. I’m so thankful for this group!! 
In 1 month we will have our first anniversary. We just won “Best in Bulverde for rehabilitative services” in my small town and my clinic is equipped with the best providers (5+)  I could dream of 🥹. 
It has grown faster than I could have imagined, the Lord is good y’all! 
I’m not going to lie, today I was in actual tears from the hard work - it is blood, sweat and tears. It is not easy but IT IS WORTH IT!  
I owe so much to this group, even from being behind the scenes and learning from everyone else. Read every post you can and listen to the insightful podcasts!
So if anything, take this post as your drive to DO THE HARD THINGS! 
Here was my motivational thought process the entire time: “my area needs it and someone is going to do it, so it better be ME!!”
Thank you Uncaged Clinician and David, I’m growing the dream!  💚

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Melissa! I am smiling so big for you right now!! So happy for you that you displayed the courage, the boldness, and grabbed hold of faith to do this!  And NOW look at you!! UNCAGED!!! AAAAANNNND winning "Best of" ... and to think that you doubted if you could even do this.  Bravo! BRAVO!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just signed up for 4 month trial on Wibbi today. I did the online demo and it seems very user friendly. I have been using HEP2go for years and recently tried TheraXpro since the issues with HEP2go started. TheraXpro is free and pretty easy to use but I wanted to try some other options out as well.

He is such a kind and selfless person. I checked in on him and he said despite everything that happened he considers himself lucky and wants to go out and help as soon as he can to help rebuild. This week has been so heavy. His words brought some light. But it’s still so difficult. So much devastation.  And also so much community. Thank you for the love and prayers. LA still needs it 💔♥️💗

Does anyone use medi share for themselves + spouse + kids and can share their experience?  I’ve requested info from the website and got some basic pricing but I’m looking for personal experience.  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** we have christian healthcare ministries and have been very pleased. Kid 1 born on traditional BCBS and was $6300 plus higher premiums. Kid  2 was born on CHM and we pay ~$700/month and our final OOP was $0. If you go this route I highly recommend looking at CHM gold plan + brother's keeper because it takes away your lifetime max.

> **Response 2:** I use it for myself and have for 6 years. Zero issues. Initially, we were all 5 on it until my husband switched jobs and it made more sense for him to switch. It works well if you do not have any pre-existing issues or do not need any mental health coverage (this includes seeing a counselor, anxiety, etc). Worth a try for sure

Forgive me is this has been asked before.. For Medicare patients, anyone ever have trouble getting PCP to sign POC if initial order doesn’t originate from them.. ie a family member wants them on  services.. and if so, how do you overcome this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve had doctors refuse to sign. Very very infrequently though and it’s mostly due to having previous bad experience like a lawsuit or something. If the doc doesnt sign within a week or two, i tell the patient and they are responsible for getting a doctor to sign it whether the Same doc or another. If the doc doesnt sign within 30 days, then I wouldn’t treat them until i get a signed POC. I’m in NJ though so definitely depends on where you are.

> **Response 2:** If Dr doesn’t agree then that is their call . Service must be medically necessary and not family decision.

For all my neuro PTs, I have a question. I have a patient that has muscular dystrophy. I normally don’t have pts with neuro diseases but the patient and her caregiver wanted to know if I had any recommendations for a standing transfer DME that would assist the pt and caregiver with being able to help with dressing and undressing that doesn’t block the legs. I’m not familiar with anything that doesn’t have some sort of bar or pad around the legs as the patient has no ability to stand on her own. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It maybe time for bed level dressing for both patient and caregiver safety? 

Otherwise insurance sommmeeeetimes (usually after an inpatient stay, but haven't tried from home rec) covers a SaraSteady - pt still needs trunk control, partial stand, and ability to weight shift. Has a knee block, but can don pants in sitting, assist to stand, pull wings under and either shimmy by leaning to get pants over hips or another partial rise to get pants over bottom. One of my fav pieces for toileting ease/safety too.

> **Response 2:** As weakness progresses, they will typically need a more dependent transfer system such  as a hoyer lift or something similar for transfers. As stated above, may be time to look at sitting or supine caregiver assisted dressing.

**Original Post:**
For those of you who practice in a gym setting and take Medicare - any guidance on answering the application question “is this private office space used exclusively for the applicant’s private practice?” 

Initially I answered no, and got my application back stating I had made a “typographical error” on that question. This was among other items that needed to be changed. Having a hard time getting a hold of the Novitas rep to ask the question. 

Details about my setup:

The treatment room I’m using is at the back of a local gym (you enter through the gym) and is also used as a dance or yoga studio, spin class at other times of day, but not when I’m there for business. No patient information stored there. 

I’m assuming that they’d flag it on the site visit if it doesn’t meet Medicare standards based on my application, and I wouldn’t find out much later that I’m in violation of any rules… but this is a fledgling practice and I’m quite risk averse in this arena.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** CMS Guidance on "exclusive use of space" is provided in the Code of Federal Regulations, and is cited in IOM 100-02, Ch. 15, §230.4.  

Space is referenced in CMS 855i (and PECOS) Section 2 (K).  "If you responded YES to questions 2, 3 or 4 above, you must have and attach a copy of any written agreement that gives you exclusive use of the office space for PT/OT services."

"Office" is therapy space... (don't confuse w/home or admin "office".  Office = Clinic in therapy parlance.

A therapy supplier is required to upload copy of the lease (contract) showing exclusive use of space... Given a supplier may only be using space on selected dates/times... lease must reflect the times/space that is exclusive use.

CMS has guidance in other therapy guidance for space (time/section); the OIG has provided official guidance on calculating space/time for purpose of amount $$.  (many steps prior to getting to FMV). 

#Risk needs to be mitigated on the application by understanding GoToTheSource rules...  

Glad to provide a quick tip to anyone needing it... not a solicitation for business

> **Response 2:** Nancy Beckley's Compliance Rules Will be correcting my answer posted below earlier.
------
Posted earlier: As long as you have exclusive use during your visits, you can check that box.

I have two questions. While my intention is to be cash based I feel that poor people in this country get the short end of the stick and curious about contracting with Medicaid. I'm curious about reimbursement. I looked up a fee schedule but I couldn't find PT on it. I am in PA. Can anyone in PA give me an idea of reimbursements? A range perhaps?
Secondly, I know we can't charge patients different fees but wondering if I called something a class and charged less, if that would be ok, even if there was only one person in the class.
Background: getting my business off the ground and after listening to the Facebook live on marketing about playing to our strengths I decided to follow that advice. I am best one-on-one. I just gave a free consult to someone who has Medicare Advantage and I don't know that I want to contract with another system. I need to start getting some income and spreading the word and this might be my way.
She probably just needs some basic exercises I've given in classes before.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** kudos to u for thinking of those less well off.  you cant have different classes in my state...tier billing.  I decided to not contract with Medicaid but instead, offer pro bono services as need arises.

> **Response 2:** Be sure to always check those OON benefits. I've come across several with the same in/out benefits

Hey everyone!

I own Atomic Physical Therapy in Boulder and Broomfield CO. We are expanding our team and looking for a running specific PT. The clientele is more than runners but we want someone who has an interest and experience with running to take over for my share of that caseload and grow into their own. If anyone is interested or knows of an interested party I can pass along the official job listing. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

I have a new client with POTS. I have seen book recommendations here in the past but can’t seem to find them. Can anyone share good resources with me! Thanks in advance 🙌🏼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have POTS and work with many patients with POTS.  I don’t have a protocol per se… but you basically just have to meet your patient where they are and have compassion. The thing about POTS is its autonomic dysfunction.  The nervous system will literally do what it wants, when wants, with no explanation or reasoning. So when your patients sound crazy that they can’t do a single bridge one day, when they did 30 squats the day before…. They aren’t faking it. 
With exercise you have to realize they have really low blood pressure post of the time. So when they are at their worst, you start with seriously WHATEVER they can do. Supine glute squeezes.  I’ve had patients I had to start with 5 glute squeezes… and that’s all they can do.  You start with supine exercises so the blood doesn’t rush out of their head being upright. But you want to increase time of their muscles to out pressure on the blood vessels. Go slow, and let them tell you what they can and can’t do. And literally… if some days they can’t do anything… then they can’t do anything. Increase salt intake like crazy. I use LMNT packets. No sugar, high sodium. I literally could have 4 of those a day or more sometimes. It’s really about the patient leading their own NEW body and their boundaries and you listening.  The problem with most of these patients is that EVERYONE in the medical community has told them they are crazy. So as long as you listen and are compassionate… you will help them in a way no one else has

Anyone with Hellonote migrate from 1.0 to 2.0? Was it worth it or should I stay with 1.0? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm on 2.0 since November and it's been really smooth. It's worth the transition for the scheduler and general speed imo

> **Response 2:** Been on 2.0 since November. There were some issues but they’ve been quick to fix. Honestly haven’t had much Trouble using it at all.

**Original Post:**
✨HIRING Question✨

We are in a fortunate position to have two amazing applicants applying for our newest role out of a climbing gym. 

We are expanding to a neighboring town and are looking to hire someone READY to go. We are looking for a climbing specialist and someone with cash pay experience to minimize time spent training. 

One applicant has previous cash experience, ATC/PT degree and has worked at the NFL in a medical capacity, and made a great in person impression with confidence. They don’t have climbing experience but are planning to start and have expressed interest in reviewing literature to make sure they are in top of it. 

The other one is coming from insurance based models but is literally a long term member of the gym we are going to be working out of and is an avid climber/integrated with the community. I haven’t interviewed in person yet. 

Just curious if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions for me as we finish up the interviewing process? In a perfect world we’d take both but I don’t have the capacity to bring on 2 people as we also have a relatively new hire we are already bringing up to speed. And we don’t want to be greedy and split potential income earnings as our hires are hourly until reaching a certain threshold. 

Thanks I’m advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A few questions we ask when making this decision. Who do we see growing with us long term? Who embodies our core values and our mission/vision the most? 

We hired a therapist this summer who only had experience in insurance clinic and was not trained in the pelvic health niche but when asking those questions she was the one that checked the boxes. We passed up on another candidate who had advanced pelvic health training and also cash clinic experience.

After 6 weeks of training our therapist did $15K in her first month seeing new evals.

Like David Bayliff said hire the person who has the skills/characteristics that you can’t train or the skills that are much harder to learn

> **Response 2:** Not really a solution, but I would try to find a way to hire them both if you are planning to grow to that point in the future. Maybe pay by the visit to start as they build caseload. Maybe they can get a PRN gig elsewhere while they build with you.

It’s hard to find good employees that are a good cultural fit, so if you feel they would help build your culture, I would try any way possible to hire both in some capacity.

Is this normal or right?? Im under $20,000 but not by tons?? This is so weird ….?  Anyone else?? I printed up my financial summary but ….?

**Community Responses:**

Can you be an independent contractor with a couple of companies using your LLC and file as and S/Corp classification for tax purposes? I’m still new to all this and needed some guidance. 

￼TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, but best to get advice from your tax advisor

> **Response 2:** Like Marni Matyus said, best to check with your tax advisor on this specific question.
However, can you do independent contract work through your business (ex: the employer hires “Hirani Physical Therapy” vs Jagruti Hirani) ?? 
The answer is YES!

Anyone have any recommendations for an AFO that you can buy over the counter - preferably on Amazon? Have a stroke patient that needs some help with foot drop and knee buckling, but not looking to go custom made route yet.  
Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just depends on how much you want to spend and if they're diabetic/ skin issues.  Amazon carries a wide range of prices

> **Response 2:** There’s lots on Amazon. If there is knee buckling I would go with an off the shelf rigid where the trim lines are at least even with or slightly anterior to the malleoli. A posterior leaf spring (PLS) will not assist tibial collapse. I have found some rigid or semi rigid (posterior to malleolus) for around $45 on Amazon. PLS and semi rigid will both help with the foot drop. I’ll attach the links I use for each in a few moments. EDIT: please remember polypropylene isn’t ideal if there is sensation loss or cog impairment. Due to moisture, pt needs to be responsible for skin checks. Also couldn’t find a true rigid I would recommend above a custom. The “rigid” ones on Amazon all come with their own issues, so more of a “know your pt and what exactly they need”. Hope this helps 🙂

Torn between Iplum or sideline
Has anyone used both or have a preference?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Let me help you decide. I use both. If it's just a single person practice. Use sidelines. If you have a team, use iplum.

My sidelines is 731-882-7783. Only two person can answer it and rolls over to my assistant if I missed a call. 

My iplum is 731-215-0919 and can be directed to multiple lines. Call and try it. 

Good luck!

> **Response 2:** I use iplum. I don’t love it. Thinking of switching to Google voice. I need to be able to have at least a second line (which I can do with iplum) but I have a few issues with it.
1) works great when I am in the clinic but if I’m on the road, calls drop when I try to switch over from another call.
2) address book is separate from my iPhone which is VERY annoying. Saving contacts in it is a bit cumbersome.
3) texting and sharing photos in messages works but not as easily as regular phone. Can’t share videos on it either.
4) customer support is only through email and only marginally helpful.￼￼

Question for the mobile therapists:  I don’t want to list my home address in directories and the like.  What’s your solution for this problem?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not mobile but when I first started my practice I was working out of my house and had the same problem. As far as Google is concerned, you can say you cover a particular area as opposed to a physical address (ie the city you work in) and it won’t show an address publicly. I also got a PO Box and was able to list that as a mailing address for many things. However, there’s unfortunately no way that I know of to make it entirely private, as some things require a physical address, not a PO Box. I’m in Colorado and my state did not allow a PO Box to be used when forming my business. The only other suggestion I have is to see if you can get a PO Box with an actual street address, as some places do offer that option. Best of luck!

> **Response 2:** I registered my business when we were in the process of moving to a new state and needed an address before I had one!  I opened a small UPS store box which gave a real physical address for opening my business. It’s not a PO Box number, it’s a real address. That worked for me.

Anybody in here know of any free mentorship groups? This group is extremely helpful, but wondering if anyone knows of experienced clinicians that do free zooms calls several times a month or week to share ideas of their successes or difficulties with being an uncaged clinician?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t know of anyone doing this for free and I doubt someone who is running a successful business has that much time to donate.  It can seem scary to invest when you aren’t bringing in a lot of revenue but it’s worth it. I encourage you to set up a call with the uncaged team. It’s a great place to get started.  You get what you pay for.

> **Response 2:** Recommend a group coaching program with some pelt who walk the elk and just not talk it.   There are some self placed online programs for beginners that help get your feet wet before you need need a coach.  There's helpful fb groups to search your topic of question within the group  and find answers to so many questions.  People don't use the search feature enough in groups. 
But i think an online self paced can be helpful.  
Where are you at in your business
What do you need help with
What's your biggest struggle
What's your biggest fear
What is one thing you want help with right now to move forward
What is driving you crazy

I have a third party payer that owes me 2200 give or take for treatment. They are waiting till the case is closed although patient hasn’t come to PT since November. Going on to have MRIs etc. is it common to not see payment in cases like this till the whole ordeal is closed ? I have left messages etc and don’t hear back. The original case manager is no longer the case manager… just curious as it’s my first rodeo in my own business where i handle all the billing and treatment! They tried to get the patient to settle but he refuses until he has exhausted his testing options due to some residual complaints. We were on hold until after his follow up diagnostics but I’m looking to get paid at this point! Thanks for any info if someone has been down this road! Yea I got permission all along for the PT treatments.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve found that auto pays out until the policy is exhausted. What you’re describing sounds like a legal case where your payment will be part of the final settlement. In that case they’ll pay you when the case settles. (after trying to negotiate and have you accept less)

> **Response 2:** This is why you don’t take those insurances. Sure, they pay well when you finally get paid. But you may be waiting a long time. You won’t get a dime til the case is over. And the amount of time that takes is anyone’s guess

Does anyone have security cameras in the office?  This is more on the lines of thinking if you are a solo practitioner or if there may be unavoidable times when you are alone in the office to protect yourself from false allegations.  Can it only be recording waiting room space?  Or I guess you'd have to have everyone sign something agreeing to being recorded, but I foresee that being problematic for some.

**Community Responses:**

If someone doesn't have a support network  is there something available for them when they transition home? If their family won't help them? 
I have a client that has agoraphobia is having double hip replacement, doesn't have support from her family, etc. 
Is there any sort of other organization that can help? 
I would say part a Medicare but she's afraid to go into a rehab facility?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Laura Iden Gibbons contact Brick Senior services or whichever town she lives in. Perhaps they can provide some resources. 
Also if she qualifies for part A at home might be worth that then she’d have all services available for a few weeks . Then you take over after.

> **Response 2:** Best bet may be hiring a caregiver if they can afford it

2 positives yesterday 
A patient told her friend about our clinic…
1. “My friend is going to come to you because the place she goes now puts her on machines and walks away.”  “You stay with me the whole time’”

2. The  people at that other place are not very nice.

(Positives for me but sorry this even happens )

Hi all! I am in need of advice. I have a cash based client that texts me all the time, including all hours of the night. How can I tell her to stop texting me professionally. I am not a 24 hour a day clinic and I only see her for one to two or Dry Needling sessions per week.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Answer texts with “let’s address this at your next session” but only during working hours

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Personally, success has been when I can disconnect from work and give my family my 100% attention. 

For the business, success has been when people tell others about me and how I was able to help them in ways the traditional healthcare model didn't.

> **Response 2:** I was a family wedding this weekend and everybody was asking me how the business was going. 
It brought up a conversation about success and how everybody’s definition of success is different.  
It used to be a purely financially defined word.  I think it’s so different nowadays.
For me, I feel my business is successful if it is bringing in enough financially to support me and my family, allow us to do some travel and go out for meals and buy gifts and things like that.  And if it is supporting me in that way without me treating patients every hour, then I consider that a big success!
I’m currently doing about 1% of my businesses’ treatments and the rest of the time I’m spending working ON my business.

Wondering if anyone has recommendations on third-party systems for collecting payment. I see on average 5 clients per week and currently accept cash/check. I have a new patient who I will be seeing virtually and need to find a different option to receive payment. Zelle is not an option where I do my banking. Thanks so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Square. You can get a free reader that works on your phone and you only pay for what you charge. So, if you didn’t run a credit card for an entire month, you don’t pay anything.

> **Response 2:** Are there any issues using Venmo business? The per transaction fee is much less compared to Square, Stripe, Ivy, etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Iplum

> **Response 2:** There are so many patients I wouldn’t want texting me on my personal cell but that’s just my preference. 

I use RingCentral for a work number. It has an app that allows you to call out from your work number and marks incoming calls with an identifier so you know it’s a work call. You can also text through their app. 

I like that it keeps things a little separate for me without needing another device.  I don’t check the RingCentral activity on the weekends/evenings but could if I wanted to.

Hi Everyone! I will be speaking at a golf clinic about the importance of fitness & mobility training for injury prevention and performance. During the presentation I will be demonstrating a generalized golf specific warm up and handing out a physical copy of the exercises for participants to take home. Does anyone have a consent/liability waiver for workshops similar to this that they could share? It would be a huge help. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just curious what the liability waiver would be for? If you are worried that someone might try one of your exercises on the sheet and get hurt you can simply put a disclaimer saying the exercises might not be appropriate for each individual. I’ve been doing workshops for about 7 years and we’ve never had an issue with that approach

Wanting to open a cash only mobile PT business. Does anyone know where the stipulations are for being able to offer payment via HSA and FSA cards? 

Thanks so much! Any resources would be helpful!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use square with HSA and FSA without any issues or stipulations. When I had an HSA card, it was up to me to make sure I used it appropriately, not on the business I was using it at.

Looking for advice from anyone who treats out of their homes. I am considering putting a finished “shed” in my backyard instead of traveling to homes (I need a home gym anyways and would love to save time during the day). My question is if anyone has ever had issues with giving your address to so many clients. I live in a safe town and would plan on installing outdoor cameras, but something about it makes me stop and think for a bit. 

Any advice is appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just want one to have as my own she shed so I can watch TV and chill without anyone bothering me!!

> **Response 2:** Need to check with your town zoning. If it’s not zoned commercial and you have patients / clients coming in and out, could be a problem. But if that’s ok, I’d go for it!

Giving my notice next week. my “side” business is consistently averaging 13-16 (never less than 13) sessions a week (15 is my max availability for the week currently and sometimes I add an extra session).
My financial budget is 19. So I plan on staying PRN on my current HH job until I get there and feel comfortable. Currently there are 2 openings in my company already, so I expect they will need help, but my area is the most desired and likely will fill faster, and I am not interested in driving far. Trying to decide if (for safety) I should apply as PRN to additional agencies in the area…. 
Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go all in!! You can always apply PRN later if you need it

> **Response 2:** I wouldn’t add another. Think 2x the competencies, learning modules, etc. You got this 💪🏻

Wanted to share a recent win! So i recently started my mobile practice treating MMA fighters and combat athletes as my niche!

Marketing question: planning on going "uncaged" 2nd qtr 2023.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you plan to stay just you forever you could probably do that. However if you ever plan to hire someone else keep in mind people may be turned off when they don’t get the person who’s name is on the sign. 
I’m currently solo but went with a generic name in case I ever expand.

> **Response 2:** David Bayliff Awesome stuff! Thank you David and Brendan Connor for your insights. I think I am going to use a generic name with the idea of potential expansion. I don't like using my name for the name of the business. Just seems weird

Does anyone have experience with https://relayfi.com/ for setting up a Profit first account structure? Or does anyone have any other  banks they recommend for setting up multiple accounts without minimum fees? BOA does not play nicely with this system.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use a local credit union. They don't care how many accounts I set up, as long as they don't drop below zero. 🤣

No fees for multiple accounts, no fees for having a zero balance.

> **Response 2:** I use Novo. Fairly easy. Syncs with everything else I do (square, wave accounting, etc). I have one main account but use the “reserve” function and have it set up that each time money comes in, it automatically divides up based on percentages I set to the reserves. Then when I need the money to pay myself, bills, etc. I release funds from the specific reserve acct to the general acct and with drawl from there. (I hope that makes sense).

Hey everyone, 

I am PT but couldn’t solve the debate with my friend so asking here. 

Can back pain originate from sleeping on hard surface? 

What’s the best surface for a 26year old female to sleep on between these 2- 1) a box mattress or 2) on a blanket on carpeted floor? 

She has been complaining of back pain for 6 months now but refuses to buy a better  mattress to sleep on because she doesn’t believe it’s because of her sleeping choice.  

Admin Please let me know if it’s not allowed to post this here. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What she believes is more important than what you tell her.  Connect with her beliefs and narratives about her pain.  After 6 months it is about more than a bed.  Biopsychosocial model of pain.

> **Response 2:** So the hard surface doesn’t CAUSE the back pain. There was a dysfunction there that just became more obvious because of the hard surface (i.e. hyper mobility in the lumbar spine or hypo mobility in the thoracic spine)

Food for thought... 

I would have NEVER (successfully) been able to run 100 miles without two things...

TRAINING, and HELP FROM OTHERS!

Why is this important? Because running an ultramarathon is analogous to running a business. 

🏃‍♀️You will experience many highs 

🏃‍♀️ You will experience many lows

🏃‍♀️ You will have extreme moments of self-doubt 

🏃‍♀️ You will have seasons (or miles) of asking yourself, "why did I do this in the first place"?

🏃‍♀️ You will be gifted moments of triumph - unlike any you could get from doing anything less challenging

🏃‍♀️ You will prove to yourself that you can withstand the storms and be strengthened in the face of adversity

In my 8 years as an Ultratunner, I've learned a powerful truth: 

The best race-day performances come when I've invested the proper time into training, and put my trust in others (i.e. coaches, and people who have done it before me). 

Running a business is no different. 

You want the most enjoyable race? Or you want to enjoy your journey to business ownership? DO THESE TWO THINGS...

1. Invest in the time it takes to PREPARE for the hurdles you will inevitably face. 
1. AND for heavens sake - INVEST IN PROFESSIONALS who have BEEN THERE to help you! 

Looking for some guides who have been where you stand? Link in comments...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So sooo true !! That’s why I hired run coach ( even I am one ☝️) and business coaches  without them I will be lost 😞!! Thank you #uncaged family !! Love you guys !!!!

> **Response 2:** I’m running a marathon this year…the first thing I did was hire a run coach for the first time. Such simple and powerful advice here for anyone to take and find true success in life and in business. Thanks Kalyca Jin Zarich!

Is anyone an OT in NH? My sister lives in Hanover and since having her son 3 months ago has been having serious thumb pain. Just a quick google search of her area tells me there are basically ZERO OTs in her area, and very few in NH in general. Can anyone point me in a good direction?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We do hand therapy, Abby.

> **Response 2:** It’s a bit of a drive for her but Candee Adams is an excellent OT that I have referred hand/thumb patients to in Plymouth, NH. She works for Choice PT

I need some advice! I'm a pediatric OT doing home health with my OWN business. However, due to crazy ass gas prices, I need to increase my prices. But how do I let my parents know? E-mail? Anyone have a template? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You don't explain. You just do it my friend. If they value your services. They won't budge. My doctor's office don't tell me if they increase their prices. My massage therapist don't tell me if she increased her prices. No need to justify. You just tell them your new rate. You want to come from an abundance mentality and not scarcity. They will appreciate you more. Good luck my friend.

> **Response 2:** Just a word on your wording here. You are doing mobile outpatient treatment versus home health?

Question for the foot people- I have a marthon runner that has sharp pain/pinch on the anterior Subtaylor joint.  Slightly limited in posterior mobility, 5 DF.  It almost acts like a small tear, but no click and all testing negative.  Any suggestions?  TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a marathon runner and a PT who works with runners- I genuinely emphasize ruling out a stress fracture. Those can get back pretty quickly if they keep running.

> **Response 2:** I like the recs in the other comments. I’d also do a trial of a navicular lift taping from the lateral foot, going under the arch and then drawing up on the navicular and medial talus. See if that support reduces the pain from initial contact to foot flat.

has anyone ever heard of the muldowney protocol for EDS, or know how to find a practitioner who has done any training with this? I looked them up and it's a specific clinic, but I don't see anything about them teaching this protocol to other therapists

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Buy his book.  It's super easy. I used it with my patients often (had them purchase as well). 

I did alter/change/upgrade/downgrade etc etc when I didn't clinically agree but it's an easy foundation to start with.

> **Response 2:** I second getting the Muldowney book. It is easy to follow and addresses the patient and the PT with specifics on modifications.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They most likely put themselves as your registered agent, this is something that every state requires you have. However, many ppl put themselves to avoid fees. You can leave it with them or cx and update your filing to say whoever you'd like. If you put yourself, it's best to put where your office is as address so someone is there if you receive a delivery.

I am opening a mobile PT practice in NJ…I see I can’t use a virtual office for my address. I want to use registered agent but there is no clear answer whether “Google my business” will identify it. I do not want my personal address to be linked to my practice for safety at all. Would appreciate any insights. If there are ways around it, I will appreciate that as well. Thank you so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I talk to a lot of therapists who want to keep their home address private, but the reality is there are already so many public resources that probably list your personal name to your residence like property tax records and various directory listings. 

In my experience if someone wants to find you they are more than capable of doing so. Plus, therapy is a pretty low risk profession. It isn’t like you are going to be a bounty hunter, judge, or attorney. 

Do a search to see where your information is already available and then decide if it is still worth trying to stay anonymous.

> **Response 2:** Good info. I haven’t been able to get google verification.  As long as there is definitely a way to hide address on listing I’d do it

Daily assistance with ADLS, IADLS, picking up groceries, medications and accompanying them to apts (not driving them)

I live in Texas. I’m in such desperate need to get out of therapy.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I can connect you with a couple different therapists doing this!  We also have a training coming up on it April 30. We added it to my practice. Just keep it limited to a few people. There are a few things you need to check in your state regarding licensing.

Today’s 3 Minute LION’s ROAR… 
Mission vs Metrics

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good tip. The metrics emphasized should paint the picture of mission success/failure.

> **Response 2:** I like what you say Captain ! It’s a great reminder to always focus on the Mission of your business. I describe the acronym m.i.s.s.i.o.n.  for your business as to : mobilize, innovate, strategize, serve, inspire, optimize, and navigate! ￼Yes, there’s a lot of distractions with the availability of different systems that say they want to help increase your sales, etc. but I believe they would have to really know what your mission is and understand it as well as you begin to understand it in order to deliver the level of quality of service that you aspire to deliver to your customers! So I believe the metrics can come in later in your business when you have developed a solid foundation of principles in place to help you stay authentic and have good clarity!

Creative Minds, I need help!
I am starting a fitness class at a local yoga studio focusing on wrapping strength, function, and mindfulness into one class. We want to focus on awareness and connection with the body through breathing and movement, while lifting weights to improve health and function.
The studio owner and I are both super excited about this but I need to come up with a name for it and I am having trouble. 

I would love your help with any ideas!
-The studio's name is Heart, Mind, Healing 
-There is a crossfitish training studio and a women's gym that offers group classes in the shopping center and the name can't encroach on the other businesses offerings (this is my main problem)
-My business is Spectrum PT and Performance 
-The studio owner said having Strength in the name might scare away the population she hopes to attend the class. 
-The class offerings she has currently are called Mindful Movement so it can't be called that

Also, if anyone has done this type of thing before I would love any tips! I've never taught in a small group setting before

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t know about CEUs but Dr Wahls has a professional course with certification on her protocol. Mostly on nutrition and lifestyle changes. She also strongly believes in the  use of functional estim.  I would recommend reading her book on The Wahls protocol especially if you will be doing wellness. I found her book and her lectures quite informative from a wholistic point of view.

> **Response 2:** Heather, I’ve had the privilege of working with many patients with MS for the past decade, and I’ve taught coursework on PT management for this patient population. I’m happy to consult and answer any specific questions you may have on any of your patients. As was alluded by earlier comments, the best approach you can take is a lifestyle medicine approach. Feel free to message me.

I’m interested in branching out to do speaking engagements & presentations. Does anyone have suggestions for developing a plan to move from ‘free’ to paid?

I have some basic ideas for topics ranging from motivational to actual skills/useful tips! 

I’m not sure I’m thinking broadly enough about how to structure options. Or maybe I’m thinking too broadly. 

At this point I’m open to any and all suggestions and insight from those of you that have done this! Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks for the tag Sue Doyle . And Amy Homan DePoy how can I help? There are two things in the speaking industry. One is the art and science of speaking. And the other one is the business of speaking. You need to have both of course. We all have the art and science because we are all therapist and know how to speak to an audience "our patients" but we forget the business of it that we need networking and referral and reaching out to an appropriate group of people.

Same thing with therapy. We all know the art and science of treatment and evaluation. But have an issue in the business of it "billing, ein, LLC, referrals sources" etc.

Let me know if you need anything else. 😁😁😁

Hi all - I'm looking for a PT with specialized concussion experience in Baltimore city for a family member dealing with headache and neck pain ~2 months post-concussion. Ideally looking for a setting with a private treatment space as they're still having a lot of sensitivity to light, sound, and other sensory stimulation. (I got a great recommendation for 2 PTs at Hopkins, but it turns out their Baltimore location is not in-network with my family member's insurance and the self-pay rate is much higher than most). Any recommendations appreciated!

You only get a limited number of "projects" with their free option and limited number of downloads for printing, but the paid subscription is pretty reasonable and worth it if you like the templates and use it often.

Kindof silly question coming at you all: writing articles.

Are we just brain dumping on a particular subject?  Are these long articles, or just a few paragraphs?  Are we doing research specifically for the article, or are they more anecdotal based on our experience and knowledge?  Are these just sort of blog posts that we're calling articles?  How are we "publishing" them?

I'm feeling stuck on writing anything, because I feel like there must be some "rules" but maybe I'm just limiting myself for no reason other than imposter syndrome.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it depends on where you are submitting these... Are we talking about blog posts for your own blog, someone else's blog, an online site, etc? 
You can write about anything, but there's some ways to tailor it to where you're posting the writing....

> **Response 2:** You can write anything you want in any way that you feel will be helpful for your target audience.

Any Dance PT’s here?? Does anyone have a patellar stabilization brace that allows for full knee ROM?   Anxious dancer about to start competition season and still needs a little more support.   Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Here! My opinion is that KT tape is the only thing that most answers are performers will tolerate in order to have full range of motion. ￼It will help with proprioceptive input as well as give her the confidence to perform. I recommend trying it in rehearsals first to make sure she can go full out.

**Community Responses:**

Has anyone here used red light therapy or shockwave therapy in their clinic? I’ve never tried either but keep hearing good things. Curious if it’s worth adding to services

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes for both. We use redlight on the daily and shockwave has been great!

> **Response 2:** I find red light is so affordable for patients to get on their own and is also more beneficial to use it regularly so I have it in the clinic to have them try in session and then guide them in purchasing their own. 
Another PT in my office bought a more expensive unit to have people pay to use it and no one really did

Also, having reliable automation and scheduling tools in place will save you tons of time. Happy to share a couple of names if you’re interested!

Have any of you out there worked with patients with energy storing and returning AFOs? 
I am referring to ones similar to the Exosym, Fabtech Reactiv, Hanger Hi Pro Performance AFO, etc.

I am working on building a list of PT providers around the country who are familiar with these devices and know how to train patients to use them.  

If you have experience with them I would like to add you to my PT provider list.

Please put your business and contact information below. If you message me sometimes I don't always see them, thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This list would be awesome! I’m a prosthetic user (BKA) and I would have loved to have a resource like this available when I became an amputee. It’s HARD finding PTs who are knowledgeable in retraining gait & even improving strength when limited by any sort of prosthetic or orthotic device.

> **Response 2:** I actually work for Hanger, seeing orthotic and prosthetic cases to help patients get the most out of their devices and help PTs interested in these populations understand the devices…. Would love to be of assistance with this

I always get the feeling that these are scams, but just wanted to see if anyone has had a good experience with any of these companies that actually helped their business grow?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If something seems too good to be true.....it usually is.....

> **Response 2:** I once signed up for some “free” marketing advise thinking they’ll just email me something but then was bombarded with emails, phone calls and texts, all hours of the day. When someone tries that hard, you lose trust. I also get weekly calls from a business saying I’m qualified for a business loan which I never applied for and the numbers are all different with local area codes but are from out of state. I think it’s a patient calling and it ends up being a marketer😡

What Would You Do?

Some basic info,
* renting out of a facility that runs by memberships mostly
* all members are given number of "credits/tokens" they can use towards any services provided within the facility (including PT)
* $100 - 30 mins / $200 - 1 hr (rate discussion between the facility and my PT business)
* have a great relationship with the facility owner and their trainers (on the same page as far as team mentality in helping a client reach their goal)

I am not 100% sure on this, but can I provide those members with superbills even if I am being paid by the facility and not by the members directly? I don't believe I can, but if anyone has similar experience, I'd love to hear your experience.

This setup will help fill my schedule and my wife's schedule as well (she is a PT as well) because she will transition to work with me very soon.

Thanks in advance for reading!

**Community Responses:**

Hey everyone! I need some advice, please. Last night I went to a huge networking event at an outpatient pelvic health clinic that has other services for prenatal and postpartum patients. I am a CLT and I spoke to a lot of birthworkers about the benefit of MLD for perinatal swelling and breastfeeding issues. I passed out a lot of business cards and brochures, so they all have my info. What I'm unsure about is what the next step is for me, in terms of following up with these other providers. As always, thank you all for your words of wisdom!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would reach out to them individually and plan a coffee date to get to know them more one on one. Be curious and ask questions about them and their business/profession…how can you help them…who can you refer to them. That’s how you build trusting relationships.

> **Response 2:** For me, I make sure I also gathered their info. I wait a day or two & then email any contacts I feel would be good mutual partnerships. I structure email in a way to promote them & if I really feel it would be a good lead ask if they have time in the next 1-2 weeks to grab coffee. I also connect with them on LinkedIn. If you are using social media & they are also connect those accounts.

Best coffee maker for a clinic? Need something low maintenance, extra points if we can serve local coffee beans with it!

Keurig would be easiest, but I cannot stand the coffee and I’m leaning towards a pot of coffee to refresh every 2-4 hours.

EDITED TO UPDATE: I bought an Instantpot (I know, weird) single cup coffeemaker that actually takes nespresso and keurig cups and refillable pods!!!

Yay for the best of all worlds 🙌🙌🙌

**Community Responses:**

Former coworker has reached out with questions regarding an upcoming patient they will be treating for an area this provider isn’t knowledgeable about but I am. I have no issues with this PT but was undervalued at the company and my consistent mentoring and educating was overlooked/abused (this former coworker is still there). 

Question… How do I respond to this person regarding the request for help/tips? Also, this is not the first person from former company to reach out for help. I have previously responded with help but finally directed that PT to another PT that works there and their (my former) director.  I have learned to value both my time and expertise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You could offer to do a mentor session with the PT reaching out. “Hey I’d love to help educate you on this topic. Could we set up a time to sit down and discuss to make sure I have answered all your questions? My rate is xx/hour for mentor sessions”.  Then it’s on them… You offered to help. 

I’ve paid for several of these with therapists who are more experienced than I am ranging anywhere from $50/hour to $250/hour.

> **Response 2:** 1.  You no longer work there, do not respond. You are not getting paid for your expertise.  
2. That PT should either defer the case to a current and present PT with more experience with such diagnosis, or go do more research. 
 
I'm sorry, but it is ALL OF OUR professional responsibilities to do #2 when in doubt.  If you had been more respected, then sure help if you feel inclined but I think its time for professionals to step up and do research on what they dont know.  Great opportunity to learn and for growth.  If you still worked there it would be a great opportunity to network and collaborate.  Dont let them use you.

What are everyone’s thoughts about using personal cellphone for business? Are there any legal problems with this? 
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have been using my personal number/phone for several years and have not had any trouble. No one in the contact list is identified as a patient. And it's been extremely useful for pts/families to send messages regarding changes in schedules that I may not be able to answer while with another pt. I do have a form that explains the purpose and boundaries of the use of texting and emails to/from pts and they must sign before I communicate in this manner.

> **Response 2:** Having a designated business line helps me. I’ve got an out of state number so I don’t want people thinking I’m spam. 

Having the business line allows me to have it on my phone and my office managers phone. Huge benefit.

Advice on what to say/how to announce I'm closing my practice? I took on a nonclinical role with a company due to my chronic pain/health & uncertain economy. My client base was people who have pain as well. This is a stressful time, as I'm a little skeptical taking on this new job. Right now I'm just seeing people on one weekend day, but need to taper down to have weekends free for my own wellbeing soon

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The suggestions made already:
👉 Be honest. 
👉 Thank them for their trust and loyalty. 
👉 Help them to find a comparable provider.

I agree 💯

> **Response 2:** Help them find someone who has similar values to yourself. That lets them know you continue to think of them.

Allyson fixed my problem and I want to know what other magic she can do for my business 
Thankful for this group
Happy new year 

Help! Tech people 
Suddenly all my emails have gone to people spam. Even people in my own Google domain with my own email. Somehow the universe labeled me spam , I have to send out invoices and have some important email updates I need to send ASAP. I do not spam people. I don’t email regularly. I don’t send group emails. There no reason for it. Any immediate advice to solve this problem?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you have your DMARC, SPF, and dkim in place on your DNS settings for email? If not, that's why. Let me know if you need help, I can walk you thru it.

> **Response 2:** Not sure if there’s any immediate fix, but I know that it helps if you have a lot of engagement. So if you have some people respond to your emails, they will start to recognize that you aren’t spam. And obviously notify your clients to look in the spam folder and mark not as spam. Not sure any of these are quick fixes though.

Looking for some input on how to best handle a situation…i just started help coach HS softball, and as we are early in the season, several of the girls are having some soreness or dealing with some minor injuries. I’ve had a few kids ask about stuff at practice, as well as some parents text me asking if I could “take a look at so & so’s injury after practice some nite”…any thoughts on how to beat handle this…some of the stuff can be helped with a simple stretch, some obviously more involved that really needs a full eval. I’d like to come up with a statement or policy about how to handle these requests, and possibly even put together a proposal to the school about maybe offering a few hours/week of eval/tx time at school (even if it’s just a simple hourly rate to screen these kids & then best direct care).  Anybody have experience with a similar situation & what’s worked, what you’d avoid, etc? TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is what Jackie Clark does!

> **Response 2:** I get this a lot bc I coach CrossFit where my office is. My approach is usually “without getting to evaluate and see what’s actually going on I can’t be 100% sure, but you could try…” and give a couple things you’re comfortable with assigning that seem appropriate. “If it’s not feeling better in a week, it’s probably more involved and you should have it formally checked out”. Of course, since there are minors involved, involve parent/guardian in the conversation so they know what’s up.

Recently I participated in a seminar on BFR for health professionals. I was impressed with the the level of experience of the fellow clinicians from many disciplines who have been interviewed on the subject. So I decided to compile them into a virtual “micro summit” on BFR.  

I shared it with David and he thought it was informative and gave his permission to share it here. Thank you David!  

Here is the link to the brief BFR talks. (It is free). 

Some of the information is timely as it talks about an upcoming event with Todd Durkin and a certification if you are looking to get more into BFR.  

Feel free to reach out with any questions.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I teach Yoga Physical Therapy classes that keeps me seeing patients without the need to formally see them. But it also keeps them seeing me on a regular basis so I am who they think of when they hurt something again or something else or a family/friend need help.

Question for you that have mobile 100% cash based practices and multiple therapists- how do you guys deal with other therapists collecting payments for example if a client wants to give a check for a package of sessions?

This therapist lives roughly 45 minutes from me and I would prefer a figure out another option. I have a Square payment processor myself but I'm curious what others do in this situation. Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My intake forms ask for a card on file which most people prefer. For checks, I usually do mobile deposits from my phone so maybe that would work?

> **Response 2:** I think you could use IvyPay app for the client payment

Occupational therapist here with 13 years of experience soon to interview for a 3 x 10-hour weekend acute care position.

 (1) In relation to a traditional 40-hour work week, what would you expect the salary to be for this position? Do you feel it should be 75% of a 40-hour work week salary or incentivized with a bit higher salary for the non-traditional schedule? 

(2) What would your concerns be for this schedule? Topics to address during the interview?

Thanks for your time!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I thought they made pretty close to a full salary. When I worked in home care we had therapists who worked Friday Saturday Sunday or Saturday Sunday Monday and they made a full, full-time salary.

> **Response 2:** As a weekend therapist I would ask what the incentive for weekend work is and I would ask how many weekends you are allowed to ask off for. Even as a full time weekday therapist in both acute and home health there is a weekend differential, so I got paid a little bit more for my weekend hours than my weekday hours, so as someone who dedicates all weekends I would expect that as well. 
Benefit would be similar to a nursing schedule, when you take one weekend off you have nearly two weeks of days off with only taking 30 hours PTO. but, like i said, ask how many weekends you’re allowed to ask off for. I worked for a hospital and we had a weekend warrior team, and I think they were allowed 4 weekends for PTO requests. Obviously if something came up we made it work, like family emergency, bereavement, etc. but as requests off they were limited in how many they could ask for in the year. But they got paid a fairly hefty differential, more than just the weekend differential for weekday clinicians. 
Also ask if there is a time commitment, our weekend warriors signed on for a year commitment to the weekend plan. Again, they got paid a nice differential to do it so it was mostly our younger/new grads who would do it for 1-2 years for the extra pay, and then transition to weekday team

Hi! OT here, I’m interested in obtained my MLD certification and opening my own business offering lymphedema drainage massage for general wellness (also to include face/body, slimmimg, postpartum), post op (to include total joints, post mastectomies, post mommy make overs) etc. Thoughts on this? Has anyone done this? Do you think this would be successful? I’m thinking starting cash pay but potentially also integrating some insurance. Looking for advice, success stories, non success stories, thoughts, etc!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There is a huge market for MLD, especially if you partner with physicians who recommend it post surgery. 

It is one of the easiest manual therapy modalities on the practicioner and it pairs nicely with cranio-sacral and myofascial work..

There are options to add instrument assisted lymphatic drainage (I use the Lymphstar pro) and even gentle cupping (gliding cups) can be used. 

I think solving a specific problem for a specific demographic is a smart move. 

Even if you shift your target demographic or shift to a different modality, the MLD experience and training wilp serve any manual therapist quite well..I think it should rest required coursework for anyone who practices manual therapy.

> **Response 2:** 🙋🏻‍♀️ I’m happy to chat! Congratulations on taking the step toward being uncaged—that’s an exciting move. I am PT CLT OnCS

For those of you that have YouTube or made other videos, do you use your iPhone or have you had a real camera crew help in filming? Trying to make a mobility for runners course and want it to look professional

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For the first three years I strictly used my phone for ease of use. iPhones can take really good videos! We just upgraded to a more professional camera. Camera crews typically are pretty costly and probably not necessary at first.

> **Response 2:** Lighting is also key and probably makes a bigger impact than an expensive camera vs an iPhone on good settings. I have a nice light and microphone from Amazon I paid less than $200 for both together

I have an opportunity to provide a raffle item and goodie bag filler for an event that could give me some great exposure.  What are the rules on providing something like a free service for a raffle or should I do something tangible like a piece of therapy equipment? I was considering something relatively low effort for me, like a 45 minute virtual wellness type service - maybe ergo consultation.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this or know of any rules?

**Community Responses:**

Hello, I’m looking for a knee bolster/crescent. I bought one from “source ortho” which ended up being a scam. Does anyone have one for sale, especially in the DC/MD/VA area to avoid shipping? Or where do you buy them for a good price? When I look at reviews of the affordable ones on Amazon they don’t look fully stuffed. Very bad quality. I work for a small business and so I buy my own supplies. THANKS IN ADVANCE 🌟

The private PT clinic I work for has decided to close. It rents a room and shares a fitness area within a large golf membership facility. I dont have the ability to open my own business here but its a great opportunity for anyone who is looking to open their own business and has an interest in golf. Its in Lombard, IL. This isnt a job post, just thought this might be a good place to see i anyone is interested in the golf guys contact info. Message me if you want his info.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you have the desire to open your own place? Is it just the money that’s an issue? Have you been working in the space at the facility? Just thinking, if it’s a relationship already developed and a space that’s already being utilized and the facility is happy with what’s being provided, and you were wanting to, there would definitely be a way to seize the opportunity to have your own business. But that’s, only if that’s something you’re wanting to do.

> **Response 2:** Hey! We're looking for another PT, if you wanted to pick up hours in Huntley or join us! Or if anyone here knows of any PTs in the Huntley area that are looking to pick up hours! We're in a good spot with growth and are ready to add another PT!

Has anyone enrolled as a non participating provider with Medicare? I want to provide services to Parkinson’s patients and am looking for the best avenue to do so.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I 100% agree with Tony. We also see clients with PD. Hybrid is the way to go.

> **Response 2:** I would tell you that if you are going to the trouble of contracting with Medicare you might strongly just consider being PAR. 
…
NonPAR does offer you a slight advantage in collecting a higher rate from the patient, but it costs the patient more, you are still under all of the same obligations and requirements as being PAR, and in most cases the therapist usually loses the increased income to credit card fees and administrative costs.

I have a patient looking for a cold therapy compression machine for home use. She found some on Amazon but I was wondering if anyone in this group had a recommendation for a specific one? Thx!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got one by polar active - it’s a blue and white cooler. You can get different attachments for it. I found the best method for me post op was to have frozen water bottles that we could switch out in the water instead of having to constantly empty the melted ice/water and refill. I think it stayed colder that way too.

> **Response 2:** Just a tip… if it’s a short term need, Amazon’s return policy is 30 days- my son needed his for 2-3 weeks after shoulder surgery and then was able to return it

Has anyone used or heard of a BEMER device? It stands for Bio-Electro-Magnetic-Energy-Regulation. I'm not familiar with it but have someone trying to sell me one.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes! I use it in my practice.  Get a demo to know for yourself.

> **Response 2:** I have. It is a very low powered PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field) device (although they will tell you it’s “different”) that works best when used for longer periods & frequent sessions. I provide PEMF and other wellness/non invasive/drug free sessions as my full time gig now, primarily horses & dogs (mobile) snd humans (office & mobile as needed). Happy to answer any questions.

First of all, the fact that there’s an ABILITY and AVAILITY is so confusing… I’m using Hellonote so have Ability but finding out that some insurances don’t work with them but will with AVAILITY. Does anyone work with both? Is this common? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yep, it's a bit confusing at first hah. Which insurance are you not finding in Ability? In over 5 years of using them, I haven't had an insurance not be there. You just need to get the PayerID from the insurance

Regarding patients passing away... Do you send the family a f/u survey, requests for reviews/referrals, etc? Or just nah...? I always send a sympathy card. And while what may be considered an appropriate amount of time has passed, it still feels weird. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As someone whose parent just passed away, I would say it’s not appropriate. However, if the family reaches out to thank you, and asks if there’s anything they can do to thank you, then bring up the survey/review.

> **Response 2:** I feel like in that situation, asking for a survey or review is not appropriate and may come off as insensitive.

Does anyone bring a therapy dog or animal to patient’s homes???Those of you that have mobile practices

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had to take my dog out of necessity for a few days to my last patients house (he got hurt and would spend the day at the vet then I’d have to pick him up before my last appointment). They fell in love with him and because of his injuries can’t be home alone for long periods of time by himself so he actually lives with them during the week now and comes home to us on the weekends! This is a long term patient of mine who I see everyday so I also get to see my pup everyday!

> **Response 2:** I have for a client who loves dogs and lights up around them who can no longer manage a dog - but did it on a Saturday session so I planned extra time so it wouldn’t cut productivity of the session. She loved it & my dog was spoiled - win win

Has anyone here offered Consultations with other PTs on cases? 

How did you price and structure this?

My husband gets calls already (from former students) and other therapists have asked if he would. Just not sure how to go about it. 

Picture of our clinics’ good boys for attention.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Anthony Maritato uses some phone or calendar system that when they book through it charges per minute. I can't remember the name or specifics. Maybe he can explain & might be what you're looking for.

Curious how clinicians have built a caseload for a second clinician. I just hired someone, but am having a hard time filling her schedule because most people have been referred to me specifically. Any advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Introduce your referral sources to your new clinician.

> **Response 2:** Your job as a business owner now is to make sure your employee/s are successful. You have conversations with those referred to you that this new clinician is trained by you, has the skill set to help them get better, and you make sure the client has confidence and comfort from you that they are in great hands with your new clinician.

Good Morning!  I’ve been an OT for over 30 years and have been out of practice for about 20 to be a SAHM, but have maintained my license. I’m dipping my feet back in and want to ask what is everyone’s thoughts on using red light and LLLT/cold lasers? What would you recommend for best trainings or CEUS? Does anyone know if it falls under scope of practice for OTs in FL (I’ve looked, but it doesn’t specifically mention it as a modality). Also, if yes to those questions , what products are you utilizing in practice? 
Thanks in advance!

Any recommendations on a reasonably-priced hi-lo table? I use manipulations/mobilizations and dry needling regularly in my practice, so the table should be firm enough for manips but also comfortable for the patient. 

Thanks for any insight!

Curious here. Has anyone ever gotten into offering non-medical services as some component of their business, possibly as a separate business tailored to seniors? I do mobile med B. A lot of my seniors come to trust me, and ask for my recommendations for non-insurance based businesses that seniors use and pay for often. Mostly housekeeping and lawn care services. 

These businesses often have way better margins than PT, I was just taking to one of my patients and she pays $125/week to have her grass cut, takes the guy 15 minutes to do. Got my entrepreneurial wheels turning in my brain, wanted to know if anyone's done this, or if it's even possible?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would definitely have a separate business that does this. For both liability and insurance coverages.

> **Response 2:** I don’t see why you couldn’t. I have two separate businesses…one for human PT and another for canine PT. I only did the human one bc so many of the owners of the dogs I treat requested therapy services for themselves.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have tried a few agencies and they were all fleecing me compared to what I could guess at myself. My recommendation is try to find someone local to you that can trust.

> **Response 2:** Google will work with you and help you set up your own campaign. They will meet with you remotely (for free) to help tweak your campaign and design it with you. I spent about $800/month for 2.5 months and then after that I paused my campaign because I was getting too many evals. That was about 8 months ago. Highly recommend Google ads and asking Google to help you set it up.

***But what do the people say....?***

Are you in the newer phases of your practice and wondering if the UNCAGED PATHWAY program is right for you?

We get it that some can be skeptical of just our word.

Here is what a couple of current students have to say about the program:

"*Having accountability partners and a group around me has given me the confidence to step away from a consistent paycheck... This process has been much smoother and a lot more fun than when I grew my first practice almost 30 years ago.  The game has totally changed since then.*" - Bill J., Virginia

"*I feel like the program speaks directly to the issues that one faces in growing a practice. I look forward to the calls each week.  They are organized in a way that you are learning about a new category of your business each week.  I also love that they include emotional/personal development support to help work through challenging thoughts and fears.  This program is unique, and I highly recommend it!*"  - Christina G.R., Texas

For those who offer wellness visits or things such as stretch sessions, how do you take your PT hat off and “just stretch”? Like, wouldn’t it be important to know their PMH / surgical history etc when stretching joints? But that would then be PT. I want to offer just stretch sessions but want ro go about it the right way. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PT is skilled therapy addressing a specific diagnosis. Knowing PMH doesn’t mean you’re treating a specific diagnosis, or that you’re doing anything with doctorate level skill. It just means you’re using your PT knowledge to provide the best non-medical service possible.

> **Response 2:** I still have them fill out a PMH form! I also have them sign a waiver that says “I understand I am not receiving skilled services, but if the PT believes there is  further skilled need, I will address with my PCM.” Or something along those lines, I don’t have it right in front of me

Has anyone here created a texting package/program?  For advice of coaching of clients?

I have friends and friends of friends asking me for advice and questions. When they write a book and send me a few videos, I can often assess certain things and offer advice or things to try (SLP here specialized partly in feeding therapy). 

How do I stop giving away free services? Has anyone created a package where people can text you during “office hours” for a price? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What problem(s) are you solving for people. Monetize that. I'd consider offering a tiered service with different levels of access to you.

Also it would be considered wellness bc you aren't evaluating them

> **Response 2:** Do an online consulting service. I do it for wound clients all over the world actually. They send me pictures and I make a recommendation and we then follow up through messages

Has anyone ever advertised through a local private neighborhood magazine? It goes to the 5 local high end neighborhoods, 1x/month. It would be a 1/4 page ad and 5-6x/year gatherings. $2000/year. Any experience with this and is it worth it? 
Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes.

Make sure you get an article in it. People will skip over the ad. They’ll read the article.

> **Response 2:** My personal experience, no ROI. Social media worked better. However, I can see if you put a larger more attractive ad and article it could catch people's attention. I was so told that if you have your picture vs logo or texts , people stop and look.

**Original Post:**
Does anyone do exclusively cash based Telehealth?

How well do you find it works?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t do exclusively telehealth, cash based but I think it would be a challenge to get clients. I’m sure it can be done but I’m finding most patients now want hands on (in home or in clinic). Telehealth can work great for many people but I don’t feel
I’d be busy enough if that’s the only option offered.

> **Response 2:** Great question!  Been involved with UNCAGED CLINICIAN for a little while now, just reading and learning from everyone in the group.  This is the direction I want to go in as well, TeleSpeech Therapy exclusively on a cash only basis.  Sounds ideal; however, not sure how sustainable it would be.  On the other hand, this ideal form of therapy, that we are both curious about, would be a great system to incorporate accountability and care giver/family training in.  Cheers!  Hope you figure out how to get to your personal best for you and yours!

My current project is working on a merit-based system for annual raise. Because we pay hourly and one of the benefits of our company is flexible schedule, I don’t want to put so much emphasis on productivity standard (we all hated that working for corporate).

Do not try to sell me any type of coaching call!

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Looking forward to see what others are doing, I’m a bit disorganized. I’ve been using chat gpt to help plan- I’ve created some SOPs to get ready for a possible hire. I’ve also asked it to ask me questions to help me formulate a 2026 plan. Asked some insightful questions, the plan it gave was lack luster but I can possibly try to use it to extrapolate more ideas from the plan it gave

> **Response 2:** I’m part of a group of entrepreneurs from different professions. We meet monthly and help each other with everything from mindset to SEO.

does anyone get calls from companies (not typical commercial ins companies) trying to confirm if a patient has been seen.

Hi, I'm in the final stages of setting up my mobile PT practice. I was wondering what payment terminal most people are using now. I'm looking at square, stripe and clover. Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go through the underwriting at a bank and use clover. May or may not be cheaper, but because of underwriting you won’t have all of your funds frozen if anything raises a red flag (think you sell 3 packages in 2 days vs 1/month). I’ve had a few friends who have had their main source of income frozen for weeks with little to no customer service help with the fast sign-up processors (square, stripe, etc)

> **Response 2:** Square is the best

**Community Responses:**

Good morning!  I have an opportunity to offer a monthly “subscription based membership” to a group of hockey players in my area starting in the fall through spring.  I am struggling with how to structure this from a cost standpoint.  I am comparing it to a direct primary care program but am challenged in how to structure it to make it make sense both from a financial standpoint for both sides.  Has anyone done anything like this and would be willing to jump on a call or message with me about this? Thanks so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do something similar for T&F.  Feel free to message me with any specific questions you have…

To determine the right offer, first consider their needs and preferences. Do you have an idea of what they’re looking for? Understanding if they require unlimited access vs. periodic recovery sessions during that timeframe will help you determine your price.

Anyone have experience with an individual who had top surgery (F to M transition) and is concerned with symmetry? This is a client of a massage therapist I know who asked me my opinion. My wheelhouse would be in the strength training/bodybuilding arena, but other than individuals after mastectomy I’ve no experience helping anyone navigate this sort of thing. Insight is appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You will have some of the same concerns as post mastectomy, in scar amd mobility restrictions. Also body building can be gender affirming care. See what their goals are. Are they looking for hypertrophy of muscles to give a more masculine physique? There are a lot of opportunities to help here with your skills set.

> **Response 2:** Symmetry is a common concern. I’ve worked with post op breast cancer and gender affirming surgery. Edema lasts a long time (6-12 months) Hand dominance is a factor. Agree that body building is gender-affirming and OT/PT can guide safely and effectively. Strength, ROM restrictions & fascial restrictions will be present justifying care. DM if you want to have a more detailed conversation.

Is anybody knowledgeable on the marketplace for personal/family medical plans as a business owner? Curious on if that's a good option for self employment. Turns out I have until the 15th to sign up, so I'm hustling on educating myself. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Marketplace was better than a self employed option for my family. Definitely use a broker . Calling the marketplace I got disconnected twice and they said enrollment could take 2 hours . I sent my tax return to my broker , chose a plan and she did it in about 10 mins . She also handled a problem that arised with the application.

> **Response 2:** Yes we debated between medishare and a marketplace plan.  We opted for marketplace plan at this time.  It's not great but it worked for us currently.  We had an insurance broker help us navigate all the plan options.

Anyone see this product on Shark Tank a few months back? A PT invented it and got a deal with Cuban.  I recently found a promo code for 15% off if anyone is interested to try it out for themselves or give to patients to use.

Since then I’ve been trying to think of something similar PT related that can be turned into a product to help the masses and make more money.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a Pelvic PT, I’m very upset I didn’t come up with the squatty potty which was on shark tank and whose inventors are now surely millionaires. It’s literally just a stool with a cutout!

> **Response 2:** Yes, my husband and son love that show so I saw it, and was curious so bought it. I think it’s weird and doesn’t give me any kind of relief- not enough menthol for my liking. It’s slippery and not the easiest and wears down quickly. I’ll take my essential oil cream any day over this.

I have been full time in my solo, cash based practice for about 7 months in CA. I’m wondering if anyone has any CPA recommendations, specifically who have experience with PT or health care business in CA as it is a little bit of a unique animal out here. I’ve searched the page and found some really good general business/tax advice, but would love to have a pro connection on my side to help me make sure I’m doing everything right and maximizing potential as my business grows.

Thanks!

Has anyone started a Med B outpatient business and then added on a Med A home health practice?

I have a mobile part B practice and I see many TKR and THR patients.  I started thinking, what if I could also do their home health part and then transition into their outpatient part?

Can this be done?  Does it work? Would I need to have 2 separate companies?

(This is what happens when you are awake at 1am!!)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t become a HH agency, rather become an IC and partner with several HH agencies and use their EMR or one that is compatible. So you’d become a “staffing/contract” company for those HH visits then provide your med B practice info as a referral option.

> **Response 2:** Technically you can do it. However, part A home health is highly highly regulated with crazy strict rules. Documentation and billing are very complicated. You would need help. You would need a HH specific oasis EMR, you would likely need a consultant that can help you understand all the rules and regs, if you are not familiar with oasis, I recommend taking a course on the oasis and you would need to hire an oasis scrubber and biller familiar with home health. You would also need an RN. You can't do home health as therapy only. You'd need an admin RN as well as a field RN. Feel free to message me if you have more questions. I was a HH director for years before burning out and becoming uncaged, I know a lot about HH Med A.

Hi all. I’ve been a speech therapist in California for 27 years and recently reduced from 5 days to 3 days a week at the hospital. I’m starting two side hustles, a speech therapy private practice, and for fun am also starting to teach in-home Mat Pilates (certified by BASI). I’m 51 and don’t have big ambitions, I just want to enjoy my work. I’d love any tips to point me in the direction of resources to help me get started. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** SCORE is a resource run by volunteers who have had their own businesses or run companies and they offer free advice, support, coaching, and workshops. May not have healthcare focus, but good at business basics and help with building/marketing. Usually have local offices.

> **Response 2:** For Speech, school based contract and marketing to pediatricians. For Pilates, a lot of suburbia community centers have yoga ans plates classes they offer that their residents can sign up for ..my neighborhood has a year around pilates class.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** I’ve been using Cavicide wipes for a few years, no issue. Can get on Amazon in wipe or spray

Has anyone created a fee schedule for a law firm where you get paid a percentage upfront and the balance due after settlement? My question would be what did it look like and in what form did you provide it? I hope that makes sense.

I’m mobile also if that makes a difference. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Question makes sense and I would also be interested in how others are handling LOP’s.  We quit taking them after waiting for long periods of time to be paid and then only a small percentage of our actual bill.  Wasn’t worth it and difficult for a small business.

> **Response 2:** get paid a percentage of what?  there is no settlement to charge a percentage to the law firm.

I am looking for recommendations to help a patient with protecting her skin/wound with transfers. Patient very large with quite fragile posterior thigh tissue continues to open up when performing transfers such as scooting to the edge and sit to stand. Does anyone have any recommendations as to what to use around the thigh or skin￼ to help the patient keep mobility without breaking down the skin?￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** hydrocolloid bandages they come in sheets and some are cut to shapes just have to find a brand that offers what size you need might have to cut down to size. (usually used for burns but I've had clients with road rash cycling injuries it worked great for healing and pain. Can be left on several days, water proof, flexible and bendy but isn't super strechy)

> **Response 2:** Are you placing a transfer sheet under them so when they scoot you can assist until they achieve the lift and scoot. The sheet would take alot of the friction? Unrelated is her skin fragile higher up? I have had trouble in the past woth gait belts being to aggressive on the skin. I take a sheet and tie it around their waist using a broader contact point to prevent tears

Looking for ideas to help increase knee flexion with swing phase of gait on a client with extensor tone from a SCI. She fell and broke her neck. Fusion at C2-C4. She does have decreased ROM and weakness we are addressing. She loves walking for exercise and would love for it to be more fluid. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When is her tone kicking in? Is she on baclofen or had Botox before? Sometimes a small wedge in the shoe can increase the flexion moment. Or try some KT tape at hamstrings for a tactile cue. Hope that helps!

Hello! I have a patient who is on hospice and clearly they don’t cover for physical therapy. However, pt and family is willing to pay privately. I don’t have have EMR or any other things set up yet. My question is what am I supposed to do for documentations? Not sure how to address, consent form and HIPPA form sign process. Anything else I need to be aware of? Any help or advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks 🙂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have treated many patients on hospice when I worked insurance.  Helped them be as independent and safe as long as possible sometimes until just a couple days before death.  It was always approved by the hospice medical director.

> **Response 2:** PT is covered for people on hospice. As long as the treatment dx is not the same dx that is their reason for being on hospice

Hi everyone, this group has been so helpful so wondering if y’all have some advice. I’ve been at this as a solopreneur for the past year in my mobile PT/wellness business (my husband helps a little bit and does personal training for us too). I’m at the point now where I’m seeing clients 3 full days a week and still do PRN work the other 2 days for two separate companies. My question is when did you all hire help or drop off of PRN work? I’m getting to the point where I have to do admin stuff on the weekends and I’m wondering if hiring a virtual assistant would be the next important thing to do. I’m getting behind on things like superbills, ordering equipment for clients, etc. I’m also realizing that I could pair down on the PRN work and give myself more admin time. I love having the PRN jobs due to the easy guaranteed income but I know I make more and have more fulfillment working with the clients in our niche and I’d likely fill my schedule consistently to a 4th day within a couple months. Any thoughts/suggestions are welcomed!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did PRN for a long time and it was a hard security blanket to give up. If you think you can fill your day yourself, I say “invest in you” 😊

> **Response 2:** Josh Payne Kevin DeGroot David Bayliff 
Y'all have any words of wisdom for this awesome solopreneur?

We keep getting stuck with these awkward gaps that are too short to use. On paper the schedule is full but we lose hours every week because nothing fits cleanly into those spaces. I am curious if other clinics deal with this and what helps.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I booked consecutively every 45 minutes with the only gap for lunch

> **Response 2:** I had this issue when I wasn’t QUITE as busy as I am now. I catered a bit too much to patient time preference vs only offering what worked best for schedule logistics. 

It definitely takes some effort to make a really logistically efficient schedule when mobile is thrown in the mix.  Are you mobile or office based? 

I say you intentionally block the gap with a task that you need to get done! Feels productive even if not generating revenue

I became Uncaged in October of this year and while it hasn't been going terribly it's not taking off like I had hoped either.... and it's put a lot of financial stress on us. I'm now about 8 weeks pregnant and starting to stress a lot over what birth/maternity "leave" is going to look like. I don't want to lose all my clients and have to start from scratch, but I'm no where near consistent enough to hire someone. Any help, tips, etc would be really appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What about the option of being telehealth? Helped a great deal during maternity leave for me

> **Response 2:** Congratulations on your pregnancy and your being uncaged! Is there a PT near you that you trust who could help out with the caseload while on maternity? Some local PTs have done that for vacations. Just a thought.

Any advice on how to convert leads from text messages?

I have two golf instructors who are referring to me in group texts with the potential client. I’ve tried a few different approaches (responding within the group text, messaging directly, scheduling a call etc.) but I am lucky if I even get a text back. If I get someone in person, I feel confident in my skills as a PT to convert but, getting them in the door is where I struggle. I’m not sure how interested these leads are but, this seems to be the primary way I’ll receive leads for right now so, any advice appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'd say if you aren't already,  start developing some social media content and blogs so instead might be able to invite them to get to know you that way and hopefully they'll eventually become a customer. 

Like if them mentioned a certain issue having a link to send them and they say "check this out and if you want to schedule let me know"

Hello Uncaged Familia! 👋🙏🦁 The past few days the theme of fear has come up and felt I had to share this with the group. It can serve as a motivation as we go into the second half of the year and use it in different areas of our life. How are you going to level up and/or find the courage to finally take that leap of faith? 

During today’s episode of Despierta America they spoke about how to conquer your fear when starting off as an entrepreneur and guess what they mentioned?!? It might sound familiar 🤔
👇👇
1. Imposter Syndrome 
2. Live outside your comfort zone
3. Accept setbacks and failures because it’s part of the journey of your growth 
4. Patience
5. Writing down your fears on a piece of paper so you can come to terms with them and then throw it away. This helps you to acknowledge them and to reset your mind.
6. Use your imagination to achieve a positive outlook in your life

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** VERRRRRRY FAMILIAR.

Thank you for sharing, Bryan Munoz!!

**Original Post:**
Almost all of us have thoughts of “What would happen if I had to miss extensive work to take care of my family?”

The unfortunate reality is that very few jobs afford one the time or the ability to be absent for prolonged periods.

Such a situation typically would require the employee to exhaust their PTO (paid time off).

But, what if there is no PTO to take?  Or, what if there is enough to cover only a couple of days?

This can create quite the dilemma and a lot of stress, particularly if that person is the primary caretaker.

I.S. is dealing with this challenge today.

Her daughter and her husband are both battling COVID.  Her husband is rather ill.

That’s not all.  I.S.’s mother has been diagnosed with stage I cancer.  Her father is not in a position to care for her mom.

Thus, tending to the needs of three family members falls on I.S.

Having to care for her own immediate family consumes enough of her time.  Caring for her mother who is attending various appointments for her cancer is a huge heaping pile on top of it all.

It is pretty easy to see how I.S. could be stretched beyond too thin; particularly with a job that shows little empathy for her situation, and demands that she give her time to work.

How would you handle this?

Would you be frazzled? Stressed? Mad? Resentful? 

Probably so.

You know how I.S feels?

She’s grateful.

That’s right. Grateful.

Why?

After sharing the details of her current situation, I.S. concluded with this statement:

“*Thank God I have my own business so that I can have the time to take care of everyone*.”

She makes the rules.

Furthermore, she has attracted a clientele who serves *her*.  They do so in two ways.

First, her clients are who she enjoys helping.  Working with them is fun for her.  She doesn’t view her business as “being work”.

Secondly, they serve her by understanding that family comes first.  They are supportive of her during this time.

In other words, her clients fill *her* cup.

Wouldn’t it be fantawesome if we all could be so lucky as to have clients like I.S.’s?!

Guess what?

We - and *YOU* - can.

The only thing standing in the way of this utopia being a reality is you making the decision to make it happen.

And, you can.

Do you want to be able to create your own job where you can have the same time freedom and flexibility as I.S?

Do you want to work with clients who serve *you* rather than giving of yourself to your limits for seemingly… nothing?

We are here to help you to get started.

YOU having the control begins by clicking on the link in the comments below. 👇

Anyone doing Functional Capacity Evaluations? As side gig/business? I’m wondering about these for people trying to qualify for disability.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in the FL panhandle. I do them as part of my practice. Cash rate is $500 but we charge $1200 to insurance/lawyers (obviously with a negotiated reduction). WC or the lawyer will usually call to set them up once an MD orders it. I pretty much do a general 4 hour one for everyone because you never know what you’ll get into. Tried doing body part specific ones only for them to come in with other body parts affected by their accident that weren’t listed in the referral and screwing myself with pt care schedules after because we treat purely one on one over a 10 hour day. Also most of the time the companies don’t care if they can return to their previous job, just ANY job so the general one seems to be the easiest route. I had considered doing them on the side for awhile, but I had no where to do them effectively. I use WebFCE (not affiliated with WebPT from my understanding).

> **Response 2:** Yes! Great addition to a practice

**Community Responses:**

If you’re in a bigger market you may can go after a 1 on 1 model. Small group is the bread and butter. Useful movement screen and can really help you start to find your niche in the sports performance world .As well just  how important movement screens and assessing, re testing can be.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have deep tissue laser class four as well as a radial shockwave device and have used the focus shockwave device as well. Can give you an overview feel free to reach out and we can maybe talk on the phone.￼

The short answer is, if you wanna start with something I would start with radial shockwave. Go with something namebrand there are a lot of copycats out there. ￼

But I also don’t think of it as a rescue mission for revenue for your practice. You still need to know how to sell the product as well as know what are the best indications to use it for.￼

Does anyone have a quick formula for converting a desired number of patient visits per week to the necessary evals per week to maintain that caseload. I’m trying to work backwards from a goal of about 20 visits a week, knowing I probably see most patients for an average length of treatment of about 8 visits. How many evals a week am I aiming for to maintain 20 visits a week. I know there’s a formula out there for this somewhere. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 80 visits per month ÷ 8 visits average length of stay.  (Assuming 2 visits per week per patient) 
Each month u need to replace 80÷8 or 10% of your caseload.  So if u see each patient ~2x/week than u need 8 evals per month (or 2 per week)  if u see each 1x per week than u need 1 per week. (This would be the math if u are already at 20 visits/week)

> **Response 2:** My math is you need 2.5 evals per week to keep yourself at 20 patients.  20/8=2.5.

I know this is not exactly related to the group, but since people are all over, I wondered if anyone had a recommendation on the best inpatient rehab in Columbus, Ohio for a lumbar fusion? The pt has been having a bit of a rough recovery with the meds all impacting cognitive function. It’s a family member, but I am not in Ohio and haven’t practiced in Columbus so I am not up on the facilities. They are looking at Ohio Health Dublin, Dodd Rehabilitation at OSU and Mount Carmel Encompass in Westerville if anyone has any insight I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** All of these facilities would be great. OSU is aesthetically older but has been around for 60 years. Great nursing care. Excellent physicians that would be great at helping with the med situation. 
Ohio Health Dublin is beautiful but they tend to take less medically complex patients. Mt Carmel is also fantastic, I don’t have as much experience with them. 
If it were my family member, I would try Dodd first and if they don’t have a bed (they are smaller) then Ohio Health or Mt Carmel would be my second choice

> **Response 2:** Hannah Szilagy I agree with Susan DeCelle Nussbaumand Rachel Botkin… all three facilities are awesome. I work in a SNF for last 10 years and we get patients from all 3 places all the time. I also have a mobile Hybrid O/P practice if the patient needs any help in future please feel free to reach out to me.

Hello, I have an opportunity to join a primary care /wellnesss medical office that’s looking to offer PT services. They would pay me per visit 1099 and I’d see patients within their office. This is owned by a PA if that matters in the state of NV.

What things should I take into consideration? I am a little worried about the legality, (stark laws, etc) since they would be referring to their own office/me for physical therapy. Does anyone have any experience on this or currently working in a similar model?

Looking for ideas… my client called me looking for help getting a 95 yr old off a private plane following THA and getting him settled at home. I feel like it could be a lot of liability for a person but I don’t think home health agencies would be open to helping either. It’s not something I’m interested/have time to do but wasn’t sure where to refer them. Any suggestions?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Client using a private plane, that is in need, would get my attention and  concierge service 🤣!!

> **Response 2:** I have a little experience with this as my husband is a private pilot. The patient had mobile outpatient therapy established for pre-hab before the surgery. The plane transfers were practiced in the weeks leading up to the surgery and pilots and caregivers trained. Then on return following the surgery they resumed therapy.

Hi everyone! I would like ask advise. I am in the process to be an independent contractor, NYC area (Bronx). My accountant created my EIN, however the LLC is still not complete due to need for certificate of consent plus the articles of organization. Furthermore, my accountant is on an indefinite leave and out of the country, and I don’t know when she’ll be back. I am lost on what to do next. I came across zenbusiness, is it reliable/legit? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In nys you need to do a PLLC for a PT biz. It takes a lot longer. A family friend attorney did mine. There's a NY PT FB group that might have a referral

> **Response 2:** I used Bloomberg. They did everything. The cost is about 800 dollars btw the fees and what they charge. I tried to do on y own and had it rejected a few times. Too many rules for PLLC in NYS.

Uncaged PTs!! I would love your support and encouragement! I’m really putting myself out there and trying to provide a unique ConEd course! The course is a fundraiser, and all profits will benefit the Long Beach South Bay district of the CPTA. I’m attempting a neuroanatomy course with prosected brain specimens, looking at clinically relevant structures and pathways. How many times have we looked at CTs or MRIs or read reports about different neurodiagnoses? Would you like the opportunity to see some of those structures on actual brains? How many times have you tested smooth pursuit? Would you like to see the visual pathways beautifully dissected? That’s what I’m hoping to provide! Basal ganglia anyone? Limbic system? Cerebellum? I’d appreciate your encouragement…it’s a big undertaking for me. Thanks everyone!!!! https://web.cvent.com/event/3ec6d74f-b828-483b-ae39-2c0a37787226/websitePage:8c7824ea-808e-4723-8496-195f7370f21d

I have the opportunity to sponsor a local cycling team and want to provide some race coverage for them. Nothing much really, just be available to provide bodywork after races, talk about any pains they're having, help tweak their positions, make do some K taping, that kind of stuff. I'm not looking to actually treat injuries at these times, just get them through a difficult racing weekend. Does anyone who has done this have ideas about the legal concerns I'd have here?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just curious: how did that opportunity come about? Looking to get to a similar point one day

> **Response 2:** This is so cool!! As an OT I was just thinking the other day how amazing it would be if a PT sponsored our son’s national level cycling team. Even showing injury prevention exercises and such would be so good! His team travels all over the country so it’s not really a local things as athletes are also all over the country.

**Original Post:**
I have a concept that I'm looking to expand and wondering if anyone has ideas to help. I'm a PT and running coach and want to branch more into running. Often, runners in the traditional PT system don't get coached back to full strength due to insurance limitations, leaving them at higher risk of injury. My goal is to change that by picking them up where traditional, insurance-based PT lets off via running coaching (not PT). My goal is to market to physical therapists more than to runners, to get PTs to hand off clients to me as they end their PT. This gets the runner a better experience in return to run and makes it a smoother referral back to that PT if the runner has a problem in the future, I can hand them back to the PT if they need it, and keep them coached if they don't.

What I'm wondering if y'all could help me on is the marketing to PTs, getting this idea in front of them. What kind of content, collateral, paperwork, proof, etc. would you want to see before handing off a patient to a running coach with PT expertise? And in what format would you best receive the info? In person? Cold email/call? Some type of learning format?

I've already put together some helpful guides for PTs on things like running shoes, patient reported outcome measures, a good running eval, and things like that, so I have stuff to give, but I want to give it in the best way possible. I'm getting long so I'll stop, but thanks for your time!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** OMG this is something I thought of as well! 

Are you self employed at this point or working for someone else? 

And to clarify, you’re trying to see the runner after they complete a return to run and are discharged, right?

I feel like if patients that run know their clinic have a designated run coach, that’s huge PR for the clinic. 
And should you even give those PT related educational content? Because you are marketing as a run coach not PT? And the clinics likely have a cash pay service for when insurance runs out, so your best marketing would be performance coaching for runners who want the guidance of a DPT who can appropriately progress them according to injury history and also reduce recurrence.

I hope that made sense, I’m also learning about all this marketing nonsense.

I think I have more questions than advice 😅 just think you’re on a cool trajectory!

> **Response 2:** I kinda do this in my area. Connections with local run coaches and HS track coaches has been a big referral source for me

Hi friends! This is from a friend from PT school. Anyone know someone good? 

Any recommendations for a good outpatient PT or clinic for a neuro patient in or around Burlington MA.  A friend of my moms has had a couple mini strokes, getting in home care but isn’t liking the company as different PTs come each time.  Her husband can drive her.  Gait and balance are her main impairments.

Thanks for your help.

I have a brick and mortar that I opened recently. I’m a solo practioner but I’m adding to my team (background- I have 20+ years as a therapist in pretty much every setting and have worked my butt off to get here). I had someone reach out who is interested in working per diem/independent. After talking to her for awhile, it’s clear to me that she wants to open her own practice but needs more experience before she can. Basically she wants to use me to get that experience and insight into running a practice. Here’s my question, I fully support people going uncaged- I’m in this group so obviously I love when people have this opportunity. I have a solid caseload and enough connections that I’m not worried about the competition. I’m more than happy to take her on and support her so that she can eventually open her own practice. But on the flip side, how do I make sure I’m not taken advantage of? A ton of work had gone in to setting up my business (forms, paperwork, research, learning how to navigate and use all the multiple billing platforms used by each contract I get, learning which business model to use…). Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have hired people in the past with these goals and always seem to get burned. I’ve pretty much decided not to hire people that are in the process of starting their own practice anymore…. I think it’s a conflict of interest for both of us.￼

> **Response 2:** I worked for another company before I opened my business and was open with my boss from that company about my goals. She was super supportive and I can’t tell you how much I appreciated that opportunity. I worked for her almost 3 years before I left and it was a friendly separation, so it can definitely be done. Our two business now have different biz models and clientele, so I’m not sure how much that played into it. As far as how to not be taken advantage of, my understanding is that non competes are not allowed anymore but could you set goals and expectations? Clearly define what type of things you can teach her but also what you expect from her? Clear communication can go a long way.

Hi all! Trying to decide if I should wait it out or make an appointment for my knee. As of about a week ago my knee started feeling kind of weak like it will just give out but not enough to concern me. Then on Monday I had some pain while working out but the movements that bothered it wasn’t consistent: sometimes flexion would hurt, then other times extension would but pain would be in different areas. Today it felt fine all day and during my workout this morning but now tonight it’s swollen, hurts and feels like it could give out when I stand on 1 leg. Occasionally some achy pain that goes down my calf. Just looking for suggestions, recommendations and if I should go in!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you have a connection with a solid PT who can take a look at you?

> **Response 2:** Hey Michelle! I like to go through potentials whenever I, a family member or a patient is wondering why something is going wrong. 

Let's run through some potentials. Based on sudden onset and no mechanism of injury, we are really left with OA or maybe a bursitis (not super likely though, right?) 

It also does not seem to be following a certain movement pattern (let's start thinking systemic). Gout, septic arthritis, and DVTs are all potentials that could explain your symptoms.

Because you are experiencing: sudden weakness, pain during all motions with no definable pattern, unexplainable swelling, and tenderness into the calf, I would say it is time to go in.

Not much shows up using search tool bar for recent information.  Is Titleist Performance Institute still the best golf assessment program out there?  Those of you that have taken the TPI classes still using your knowledge base?  Do you focus on individual sessions/assessments or do you offer group sessions?  Can you give me a price range that you charge and your geographical area that you are in?  Thanks you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Missy Griem Wilson it’s golf PT 101; definitely good to establish a great base of swing characteristics, common body limitations, and introduce the vocabulary that swing coaches use to help you build credibility with the coaches. 

My golfer Eval is part swing video of them hitting on our simulators, part PT Eval, part TPI Eval.

> **Response 2:** Use it every week. Great, usable information. Once you get passed the first level and get into the various branches you get into the neat and potatoes of it. SFMA, etc. I do workshops and individual sessions. Ask the other Chris Miller

**Community Responses:**

Does anyone use a translation service when they work with someone who doesn’t speak English? Wondering if there’s any service available for smaller practices.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In FL some insurances provide this service through a "language service".

> **Response 2:** My company uses Cyracom which is nice since it offers a good amount of languages. I have no idea how much it costs the clinic and I am with a pretty large company that could probably afford a higher budget for this kind of item. Spanish is really easy and quick to get connected with an interpreter since there’s a lot of availability. Can take up to 10 minutes or so to connect with an interpreter for less common languages such as Vietnamese or Chinese

**You know what turns many of us away from going after something?**

*Work*.

Let's be real. Many of us just don't like working too hard.

You know what else we don't like?

*Stress*.

So, why in the heck would anyone want to start their own practice?

All the work.  All the stress.

*But, consider this...*

Both the work AND the stress are different.

But don't take my word for it.  

Here's what Will M., a recent **Launchpad** grad had to say just this past week:

"*Right now, I'm grinding.  But the work and the stress is so much different than what I'm used to with the J.O.B.  There, I dreaded going in each day.  THIS? I like this*."

One big reason why Will's grind is fun for him is that *he asked for help.  *

He had a program to guide him, to point out blind spots, and to direct him on *efficient ways* to do things.

I mean, if your livelihood was on the line, wouldn't you do the same?

The next **UNCAGED Business Launchpad** starts ***Thursday, July 27.***

Let us help you to not only start and grow your practice...

*let's make it fun, too.*

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a GoDaddy website but use Hushmail for email because it's HIPAA compliant and was recommended by a PT colleague. I love it.

> **Response 2:** I would use Google workspace. It has a lot better anti spam protections as far as sending emails. Go daddy isn't the greatest from my experience.

🙌Are you passionate about physical therapy and your ability to change lives?

•Flexible hours!
•Satisfaction in your profession! 
•Physical Therapist B.S., Masters or Doctorate degree required. 

👉🏼Reach out and send to anyone you know that may be interested 🤝

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This makes me sad to that you are looking only for Masters or Doctorate therapists.  I saw a job posting for a company recently that was looking for a Masters "or better."  How extremely offensive to older therapists who went to school before PTs were required to be Masters/Doctorate level and so they have a "just have a BS."  You could have someone with years of experience with various certifications who could meet all of those other requirements and you aren't willing to even consider them?  You think they aren't smart enough?  Are you being "ageist" and thinking they are "old" and you assume they won't match your "vibe."  Actually, it doesn't make me sad.  It makes me mad.  How rude.  And, yes, I "just have a B.S."

Hello! Posting anonymously because I'm still working full time for a large business, and while nothing I'm doing goes against our employment agreement, I would prefer my employer find out about my side-hustle on my terms. 

I'm planning to dip my toe into private practice one day a week with telehealth and in-person visits available. Cash practice for now, and from my home, specialty in pelvic floor.

I'm wondering what small domain hosting services you all like, with truly phenomenal customer support (website design is not my strength) and what email servicers you use for service communication. 

Seems like there are lots of options, and with chocolate and leggings I know you get what you pay for, but... Is the same true for website and email hosts?

Also if you have words of wisdom, kind encouragement, or don't-forgets for me, I'll take those in the comments too 😄

Thanks a million!

Hi! I have a client whose adult daughter is looking for a one-on-one PT, whose worked with hypermobility. They live in Pittsburgh, PA in “The Hill” area. Also mentioned hip, finger, wrist, and arm pain (used to be a musician). If this is up your alley let me know and I’ll give them your contact info! Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Kelsey Botti at KB Physical Therapy in Murrysville is about the best PT I’ve found in Pittsburgh.  412-3980574.   Not sure how much she does with hyper mobility, but I can tell you she is an absolutely excellent therapist.   ￼ I am a one on one only physical therapist, not in Pittsburgh, but all of my family is.   I have been very frustrated with the quality of therapy they were receiving until we found her.  I think it would be worth calling her and asking her, and I think she would be honest.

> **Response 2:** Hi Allison,
Unfortunately  I have taken a hiatus from practicing and did not renew my liability insurance. I am still licensed but not treating right now.  Let me contact a few colleagues in this area, I’ll get back to you.

My wife and I are both PTs. I currently work in acute care, while she does outpatient for the same hospital system. I am wondering if anyone on here (who is also married and has a PT spouse) started a practice with their spouse and how that went/is going. What sort of setting is your practice, and how do you run the business while having a family? Did you both start it, or did one of you? Any advice would be appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My husband and I just opened a fairly large outpatient ortho, golf, and sports performance clinic with a friend/colleague of mine and his wife. I’m a PT, my husband is not, but he is handling all the back office and billing stuff for us. His background is actually in real estate so it’s been interesting trying to figure it all out together! But honestly, it’s been good! I was a little nervous about working together initially. I know my situation is a little different than yours, but feel free to reach out if you have questions!

> **Response 2:** I know 2 sets of therapists that did this … both couples divorced now after 15 or so years successfully running business. Financial split was messy

Does anyone have experience working as a provider for Washington L&I? If so, I’d love to hear about your experience. Do they reimburse well? How is the billing and reimbursement process? Easy or a big hassle? 

And anyone might know this. I looked up the reimbursement rate for a common code and it said $75. Is that per unit or per session. 

Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

Question, I’m a physical therapist who does wound care. Initially in my practice, we required an order for PT wound evaluation and treatment. It is so difficult to get providers to write that. So we are constantly sending orders back, asking them to be resigned.

More recently, providers are sending orders with our business name, Wound Therapy and our address, ￼￼sometimes even my name. Even though the order doesn’t say physical therapy, is it still a legitimate order because it does say our business name and address? Am I legal and covered if audited? 

Does anyone have any idea?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m an OT who does lymphedema and wound care. I made an order form that all they had to do was check boxes and it is written how I need it written. I don’t know if that would help. Before I got these forms I’d often get PT referrals rather than OT if I got therapy at all.

> **Response 2:** Do you have direct access in your state?

Recommendations for helping to avoid burnout?! Working on setting boundaries and having activities outside of work. But everywhere I go I run into patients, future patients, or providers. I love my job but am feeling constantly needed. I have young kids so I get tracked down at their activities as well in addition to the community pool.

I’m new to my own practice but my family has a very prominent local business. Unfortunately, in a small town and as a business owner, you’re kind of always at work based on my experience.

> **Response 2:** I understand I live in a town of 500!  I have to work really hard at ignoring the late night or early text messages bec everybody already had my personal phone number! So really learning to hold off on looking-returning messages btw working hours….. here’s a funny for you. I had an elderly patient that was admitted to hospital and she called me at 7 o’clock in the morning to let me know she was starting physical therapy that day, but her shoulders are really hurting and she wanted me to tell her what to do for the pain 🤣🤣🤣￼

Got 2 networking folks email me back agreeing to meet up!! But now I have a problem, as I work 830-530 M-F in a clinic. One of them would like to meet and come in to watch a laser treatment thing. 

Does anyone have advice about working around my current work schedule? I'm not allowed to just take one hour off work, I'd have to take off half day and I don't have PTO to use for that, nor will have availability to request off for at least a month. Any suggestions that have worked for others in the past who are working full time still? Idk for sure, but doubt the physician works Saturdays.

Please help this good problem to have!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Did I hear you are going to be sick that day, specifically at ___ o’clock. ? 😂

In all seriousness, as a clinic owner now I would let me staff take an as much time as they need and make it up another day etc. 

When I was a full time employee I asked my DOR if I could take an extended lunch/come in later/leave earlier because I have ______   I was never denied. It wouldn’t hurt to ask even if it is a policy.

> **Response 2:** Maybe try telling the physician that you don't have any availability during the week for the next month or so then ask if Saturdays work for them at all. I switched to PRN inpatient so that I could work until I was done vs a set schedule. It definitely helped during the transition period.

*PEDS*
I’m curious if anyone has experience offering classes or group-style sessions in addition to regular therapy.

Despite conflicting recommendations, I did go ahead and credential with a few insurances (Blue Cross Blue Shield and Medicaid), so I’m wondering what I can and can’t do. I’d love to offer some more broad, cash-based options that aren’t just for my PT kiddos.

For example:
 • Could a “Mommy & Me” style class (tips for rolling, tummy time, milestones, etc.) be considered more of a wellness service, or would it always require a full eval first?
 • Has anyone tried doing once-a-month workshops in other, more rural towns?
       • parent support groups (for guardians  of kiddos with Down syndrome, CP, etc.)? Maybe “support” isn’t a great word, but create a sort of community that is welcoming and helpful. 
 • If you’ve partnered with a kids’ gym, how did you set it up so it stayed more community/wellness focused and not strictly therapy?

I want to make a good business move, but also really want to create community and provide helpful resources for families. Would love to hear if anyone has tried something similar! Thanks in advance!

*cross posted

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In do a gross motor class for non patient families and sometimes graduates attend as well. It's marketed as wellness and if families inquire about any impairment that I would treat, I educate a bit and then tell them I would be happy to do a formal assessment to appropriately treat their child. Families respect that and then either schedule an eval or don't

> **Response 2:** I have offered a few classes- tummy time, motor development fun, and educational classes for parents,  but I never get much turn out- the people who DO sign up love it, and I love doing it. But I’ve decided it’s not worth my time right now. 
I AM considering a learn to bike camp or club for next summer…

Looking to start a half virtual and half in person PT practice in WI and have 2 questions: 

1.  Does anyone have any advice on what the steps are to get started, things to look out for, etc., specifically with virtual?

2. I have patients tell me all the time that I should open my own practice, or they only want to see me, or to refer their family and friends to me…at my travel and PRN gigs (SNF and OP primarily). Is there a feasible and ethical way to offer additional services to these patients after/outside of the jobs I meet them in? 

Thanks!

What is a reasonable charge for wc assessment and write up of LMN?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** $300 is my cash rate for this service. Usually takes 60-75 minutes with all paperwork completed at time of service. But keep in mind this is a covered service if provided to a Medicare beneficiary and is subject to mandatory filing.

> **Response 2:** Curious how this process works as an independent contractor if anyone could give me some insight. I currently work in IPR and complete custom w/c evals and write ups so all MD’s are in house for orders, signatures and LMN. I am starting my PLLC and the ATP I work with has expressed interest in help with w/c evals in rural areas where there are no PT/OT’s locally to do the eval and the patient is home bound, likely Medicare only. After I would complete the write up do I just send it to the prescribing MD for signature or does the ATP? Is it possible to do virtual w/c evals if the ATP is present with the patient? I obviously would prefer to do in person, but I know the ATP’s region is pretty large. Thanks, this is all new to me. I’ve only ever worked in a hospital.

Hey everyone! Quick question. Anyone know if there is a law requiring a landlord to provide handicap parking? Maybe ADA? Does that apply to everyone or only certain businesses? I signed a lease in August and I’m being told I will likely have to wait a year or two to get the parking spot repainted (it is not recognizable, very faded). 
Also, the handicap ramp is about 40 yards from my door. And I have to pay to add a second ramp. Any experience with this? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** i'm in texas and have had many conversations with landlords over the years about this. basically, there is no enforcement of this, and it becomes up to you to either help build, or pay for something, or find a better fit in your lease selection that has ada accessibility already in place. i tried putting one landlord in a manual wheelchair and asked him to find his way to either his vet office next door or mine, he did not appreciate the little task, but i suggested perhaps some of the elderly dogs did not like climbing the stairs to his practice either. print off code/ada/ramp information and try your best.

HSA Cards

Has anyone run into issues accepting HSA cards? Theoretically, we are just out-of-network providers as cash-pay. Just wanted to get some opinions/experience? Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I never had issues and used square. Recently I’ve had issues with the HSA company denying when I swipe, invoice, or manually enter. Typically the client has to call and submit an itemized super-bill then it’s approved. This started in January and seems the smaller outfits not Optum HSA are doing this.

> **Response 2:** As long as you designate yourself as healthcare when you set up, you shouldn't have any issues

Hello and happy Thursday!

Been a hot minute since I shared a helpful guide in here, so today I have one all about **nutrition basics**

Its supposed to serve as a **quick 1 page reference** for the bare bones recommendations for men and women (protein, veg, fiber, fruit)

Thanks to Kaitlin for helping me refine it

Let me know what questions you have :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Nice!

> **Response 2:** What source did you get your protein recommendation values? I have seen such a wide range of numbers from .8 up to 2g per kg body weight. All depending on activity level. And i work with older less active people who want to get more fit so I’m struggling on where to start there protein target and how and when to gradually increase it

I’m getting started on some in-person marketing in my community. I‘m a cash-based clinic in the Chicago suburbs specializing in runners. 

Any tips for meeting with running stores? Current plan was to stop by, drop off my flyers, and give my elevator pitch to any store associate who isn’t busy. If anyone has better luck with a different method I’m all ears, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Nick! We have 2 clinics in the suburbs of Chicago (St. Charles and Crystal Lake) and work with 6 different running stores. I go in a few times a year and teach classes about the products they sell from an injury-prevention view. I initially met with the owners and asked how I could help them sell more products because those types of products (foam rollers, stretch straps, massage balls, etc) are where they have their biggest margins. I didn’t make it about me when I first met, I made it about the store owner’s needs.

> **Response 2:** I emailed ahead of time and said I refer people frequently to get fitted for shoes and would love to familiarize myself with their process. They were all over that and scheduled a time for me to come in!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just have a local shop embroider on shirts I find that work well, I honestly prefer Lululemon and Athleta items.  It is $8 per item to have embroidered locally.  So much better than the typical garments available from the print stores.

If you are talking about items to sell, then I'd go with Next Level

> **Response 2:** We used a local printer and next level apparel. Loved it!

Help- Atlanta area peeps-
I have a family friend who needs some help. She is an active older woman who has a 5th metatarsal fracture and has to be NWB for a few months to see if the fracture will heal.  She also has past history of opposite side knee issues and a wrist issue.

Is there anyone here who could see her in her home. She lives near Chastain Park.

I’m looking at starting video testimonials from clients to share on our social media page. What are a few questions that you would ask that you think would be beneficial for potential customers to hear?

I had these three in mind:

1. Brief intro to why they needed therapy
2. How was this experience different from other therapies
3. What was something they were unable to do before that they now can do as a result of therapy. 

Thanks for any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1. What do you feel are strengths to this therapy experience?

2. Did the skills and or  personality traits that your therapist used aid or limit your experience? (Hopefully give some good personal touches to the interview and insight to the therapists you have as well)

> **Response 2:** 1 what issues were you experiencing before and how did it affect you

2 what results did you get so far and how has it changed/impacted your life

3 what would you say to someone who is on the fence and maybe tried something before without resolve

He’s going to talk to them about it tomorrow, but they’re going to ask cost. Can anyone who does this share what they charge, either per person or flat rate for the company?  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Elsa Lopez is The Momma of this!

> **Response 2:** I use to bill it for my time. Usually one hour on site and one hour for writing up the report and equipment recs. Pretty standard for ergo evals. $150-350/report is typical.

You can get your certified ergo assessment specialist (CEAS) Ceu's from Back School of Atlanta. Easy to do and they put you in a national database to send clients your way occasionally.

⚡ **UNCAGED HACK** ⚡

“Resentment is truly one of the best signals to potential long-term burnout.” – *Hannah DeGroot*

Resentment isn’t just frustration. It’s your body and mind signaling that something’s out of alignment—whether it’s crossed boundaries, unrealistic expectations, or carrying too much without support. 🚨

Instead of pushing it down, use resentment as a **warning system**:
✔ Pause and ask what’s fueling it
✔ Reset your boundaries before they crumble
✔ Take small steps to protect your energy
✔ Have honest conversations with your team or loved ones

Catch our latest podcast episode on how to recognize resentment for what it is, reset your nervous system during the day, and reclaim your joy in both work and life.

👉 Listen to the full episode: [links in comments below]

👥 Share this with a colleague or friend who might need this reminder.

Your success is our success. Let’s thrive UNCAGED together. 💪

Hello! I am curious how many COTAs you think one evaluating therapist can handle before hiring an additional evaluating therapist? Let’s say each COTA wants to work 4 days/week. Is there a recommendation for this or resource I can find more info on this? I’ve checked the obvious like AOTA and some other pages. Would you have a recommendation?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depends on the COTAs skill set. When I worked in hand therapy, the COTAs were very strong. We had a 1:3 ratio.

> **Response 2:** Check your state practice act or see if AOTA has a list for therapist/assistant ratio by state. I know for physical therapy each state is different, some it is a 1:2 ratio, some 1:3, some states do not have a limit, but based on the clinicians ability to supervise the caseload.

Hello! Looking for advice/others’ experience: 

I am employed both through an outpatient clinic & through my side cash-based business. I have provided superbills before from my side biz, and 1 of my clients said that their insurance thought I was in-network with my info provided. 

Does this have anything to do with my CAQH info? I am using POS 11, but just want to make sure I am doing everything correctly on my end. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you have any disclaimers at the bottom of your superbill statement you are not in network and do you have a separate NPI?

Hi everyone! I need some advice on wifi. 

I currently pay $105 for monthly Spectrum wifi. Which seems like a lot to me because I pay less than that at my house where I have Google Fiber which is a better service. 

Unfortunately, Spectrum has a monopoly where my clinic is. I called and asked if there was any way to lower my bill and they said they’re doing a promotion where you get a free mobile line for a year and the Internet bill lowers to $85 monthly. I don’t need a mobile line but they said you can cancel anytime and then the lower Internet rate will stay. They won’t lower it if I don’t sign up for the mobile line. 

Has anyone done this before? It sounds too good to be true so I don’t want to jump to switch and then realize that I was too naive. Would appreciate any insight. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Call and tell them you’ve been having too many outages and it’s affecting your business and you need a discount or you’ll be getting a hotspot from elsewhere (which is an option)

> **Response 2:** Businesses get charged more.  We hear the same thing with our clinic. We also have spectrum.  No other options.   It’s a business expense.

Hello! I’m a solo practitioner, seeing a client for PT, and the family would like to add Speech Therapy. I’m in the St. Louis, MO area (St. Charles). Pt is s/p GSW to head, presents as a TBI/CVA with no verbal communication. He successfully used a Tobei pad while in rehab, over a year ago, but apparently not really since then. I’m seeing him twice monthly private pay to add to what their paid caregiver is doing with him. They’d like to get some help from an ST to possibly try/get a communication board. It’s been right around 2 years since the injury, and family is working on getting Medicare set up. 
Anyone in the area who can help out?

Has anyone recommend/used H Wave (or something similar) while sleeping?

**Community Responses:**

This may be a random question...can we use topical magnesium (gels, lotions, etc.) on patients? I recommend it all the time, and I would love to let patients try it in clinic, but I didn't know if there were any legal issues.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would check your State licensure. CORRECTION: I just read that an Ohio PT gave a marijuana edible to someone he was working with in Wellness. The topical application isn't as extreme for sure. Read my comments below for what happened. Was able to pull up the information again to get specific.  Ohio is really, really strict. Just FYI. I was surprised to see it.

> **Response 2:** As you know it can relax someone so much that they get sleepy. I wouldn’t want the patient driving after that …I use magnesium cream every night on my body a my kids to help them sleep and for best absorption.

Hello! 
What is your opinion on accepting the expedited payment method that insurance companies are sending these days? I almost resent paying the 3% fees to process that payment. 
Has anyone opted out and requested any alternate method of payment? How did it go?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We always call and request a paper check instead. Sometimes when you call they will set up automated funds transfer which is really the most convenient. It saves you the fee and is just a bank to bank transfer from them to you

> **Response 2:** We don't accept anymore. When we stopped accepting we started having them reimburse us 100% of our billed charges

Anyone have resources/experience regarding a non-compete? I signed when I started in 2017 (Oregon). Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** OR used to be a very difficult state when it came to non-competes whether you were let go or resigned.  Legislation changed about 15 years ago with the terminated employees.   Not sure about the resignation ones.   
My point is, consult a resourceful person who knows the law specific to the state.  A bunch of people on FB (therapists or lawyers) stating that noncompetes can’t be upheld isn’t always true.  I know it personally and I was in OR.   
Good luck!   👍

> **Response 2:** Yes it is true that they don't often hold, but consider the size of the company you work for. Large corporations may have the resources and time to waste knowing that they'll lose. The goal in this case isn't to win, but to make your life a bit harder and more financially constrained.

Can someone recommend an automatic blood pressure cuff that is reliable?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I prefer wrist cuffs with loop-through Velcro. Just don’t get one that makes you hold your wrist at a specific height. 

It’s obvious that you need to have it at a certain height but some of the newer ones have a graphic interface that is kind of maddening.

> **Response 2:** I have an omron and tested it at my cardiologist office and it was pretty accurate, within 1-2 degrees

Curious to hear people's experiences with the process. 

It seems one of the possible eligibility criteria is businesses had to have a government mandated shut down. I think PT was considered essential from what I remember and wasn't required to close? 

Any advice appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I really enjoyed finding someone local to me that does screen printing. Most screen print places will put a label on whatever you want, then you’re supporting another local business. Maybe search around your area, ask some other folks that have had stuff made and see who they liked, the products and brands they carry, etc. My local spot has literally any supplier/company you can think of (minus like whoever supplies Lululemon and NoBull, is what my vendor told me) and any product (pens, blankets, bands, water bottles, etc) that I wanted.

Is there anyone who has worked with individuals who have cerebral palsy. Especially, Athetoid type of cerebral palsy. 
I've been working with cerebral palsy children for about 5 months , but I didn't see any progress on their physical or postural problems. 
One of my clients who is a 22-year old has got subluxation of shoulder joints,  but he's able to move his shoulder joints during flexion of his shoulder joint that his head of the humerus in shoulder joints are pulled out. 
I'm kindly looking for something that what strategies do I have to use. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. 

Thanks in advance .

This may be an easy answer but also complicated:

90-year-old advanced Parkinson’s woman with severe end stage OA and contractures/weakness and limitations is still walking approximately one block with Rollator and minimal assistance. She is IND at night with her family next door.  She needs a new bed but doesn’t want a hospital bed. What do you recommend usually if somebody doesn’t like the idea or look of a hospital bed? She needs adjustable frame for head and lower extremity elevation, and a side guard rail which I know I can just order from Amazon. What type of mattress and what type of frame looks the nicest￼? 
I’m sure they can go to sleepys and test out mattresses, but for long term/short term/now what do people suggest for comfort.  (Her OA is polyarticular) gel or memory foam might be too difficult for her to be independent in her bed mobility, but she does need sidelying positions but she also needs to get in and out of bed for independent commode transfer at the side of her bed at night￼

Or should doc order hospital bed and then they get a better mattress?
Thanks !!

Hey everyone!

I'm a mobile cash PT in Wisconsin. I have been approached by the manager at one of the facilities I frequented while I was a home health PT about doing some group exercise at an assisted living 1-2x/week. I've got the time and am happy to do so. 

Does anyone do this? If so, how long are your sessions that you recommend... 30, 45, 60 minutes? What do you all feel would be a fair rate to request from the facility? 

Thank you for your time!
Amanda

Being a leader doesn't mean you stand on top of a mountain and yell down to those hiking and say "YOU CAN DO IT" 
Being a leader means leaving the mountain top to help those on the journey. Because ultimately leadership isn't about you. 
Which is why so few people really want to become better leaders. They want the benefits that often-time are accompanied by being in a leadership position but they don't want the messy-ness and challenges of actually leading. 
Our professions (PT, OT, SLP, Chiro, Massage, etc) and honestly the world needs more leaders. We have terrible examples all around us of "leaders" who are simply using their place of power for their own gain or are afraid to actually implement important and meaningful change. 
We need people to step up. 
Which is why I'm hosting the 6 week leadership intensive starting next Wednesday morning and want you to be a part of it. 
If you're ready to lead comment "READY" below and I'll reach out with more information.

Hi. Curious how you calculate vacation and sick time into your scheduling/paying yourselves? I’ve got 3 littles at home so getting sick is inevitable

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve never calculated it at all. I feel like that’s the beauty of paying yourself. If you have to “call in sick”, it’s only to yourself. My patients all know I have 3 kids, and I am as up front as possible with them regarding potentials for me not being available (school holidays, days off for storms, someone in the house not feeling well, etc). I’ve never had anyone push back on me needing to reschedule because of a kid thing. And as far as paying myself, I pay myself what I would have if I worked.

> **Response 2:** I use a variation of the profit first model. I read most if it and then stopped once I had the general idea so it’s not not necessarily the exact method. It is based off of percentages of the money coming in going into different accounts. The “profit” account I think of as a mini savings account that I pay myself a bonus from quarterly. I will dip into it sooner if I have a slower pay period. 
I inevitably need to cancel folks like last Friday when my youngest was sick I rescheduled what I could and stayed home to snuggle my munchkin. 
I also have much less guilt then when I worked for a big clinic who would try and reschedule my caseload onto my already overwhelmed coworkers. Now I call my patients and they say absolutely take care of your daughter please tell her I hope she feels better.

Was looking at VALD but I’m having trouble understanding how the subscription model is worth the extra price.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A friend used VALD and says their normative data is invaluable to him.  He charged $225 for a force plate and VALD assessment and then shows sport athletes how their numbers compare to NFL players at their skill position, vs. Collegiate, Etc.  those numbers are powerful to these clients.  So unless you can find those normative values elsewhere, he said it pays for itself in one visit per month and that it has added tremendous value.

I am stuck in a sump and need help. My side Biz has been super slow recently after a long travel trip. I had discharged some of the patients before I left and was able to pick up 2 patients after returning. I did call / email some discharged patients to check in but also not getting alot of phone calls / leads either. How can I re-vamp my side biz? I take Medicare only and otherwise cashed based mostly for pelvic health. 

Tried talking to the local senior center about doing workshop / educational talk but they didnt have anything until next year now for speakers. Talking to some gyms to host workshop but nothing yet. My goal is to get 4-5 visits per day for 3 days a week at this time due to other commitments/ kids schedule.  

Help! Feeling low lately 😕

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it’s just a change in season, start of school year, Jewish holidays.  Just give it some time

> **Response 2:** Get to know other PTs in busy clinics.  Most clinics are not set up to handle the complicated patient. You could take that clientele load off of their busy schedules. 
Talk to your current patients and tell them the type of physical therapy that you do. They may know someone who could use your services.

Thank you in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I ran my business out of my basement. We have a walk out basement so they didn’t have to walk through our house, but during winter in had them come through the front because of the cold. Patients were fine with it because of the specialized PT, but definitely need to keep the house clean and uncluttered. Not the ideal situation

> **Response 2:** I see patients at my home. It works out bc I have a formal living room where people can wait in case I’m finishing up and an office, bathroom and spare bedroom (set up as a gym) all in the front of my home so no one has to walk through the rest of my house. People love it bc it’s one on one

I want to send thank you notes to patients who refer their friends/fam.  What HIPAA regulations are there that we need to be aware of here.

For example does "Dear Joe, thanks for passing our information along to your friend John" reveal John's info and therefore break HIPAA - or how else do other folks handle this?

Similarly, what are the rules for thanking an MD for referrals by patient name - or just generic "thanks for the recent referral of our mutual patient"

Pretty picture for the algorithm!

I’m curious if anyone in this group has had any success with procuring grant funding to help establish their businesses. I’ve always considered grants to be for non-profit organizations, but I’m wondering if grants might be available to help start my side hustle business. I’m a woman in rural Alaska looking to expand healthcare accessibility… my husband and I are imagining there might be something out there! 

Right now all of the money that I’m spending to establish my practice is out of pocket which I’m getting thoroughly confused about when it comes to accounting 🙃

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look for grants for rural health services, woman owned business, your local rotary or lions club, your local small business organization.

> **Response 2:** Look up something along the lines of “economic development authority” they may offer business loans for new or established businesses with very reasonable and fixed interest rates that can be forgiven if rules of the loan are met after a certain time period

Hey everyone! Does anyone sponsor an athlete? And if so, did you use a written agreement or is it okay to just agree to sponsor them with “x” amount of money in exhange for your logo on their racing stuff, social media, etc.?

Hello fellow clinicians.  I'm looking to take a certification course in nutrition as I have a Nurse Practitioner coming on board in my space that would like me to have those tools to assist her clients in that realm.  It would be a great match with my ability to help guide with exercise.  A sort of missing piece of our puzzle for holistic care.

I have dabbled in assisting folks with macros tracking over the years, but I need more education.  Any recommendations on a fairly quick and less expensive certification I can take that is reputable?

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey!!!! 
Love this! I have done several different functional nutrition trainings. What type of population are you primarily working with? What are you looking to gain from this? 
Being more clear on your goals will help decide which route to go. Happy to help! Message me. 
And I would love to chat more about the NP coming on board bc I’m looking to do this soon

Has anyone had issues with your business showing up google or Apple Maps? If I type in the name of my business it shows up in maps, however if I type in physical therapy near me my company doesn’t even populate. 
My business is listed as physical therapist primary category, and physical therapy clinic a secondary category.￼ 
However, In a browser if you type in “physical therapy near me” I populate and the top searches. 

I’m not to tech savvy so I don’t exactly know what’s going on here, or how to fix it. If Anyone has an insight into this it would be much appreciate it!

And for a little background information, I’ve been established for a year and a half, I have 61 reviews, and post regularly on Google my business updates. I see companies with no reviews no pictures and self made websites that are popping up and my business won’t.￼￼ 😬
￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same with me too

> **Response 2:** 'Physical therapist' versus 'physical therapy'. I think most people search for the service rather than the provider. Just my thoughts.

As someone who hardly travels, does anyone have a good recommendation for airfare flights from Philadelphia to Denver.  I flew Southwest last time but with their recent holiday debacle little Leary of using them again.  Have an event to go to in February. TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Always search for flights in incognito mode. The airlines are dirty and your IP address can be used against you to hide the best fares if you search again.

> **Response 2:** Honestly while it was a mess I'm still flying them for the flexibility they offer. I also like united because Denver is a hub, but they can be a little more expensive. Also, we lost one of our refineries here in Denver that supplies a lot of jet fuel for DIA so they are projecting Denver ticket prices to go up soon. The nice thing with southwest is you can book and get credits of prices go down.

I’m new to the group and joined because I have been doing research about starting my own in home therapy business. One of my biggest questions/concerns is how to transition from your safe corporate PT job to your own thing. Obviously it’s a risk because patients aren’t guaranteed. If anyone could give insight on how they did it, I’d greatly appreciate it. I was thinking of starting off just seeing a few patients and if i continued to get calls for appointments, drop down to part time from full time at my current position. Thanks in advance for any advice and insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would definitely recommend doing it as a side hustle to start out but also depends on your situation with finances, having spousal or roommate financial support, Etc. Quitting your main job and going full-time into it without any current clients can light a fire under you but also add more stress. Lots of variables to think about

> **Response 2:** just messaged you! each person's financial situation is different so the transition should look different.

I realize that a lot of this will come down to knowing my clientel and focusing on that population: but I was wondering what other people's thoughts were: I feel like times are changing FAST right now:  what goes up must come down:  and so with gas and mortgage rates going up and stocks dropping, and people being more cautious on how they spend their money, I suspect it's only going to get worse... ( I promise i am usually optimistic) but does this have anyone second guessing about insurance and increasing volume of clients? Just trying to plan  ahead and figure out my strategy here...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have been in private practice long enough to ha e lived thru the recession of 08'  My advice would be to position yourself for tough times.  As Patrick Swayze said in Roadhouse, "It will get worse before it gets better"

Hey y’all! So one of my goals for the rest of this year is to create more content to develop into a blog for my website… Which is relatively nonexistent right now😜 

I am not a good writer so I’m going to be just talking into my notes app for various topics that strike me as I’m driving to further develop. Hoping to find someone to do some editing to help me out with that end of it. Do any of y’all Do anything similar or know of any other easy platforms to use or what not?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hire a VA. Let them write it for you. Buy private label rights. You are welcome. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** Keep in mind, these blog posts are not creative writing. Depending on the purpose of your blog it should take little to no actual thought.
...
My blog is to gain traffic. Traffic generates ad revenue, increases the value and authority of my website, and will eventually build an email list that will sell digital content.
...
My blog is not intended to convert visitors into paid clients in my clinic.
...
So knowing the purpose of my blog posts the most important thing is to simply answer questions. 
...
You don't need to be a good writer... I mean you don't need to write well in order to answer a question like "Is it normal for my feet to swell after a total knee replacement?"
...
Everything here is very technical. Use a framework.
...
Choose a keyword based on search traffic numbers. > Identify the top 3 to 5 related keywords. Choose your main keyword and put that in the title, H2, first sentence and last sentence. Then make the next 3 or 4 H2's the related keywords in question format. Then answer those questions in 200 to 250 words each.
...
Take original photos, optimize the photo file name, alt tag, and title with your keyword.
...
Embed video - either your own or someone else's from YouTube.
...
You have done this a thousand times already in your documentation and talking to patients. Turn off your brain and just follow the steps. 
...
Paint by number.

We do all of the developmental postures, pool therapy, isometrics and PNF techniques and rolling. We use NMES (but haven’t on the trunk?) I’ve worked with family on positioning in bed, and in the wc. Just got a new wc within the last year, with trunk support, but we may look at adjusting it. 
Any ideas on what else we could do to stop the progression of scoliosis? Do you think an assessment with a Schroth therapist would be beneficial, if he does not consistently follow commands? If so any recommendations in Phoenix AZ?

Thanks for any advice!

> **Response 2:** Schroth/PSSE is mainly for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Neuromuscular scoliosis requires a different approach. The 3dimensional principles might be applicable when designing a wheelchair support. Custom bracing would probably be more beneficial considering the cognitive impairment.

I am really not liking SOC/Oasis in HH. Definitely need more experience with it but it is really not worth it. Rant over. Maybe.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 10 years of home health here. I loved SOCs. 2.5x the productivity units. When you do great chart review ahead and know your system you can do the SOC in 1.5 hrs . But you have to be efficient and that takes time I’m sure

> **Response 2:** The worst. But I can thank OASIS for forcing me to start my own mobile part B practice 😉

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t own a company like that but my previous employer was all auto. We had 2 PTs and 2 PTAs stacked with patients for the 2+ years I worked there. They had basically the best relationships with all the big attorneys, plus denver is pretty good attracting terrible drivers, lol. Idk about to difficulty but I do know you aren’t paid for quite some time and since we didn’t really have any limits our treatments went pretty far out and were very justified due to some of the injuries. If you have the financials to support the company while you wait then maybe? Our owner had multiple investors with her to offload some risk

Going uncaged in Pittsburgh, PA but have some questions. 
1. Is there a PLLC I need, or just LLC?
2. Do I need a specific business license? For example, I am planning on doing mobile and renting space from a gym. I couldn't find a business license application for this on the county website. 
3. Do I need to register with the department of health? I'm not planning to take any medicare patients. 

I would appreciate any and all help to make sure I'm doing the right things legally! Thanks!

Thanks !

Any PTs in the East Bay CA who have their own clinic and do Medicare part B?
I’d love to broaden my network as a home health clinician. I see many orthos and sometimes their surgery office already sets up their OP PT for them after I’m done, and sometimes not. I try to help them call different clinics around them, but sometimes they can’t get scheduled to be seen till over a month after they’ve finished HHPT. I’d love to help out independent clinicians and also learn how you guys roll!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would say the best thing you can do is have that conversation with them day 1. 

It’s pretty typical that clinics accepting insurance in this area are booked out 1-2 months. 

Did you have specific questions you would like to ask?

I’ll try to be as helpful as I can!

> **Response 2:** What’s your coverage area?

Edit:

 Checked out your profile. Looks like you own a staffing company that covers several counties in the Bay Area. 

Is there a particular region that you feel has the greatest need?

**Looking for Feedback from Clinicians Using Shockwave Therapy Devices**

Hey all...been flooded with shockwave ads lately...considering adding shockwave and would love some honest feedback from anyone that is using. 

🔹 **Focused vs. Radial:**
What are the key differences you've seen clinically between focused and radial shockwave? Are there certain conditions or tissues where one outperforms the other?

🔹 **Device Comparisons:**
For those using higher-end devices (Omniwave, Stemwave, Softwave, etc.), how do they compare to lower-cost options (Shockvitalize, Pervita, etc.) in terms of build quality, results, reliability, and support?

🔹 **Clinical Results & Protocols:**
What kind of outcomes have you seen in your patients? How many sessions does it usually take before you (or the patient) notice improvement? Any general treatment frequency/dosage guidance you follow?

🔹 **Most Common Diagnoses:**
What conditions are you getting the best results with--with either focused or radial? (e.g., plantar fasciitis, tendinopathy, calcific shoulder, chronic muscle pain, etc.)

🔹 **Training/Support:**
Do most devices include training, clinical protocols, or onboarding support? If not, how did you get comfortable incorporating it?

🔹 **Are there any portable units that you've had success with?**

**-Any Regrets or Lessons Learned?**
If you could go back, would you choose the same unit again? Anything you wish you knew beforehand?

I'd really appreciate any insight!

**Community Responses:**

Has anyone ever used a consulting done for you private practice start up service? My friend opened a hair salon and hired a company that helped her do everything from how to record metrics, manuals for hiring staff, the best way to do x y and z. Don’t think it was cheap but there’s just too much to know especially if you don’t have any prior knowledge. Anyone do anything similar for therapy private practice? I found some online, but just curious if anyone has used them. There’s some who just do marketing or just this or that but I’m looking for more a whole package. For example, the hair salon agency provides a spread sheet to record all metrics that shows the hairstylists where they need to be to move up to a level 2 stylist, etc. (amongst many other things)
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve hired a few in the past that were just like solo people but have had bad experiences. Really looking for a large company who has done a lot of them. If that makes sense 🤔

> **Response 2:** I did this as a PT but for software and a high ticket back end offer. 

They're available just have to find the one you want to be coached by

Hey all! Looking for feedback from those who have run successful 1-2 day seminars or mini-camps for young athletes. I have the HUGE opportunity to host my first mini-camp for a group of young skaters early this summer right around when I plan to launch my business. I’m specifically looking for info on: 
-What kind of paperwork and agreements you had in place with the host venue or club 
-What paperwork/liability forms you had for the athletes 
-Any tips on structure, topics, time frames that worked or didn’t work 
-Swag/merch that goes over well with kids 
-What are some realistic perks I could offer for anyone who books an eval/wellness screening the day of, considering I haven’t actually launched yet and that I’ll be working with kids and have a short time to market to parents 
-Any other tips or advice is welcome!  
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Spend the least amount of money as possible on marketing and focus on converting them from leads to actual patients.

Having a hard time deciding between Simple Practice and Hello Note. Hello Note is expensive as far as integrated billing since I am solo practice with only a  few insurance patients.... thoughts, experiences with these 2 options?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve used Simple Practice for a few years and it’s pretty easy to use and the price is great. Only $10 extra for Telehealth.   It isn’t always easy to get questions answered right away. You need to search for the question and then they eventually email you back.

> **Response 2:** HelloNote is pretty glitchy and inefficient. Way too many things to click to get into notes. The 2.0 update made things much worse and none of the stuff they promised have happened.

Recently switched to Medbridge for my HEP software, and it turns out the “create a patient” feature is only available for enterprise accounts with 5 or more clinicians. 

It only provides access codes for each client, without the ability to keep it under a patient profile. Anyone find a workaround for this or have a program they like better? I’ve used physitrack, tried AC health and it wasn’t for me. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have a work around for this for anyone with less than 5 therapists.

> **Response 2:** You could always document the access code somewhere in your notes so that when you want to adjust or add exercises you can search that access code in the exercise builder and keep it in one program.

Hi Uncaged Team!

I started a new mobile practice and just booked my my first workshop with F45! It’s supposed to be geared towards the back, hips and knees.  

I need help with ideas to keep the workshop engaging as well as make sure I am showing my worth. Any ideas? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** D.j. Mortimer congrats! 

Here are my thoughts: People won’t truly listen until you show them that they have a problem. With whatever topic you choose, demonstrate the problem from the beginning. Then, keep it simple! Complex is never better. Your job is to give them an “aha” moment and help them to think differently about their body and health. Then, give them a call to action 👍.

> **Response 2:** Keep it simple. No major ppt slides. Agree to do one body part or theme. I’ve done a lot of these over the years on golf, ergonomics, LBP, knee pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, balance. Ask lots of questions about their issues and give honest answers. Be happy to chat over phone if you want

Looking for a recommendation: Jupiter/ West Palm Beach FL.

I have a patient who is moving to FL soon who is in need of a special PT who works with a lot of chronic pain. She is quite centrally sensitized, and has a lot of nervous system upregulation that contributes to her pain. Neck, shoulder, back. She is a very compliant and hard working patient, but needs a PT who will not have a "pain and gain" mindset and will be slow and gentle with her. Bonus points if anyone has access to Redcord.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is my specialty... if she's willing to drive up north to Gainesville for monthly appointments, I'd love to help. And be accessible via email/phone between sessions. Reframe Rehab & Wellness, LLC

Mobile cash based PT practice owners-
How do you’ll share your initial evaluation or progress reports to a patient/family member on request? I use JaneApp and I see the ability to convert any note/report to a PDF format and email/print. I’m just wondering if you’ll have the patient/family member sign off on some kind of document prior to releasing their lwn medical records to them? Btw, I’m in a direct access state (not sure if that makes a difference?)
Thanks!

BFR.....anyone used the smart cuffs? How are they? Differences in the varying machines. Any input as to which ones to invest in? I don't have 5k to throw at the delphi version. How does the Smart Cuffs Pro compare to the Delphi?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have used both options. Where I currently work has the smart cuffs and they’re okay- not as wide of a cuff which can be less comfortable compared to Delphi cuffs. Display is smaller and buttons are less user friendly on smart cuff. I do like having the option the go unconnected to a machine when they’re doing certain exercises. 

Delphi over time loses battery life to where it needs to be plugged in constantly after 2-3 yrs of use. 

Random pros cons list but hope that helps!

> **Response 2:** I've never used the Delphi, but I love my smart cuffs!

Texas PTs: I'm looking for Con Ed course in differential diagnosis. I am a Master's PT practicing for 18 years. To fall into the treat without referral under TX practice act, the board requires differential dx CEUs. When I contacted the board for guidance/info, they simply said it could be broken down from previous courses or a stand alone course. I'm sure somewhere in my 18 years I can gather hours of differential dx, but I'd like a stand alone course to help "cover" that. Has anyone taken one they would recommend?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I took online from HomeCEU and is was straight out of the text. I did the 30 hours in about 5.

> **Response 2:** If you are not looking for a live course, I have taken some on medbridge. I just chose what I was looking for to get the hours I needed. I believe there is enough to get your 30 hours there.

**Original Post:**
I have a PT who just became pregnant! Awesome news.

And I am just now realizing I’ll have to figure out her scheduling with her patients and such.

How the heck do I go about doing that with her current patients? It’ll be fine with not putting new patients on her schedule but what about her existing patients? 

Because I offer maternity leave for 4-6 weeks. So assuming she takes all of that, I want to plan it out so her patients don’t get dropped.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** While pregnant and when my staff became pregnant, I stopped giving evals when they hit around 30-32 weeks if they planned to work until they deliver. They would only see follow-ups and Wellness visits. Start thinking about hiring coverage for her leave if you want to keep the patient census at the same level. Also, know that she may choose to take more leave that would not be paid as a benefit and/or use her sick time depending on how you handle benefits. If so, anticipate that she may be gone for closer to 8-12 weeks. 

Also, think about what her return will look like and how you can support her and think about things such as support to help her navigate the transition to working with children, breastfeeding, etc.

> **Response 2:** Also, and I don’t meant this rudely, but just ask her, and then keep asking her along the way ❤️

I would like to hear about the impact of pro bono work on business development. I am starting a private speech therapy practice with emphasis on transgender voice. Therapy will be remote/telehealth, and I’m talking with a community center that might let me use a space for in-person evaluations. I’d like to offer something to the center and community, like group sessions for voice practice once or twice a month. I want to offer something valuable, but not so much that it diminishes the interest in private therapy. I’d love to hear any insight or suggestions. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Awesome! The biggest piece of advice I have is resist the urge to give them EVERYTHING in a class setting.  Educate them on why/when individual sessions are needed

> **Response 2:** I do pro bono work 1x/Mon. All it does for me is spread WOM referrals. People need PT more than 1x/Mon so it gets people to me and then more trickle in. 
Also kudos for helping expand aide to transgender individuals in an ever worsening anti-queer time.

Quick question to those using AI for their notes: How does it know what exercises or manual techniques you’re doing? Do you just dictate that? I’m curious about it but I don’t know how it would help if I’m dictating everything instead of just typing it. Thank you and happy Friday!

**Community Responses:**

I have some questions for anyone who would like to answer...

- When working full time for an employer, how did you first start out on your own? Nights and weekends? Did you cut your hours back? 

- Did you treat the same population as you were already seeing in clinic - and did you have to let your employer know you were doing this? 
Did they see you as competition? 

- Did you do mobile or rent a space? (Is "concierge" the same as mobile? 

I am a new grad and will begin working in July. But I do plan to go out on my own eventually. My husband and I are thinking 2-3 years. But I am contemplating going ahead and getting started and busting @$$ to get these student loans knocked out before going full time in my own business.

Thoughts? Advice? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

Has anyone used shockwave device for ED and would have a protocol to share? I am getting a device to try for 45 days but the company says they can’t give a protocol for it since it is off label use.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks for bringing up this important topic. When considering shockwave therapy for ED, it’s essential to understand the difference between focused and radial shockwave technologies. I don't know what device you are getting for the trial period?

Focused shockwave therapy delivers energy deeper into tissue with high precision. It operates with a rise time of less than 10 nanoseconds, which is a key factor in triggering biological effects like neovascularization, as supported by research in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Radial shockwave devices, including those like SoftWave, stemware, Omniwave, Hwave, etc., have slower rise times and lower peak pressures. These systems disperse energy more broadly and do not penetrate deeply enough to reach the cavernosal tissue involved in ED as effectively as focused devices.

That said, I want to be clear that I am not criticizing any particular device. This is purely my experience and personal opinion based on years of using both focused and radial technologies. Please make informed decisions, especially when considering off-label applications like ED treatment.

It’s also important to note that ED treatment may fall outside the physical therapy scope of practice in many states. Always check the FDA 510(k) clearance, technical specifications like peak pressure and rise time, and be cautious of marketing claims.

Here’s a helpful article comparing focused and radial shockwave for ED:
https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/trial-compares-shockwave-versus-radial-wave-therapy-for-erectile-dysfunction-in-prostate-cancer-survivors.  Also, find the ESWT Guidelines here ( Page 103 for ED )   :https://shockwavetherapy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ISMST-Guidelines-for-ESWT-_-engl-20240103.pdf

This is a new one for me. I am mobile med B and cash only, solo provider. Got a voice-mail from a perspective patient- was an MVA. Per the patient, his case is "settled with State Farm and he is approved for 8 weeks of PT in his home or a clinic" 

I've never done an Auto- is this something I can pursue? I've never seen one before.

What questions should I  ask when I call him back? 
It's a pretty rural area, I think I'm the only one who does home visits at all in the area. 
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are all amazing- appreciate the assistance.  Patient misspoke on the phone, case is most definitely still open.  Confirmed with PIP adjuster today, filling out auth paperwork now.   Adjuster said claims will be approved and covered, but not taking her word for that 100%- so had patient sign guarantee of payment form and he is self paying until State Farm pays, then I'll reimburse.

> **Response 2:** Ask to speak to his adjuster and get the approval from them. You can ask about the fee schedule and how you should submit claims.

For those with a brick and mortar location...
Can anyone speak to their experience on using (or not using) a broker to negotiate their commercial lease? This is all brand new territory and don't want to make a mistake by not using one!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For me having a good broker or not did not help me in negotiating my lease, but having a good lawyer really helped. 
The broker was just a middleman when I was negotiating my lease. I think if you do market analysis and see all available spots in the area you will be able to negotiate fairly. I would encourage you to go see every available space in the area. ￼

> **Response 2:** I own the property and lease it back to my therapy company. Even then we are required to assess fair market value.  Research your market yourself for fair market.  An agent could possibly help you assess comps. I most markets commercial is not very negotiable because fair market is set.

Hi everyone, I wanted to know what 'icing' machines American PT's are using post-operatively please? We only have the Game Ready machine here in NZ but I want to know what else is on the market. There are huge waiting times here to get one and feel there's more out there! Looking forward to hearing from you all. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have 4 gameready machines.  

Recently for 3 other clinics bought thermex.  A lot easier as requires no ice.  Plus can do hot and cold plus contrast.

> **Response 2:** When I had a massive knee surgery, I bought an off brand machine that I ordered from Amazon. It was maybe $250-300, and worked great. We used frozen water bottles instead of ice in the water, made it much easier to swap them out when needed. It lasted a couple years before it finally bit the dust.

Posting anonymously because truth be told I feel like I should know this answer. For those that treat patients who also receive dialysis how do you structure your schedule?

What I mean is- when I used to work in a SNF, we often attempted to see patients before they left for the day even if it was for an abbreviated session.

But now that I see patients in the home, I'm wondering if seeing some of them in the morning before their session would be too much? I currently have a few patients who all have dialysis on the same days- MWF.

There just aren't enough hours on Tues and Thur to accommodate them all in and I'm wondering how to structure my schedule. 

Any thoughts or ideas?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I also treat by their preference but it is almost exclusively days where they do not have dialysis. I don’t believe there is a “right” answer so that’s a fair question.

> **Response 2:** It really depends. I usually schedule them on the days they don't have dialysis but recently I have been working with a patient that prefers I be there the day of, before their dialysis

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Moving into an office with a chiropractic colleague, this week! Different businesses, same door. I think it’s going to be a great collaboration.

“And sometimes a better solution, or the question to answer is ‘Who can do this’ rather than ‘how do I do this?’ If we’re always trying to figure out the how, and we’re always trying to do it ourselves, then that could be…robbing us of that time that we crave to perhaps spend with ourselves or with our families.”

*Reposting not anonymously* 
Hi, question.

I’m essentially a concierge outpatient PT in a very upscale ILF/ALF. I do all of my treatments in the patients apartments and have a small office in the building to store my stuff and do paperwork. I currently work for a contract company. My question is basically revolving around how to transport my equipment around. I usually just carry a few things in a regular Tote bag, but that’s not working well. The facility has a few flat shelf utility carts available, which are nice, and have offered to purchase me something specially for me, since my contract company won’t. 

Here’s the question: what do you use or wish you had to transport your equipment around within a facility?

Equipment: ankle weights, bands, aerobic exercise step and  risers, air-ex and other balance pads, cones, mini hurdles, etc. I also have a Virtusense that wheels around too, which is nice.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can using a rolling luggage bag to carry heavy items. Not sure about carrying virtue sense to each patient though. 
Save your back!

> **Response 2:** can you leave anything in anyone's apt? I make my patients buy their own theraband and ankle weights from amazon; I use steps in the stairwells for all types of step ups and step downs and "gait / stairs training" I stopped carrying cones and use objects in their home (paper towel roll, books, tissue boxes) to step over.

✅ Being REQUIRED to see 12 pulse people a day and multiple people at one time. 
✅ Feeling like a corporation or insurance company can be dictating any aspect of their care. 
✅ Feeling burnt out of a profession they were once passionate about. 
✅ Wondering if they were able to give all of themselves to EVERYONE they saw that day.

When writing thank you notes to your patients after discharge, what are your thoughts on putting your business card in the note?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As Eric Schneider said: “Nope” 

Thank them. Period.  
This makes the jester more authentic, and demonstrates your genuine care for them 

Including a business card speaks of them being viewed as a transaction, and the motive being only about more business - and not about the relationship

> **Response 2:** No. I have a rule that I don’t give out cards unless people ask.

What have you all found as the most beneficial way of working through an orthopedic injury on top of the client having post covid fatigue?

Hoping to hire someone soon and want to be prepared and get my systems in order. Also looking for best two way communication but trying to avoid a mess of emails (anyone use asana, monday, or something similar)? thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am a virtual assistant who works primarily with PTs and OTs, and I swear by clickup. Great program and very easy to keep a pulse on everything both  for the clinicians and myself.

> **Response 2:** Google workspace + asana, Monday, or clickup (take a look and just see which one works better for your brain). Training will really just be you going thru your systems and what you need them to do.

Hi! Does anyone do online coaching or consultations on top of their mobile cash based PT practice? If so how do you go about separating the two or distinguishing the two from one another on their websites? 

Also looking to get help with an LLC in NH. I know I can do most of it myself but I’ve been told in the past others have hired someone to help them obtain one/ go about the process.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do. It's just listed as separate services on my website. And I talk patients through that if that's what they want or if they are too far away for me to go see them then we just do a virtual visit.

As far as your LLC it is super simple just go to your Secretary of State website and follow the instructions. Just make sure that your state allows you to have an LLC. For example in California here we are not able to do that

Does anyone do pro bono work? I will be the owner of a cash only practice, and want to be able to treat some folks who don’t have the money to pay the full price. I’m looking for guidelines on how not to discount everyone, and to limit the number of people I am discounting at a time. I am assuming that I need to get information about their Income etc. but does anyone have anything else they do or ask, any policies to share or any other advice or wisdom? Thanks in advance￼￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We allow a certain percentage of our caseload to be for probono work at the providers discretion. We don’t crunch numbers or use poverty. Works for us and what we are going for as a company. It shows our clients we truly care and it’s about them, we aren’t trying to hit them with another process.

> **Response 2:** Hi ann, I do, I think there’s a poverty sliding scale online you can find to calculate that way. I haven’t started to use it as the pro Bono ots I have now I know we’re on charity from the hospital that referred them to me.

🔥 Feeling burned out as an OT? Like you're just a cog in the healthcare machine instead of the impactful provider you trained to be?

You’re *not* alone—and you’re *not* stuck. 💡

In this week’s episode of **Uncaged Clinician**, we sit down with Lesli Jenkins, an occupational therapist who broke free from burnout and built a successful mobile lymphedema/oncology practice in the Fort Worth-Dallas area.

Lesli’s story is REAL, relatable, and ridiculously inspiring. 💪
She shares what it took to go from disillusioned to thriving—and how YOU can create a business that reflects your values, skills, and worth.

🎧 In this episode, we dive into:
✅ The harsh reality of burnout in OT
✅ Why so many OTs feel like outsiders in their own field
✅ The *entrepreneurial superpower* most OTs don’t realize they have
✅ How Lesli built her mobile practice from scratch
✅ Collaborating with other healthcare providers while staying true to your OT roots
✅ Encouragement for clinicians ready to take one bold step toward freedom

💥 As Lesli says, “You have the ability to create whatever environment you want to thrive in.”
Let that sink in.

This episode is a must-listen if you’re ready to take your first (or next) step toward owning your time, income, and impact.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Delphi/Owens are best. Saga is a close second. I’ve been impressed with them for the price point compared to Delphi. 

Not as cost prohibitive and All app driven so patients could potentially get their own for home use.

> **Response 2:** I would advise against Saga. Their customer service is horrible and they don't allow any refunds once ordered. I contacted them to cancel my order before it shipped and they refused to cancel and told me I could return it once I receive it. I then asked what the return process is and they told me I couldn't return it. Looking into Suji now.
Just curious, what don't you like about the smart cuffs?

Does anyone have recommendations for disinfectant wipes that are gentle on the skin?

I have a booth at a 5k this weekend & will be using normatec compression boots with the runners. I need something strong enough to disinfect the boots after some sweaty legs, but dont want the next person’s skin to be irritated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I recently used Normatecs at an event. I had people towel off & offered baby wipes for them to wipe down. But still used my SaniWipes for disinfectant (not "gentle" necessarily. But the baby wipes helped with the sweat factor prior to use

> **Response 2:** I use Lysol wipes on all of my equipment (PEMF, red light, etc) - anything with bleach will degrade soft(ish) surfaces over time. I do my best to make sure there is adequate “wet” time so usually have to use a couple wipes per cleaning.

Hi all! 

I’m looking for guidance on how to expand my current mobile pediatrics LLC in Illinois. I run this business with one other therapist Lisa Beisiegel and we are potentially looking to add other therapists (potentially PTs, OTs, STs as contracted providers). We have been accepting BCBS and offering cash pay options, but would potentially begin accepting other insurances. We use Hellonote and quickbooks and otherwise keep things pretty bare bones currently. I’m curious what things we need to know in order to expand our business. I feel like we don’t have a great grasp on this, don’t know what we don’t know…, and dont know where to start. We are trying to decide whether we just need to better educate ourselves, find a mentor, or hire someone to help. If we hire someone, who is that person? Thank you all for the help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look into early intervention services, although I'm in a different state, it's a federal program. I get most of my referrals thru them. You can also look into extended care facilities for medically needy kids. Seems like you have your logistics in place and need to establish a good referral base. Best of luck!

> **Response 2:** A good CRM has made a huge difference in my office.

Does anyone have any recommendations on courses or individuals that can be helpful on making the transition to doing your own billing? Thanks for your help!

Hey!

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to measure quad and hamstring index with a patient virtually for a 12 week post op ACL? I know it’s not ideal but it’s the situation we are in at the moment. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Use a portable weight scale

> **Response 2:** Curious to know what the purpose of doing that testing is at this time frame since it shouldn’t matter for return to play or treatment decisions at 12 weeks but… you could have them do estimated 1 rep max testing using the appropriate machines and calculate the index that way.

Posting anonymously because I feel like I should know this answer and can't figure it out. So slightly feeling dumb. But for those who use Google workspace - and sign the BAA for hippa compliance, do you then have to resign it when you sign up for Google voice (paid version). 

Also once the BAA is signed does this allow for text messages to be sent as well?

I tried searching this group and the Google Workspace (formerly G-Suite) for Therapists Users Group and I couldn't find a straight answer so anyone that can help, I'll greatly appreciate it.

Also if it's not compliant, what are you using to text patients?

Thanks!

Hey everyone! Looking for some advice. 

I don’t plan to open my own practice until next year. I had a current colleague reach out and ask about me training his daughter once weekly in a gym (introducing her to equipment, getting her started on a weightlifting program). She is a teenager, no prior history of lifting/athletics. They don’t have a gym they currently attend but I do have a gym at my home (not sure that’d be the best option?) 

What liability do I have here? Do I need to have them sign a form stating I am not acting as a Physical Therapist during our sessions? Charge cash? 

Looking for some advice from someone who has done this!

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you’re bringing someone into your home you should technically have liability and general insurance so that if someone were to get injured on your property you’re covered. 

Can definitely take cash
You could have them sign something that says you’re acting as a wellness coach instead but I don’t know that it would really matter. Especially since you don’t currently have a PT business. (Not an expert - just my two cents). Some of the more experienced practice owners in here may have more advice.

> **Response 2:** Technical and legal answer would be to have full liability insurance and get consent forms- especially working with minors. To have full self-employed liability insurance will run you well over $500/year, so just that may even be hard to justify. 
So the bad advice option would be take the cash, operate at your own risk, don’t do anything dumb.

Is there anyone here who teaches ASL or is a part of the deaf community? The reason I'm asking is that I'm looking to collaborate with you. 

I specialize in Rebound Therapy, which is quite similar to therapeutic riding. The main difference is that instead of using a horse, we utilize a trampoline to help clients achieve their functional and recreational goals.

Now, here's where I could use your expertise: I integrate communication training onto the trampoline using basic signs. I want to make sure I'm teaching the signs and communication skills accurately. Additionally, I need guidance on teaching signs like "trampoline," "jump" (I've got this one covered), "seat drop" (currently using "sit down" and "stand up"), "tuck jump," "straddle jump," "pike jump," "parachute," "half turn," "full turn," "doggie drop," "belly," "lying in supine," "forward roll," and "backward roll."

My goal is to be inclusive and ensure that trampoline activities are accessible to all. Thank you for your support and expertise!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m the PT at a school for the Deaf. I don’t sign most of those words but I will ask our interpreters.  I usually sign “jump” and then demonstrate with my fingers what I want body or legs to do (if that makes sense). You’re welcome to PM me!

Is anyone using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in their clinics? 

I'm in the very early planning phase of starting an outpatient Neuro focused practice. While going through an NCS prep course, I heard about TMS for CVA patients for the first time and then read some exciting research on the topic. Apparently there are quite a lot of applications for the modality.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** TMS research was my final research project for PT school about 5 years ago. It was one of the first of its kind—Stacey Dejong from the University of Iowa was the head of it and has published some since I believe! I would Google her name with TMS; she is an incredible lady!

Also I remember the equipment was very elaborate and the person had to have imaging to map their brain first, then we could align our “map” for each cortex (with the head piece they wore), to ensure we were at the exact region of greatest motor evoked potential for the upper limb. It was extensive and time consuming but awesome! Unsure if they’ve progressed this since to optimize positioning and make it more clinic friendly

**Original Post:**
Just curious if anyone is doing something like this.
I am an OT and have a neuro patient who is having motor planning, sequencing, planning difficulties. This translates to dressing.
We went in her closet and it makes no sense and is not practical due to her cognitive changes.
So we reorganized completely, went through everything and donated what she didn’t want, and then made the closet make sense for her based on her neurological conditions. I then made a sign that was the sequence of events for dressing to improve efficiency in the closet. She says she is scattered and overwhelmed so we are trying this to see if it helps.
I know there are specific closet organizer companies, but this is not just cleaning up.
we pair together her going out clothes, Exercise clothes, have all her things within reach once she is sitting, tons of organizing and planning prior.
So it’s much more than organizing a closet. It took like 2 hours and we still aren’t done.
I felt this was a very interesting niche and super targeted market.
Anyone doing anything like this?
Of course this person can hire an aide to get her dressed, but her husband and her don’t want to lose independence if they can help it. The husband said “this was the best thing you’ve done all week”
Anyone doing anything like this? OTs?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m an OT and when I worked in an independent living facility I helped the residents with this all of the time. 

You are truly using and implementing your most therapeutic use of self 🥰

Some things I also did:
-hang a “hanger off of a hanger” if that makes sense, to make things easier to reach
-let them make a “get rid of, maybe, and keep pile”
-shoe hangers for behind the doors
-visual reminders 
-laundry baskets with lids were nice for a boundary of overflowing clothes

> **Response 2:** Great idea!

Hello, is there anyone from California who can help me with some information? 

I recently started my side hustle and have found out for every city that you travel to needs a business license(out of city). 

Part of last year I got licenses for 3-4 cities and treated patients in just that area. But there are times where I have only one client in a particular city. How do you manage such a situation? The fees for business licenses are anywhere from 80-200$ per year and the hassle of keeping all this updated. 

Do you wait until you get your license and then treat the patient? 

I have a potential patient in Atherton and not sure if I can see him as I do not have a business license for that city. 

Any insight would be helpful !! 

Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is a problem for many mobile services, from massage therapists to food trucks. I don’t have a solution other than to lobby your legislators to change it. Georgia finally did for food trucks at least this year. Not only are there cities wanting licenses, but counties too. It gets expensive. When I did mobile massage therapy (pre Internet days) I got one local license and skipped any others. I had no problems, but I’m not advising to do this.

> **Response 2:** Thank you for your reply. It’s a pain for sure !

I think having an accountability partner would help!

One person or a small group where we do a weekly check in by zoom or real-time chat for 5 minutes.  Set out 3-5 things you want to accomplish - the next week (or end of day by email) we report, did you do the things?  Ideally for me the check in would be a Thursday or Friday afternoon (east coast time).  Anyone want to try this with me for a month or so?

If this already exists, point me there!

Hi everyone, looking for some clarification: 

Therapy recertifications need to be done every 90 days correct? 

And then for progress notes it’s every 10 visits or every 30 days whoever comes first? 

I’m located in Florida. 

Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not an expert but that sounds right. I do believe that Medicare is actually every 10 visits though, regardless of 30 days

> **Response 2:** Definitely read CMS as Sue suggested but you set the length of the plan of care when you write. For example I had a patient I thought would only need 8 weeks so I set my POC for 8 weeks. She had a bit of a set back and needed more time. I needed to recert at the 8 week not 12 weeks. Hope that makes sense?

A journalist reached out to me today and left a voicemail asking if I would comment and give her research articles to confirm a story she's working on.  Um...does anyone have experience with this?  Any advice or precautions?  I don't want to miss an opportunity out of over caution AND I could see this going sideways.  She did say a line of her story that I don't agree with, so not sure I want to get involved.  TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would at least talk to her about the story but make sure you say your first convo is off the record so you can get an idea about what she’s going for. Then make the decision. You could use your expertise to sway the story. But in the end if it’s not a good situation then don’t put your reputation on the line.

> **Response 2:** Always ask what organization she is representing or writing for to make sure she is legit. If she has an email that is gmail, yahoo, and not ‘organization’ related she could either be an independent journalist or it could be a scam just for her to pitch her ‘marketing company’ to you. I have had that happen to me a few times. If they were an independent journalist and I looked up their name it was usually some marketing thing they were trying to promote for themselves.

I’m just launching my website. Trying to find the best way to incorporate an email campaign and which provider to use for that. My question is about privacy policies. Is anybody using one this early on?  I’ve looked at several sites that don’t have one. What is the risk of not having one this early on, and when should I get one? TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Re: email. I use mailerlite right now. The free version.
It’s exactly what I need without paying extra. It also has landing pages.

> **Response 2:** 💯 you need a privacy policy. You can get them free even. Without one, Google will not like your site for searches. 
For email I always recommend convertkit or activecampaign, but if you need something cheaper but still good- getresponse is good.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

Needing help or advice on getting medical benefits for employees. I'm a small pediatric private practice in Austin Texas.

I currently need some form of medical benefits for one employee now and for another one starting in January. Does anyone have any thoughts and suggestions on plans or providing a stipend for a health￼share?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would start with offering supplemental benefits, like accident/injury, hospitalization, short-term disability, major life event. The two big companies that handle this are AFLAC and Unum. I am personally an agent for AFLAC because AFLAC is the only company that covers mental health hospitalization as a hospitalization as well as as For a short term disability due to mental health reasons etc. also, AFLAC is the only supplemental health plan that pays out for hospitalization. As long as you are in the hospital for 18 hours. Every other plan is 24 hours. This may seem like not a big deal but I was actually once hospitalized for 23 hours and I went to submit my claim to Unum and it didn’t qualify but it would have if I had AFLAC. And that’s $1000 difference.  Otherwise every state is different as far as insurance is concerned for health sharing plans. Otherwise look into QSEHRA (Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement)

> **Response 2:** I have a local friend who does the is for companies. I can message you his info if you want.

💡 **Burnout Doesn’t Happen Overnight** 💡

Running a healthcare business is rewarding — but let’s be honest, it’s also demanding. Patient care, staffing, finances, regulations, and the constant push to innovate can take a toll.

If you’ve been feeling exhausted, detached, or wondering why your motivation is slipping, you’re not alone. These are often early warning signs of burnout — and ignoring them can hurt both you *and* your business.

In our latest blog, **“Recognizing Burnout as an Entrepreneur – and What to Do About It,”** we’re breaking down:
✅ The signs of burnout you should *never* ignore
✅ How to reset boundaries and rebuild your support system
✅ Ways to prioritize your health and reconnect with your “why”
✅ How to make small changes that protect your energy and fuel growth

You don’t have to “power through” burnout. With the right steps, you can recover, thrive, and lead your business with clarity and energy. 🌱

🤔 Many of us have tried traditional mindset strategies, but do you feel they truly help you break free from anxiety? Why or why not?

🤔 Could embracing vulnerability, in addition to setting boundaries, be the real key to building emotional resilience? What are your thoughts on this approach?

Today, we're questioning the usual 'just think positive' advice for mental health. Ever felt that mindset tips seem all fluff? You're not alone!

In this episode, we'll cover the following topics with you:

✅ The dangers of relying solely on positive affirmations for mental resilience
✅ Why emotional intelligence is the missing piece in traditional coaching models
✅ How vulnerability can be a platform for personal and professional growth
✅ The balance between setting boundaries and maintaining meaningful connections
✅ How unprocessed emotions contribute to anxiety—and how to work through them

To any clinician that handle hand and elbow cases. Have a pt who works in an IT position  and was involved in motorcycle accident and is returning to work and wants a good one hand type keyboard to keep him productive. His left hand and elbow in a splint and NWB per MD. What do you recommend for this type pt. Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Speech to text...

There are a number of one handed key boards available (thankfully with Addison you can get a couple and return l, but it will depend on PT preference.

> **Response 2:** The patient sounds very motivated! If he can continue typing on a standard keyboard, that’s the easiest option. A one hand keyboard has a learning curve by the time he figures that out they may be out of the splint. Can he pronate? I’d call the surgeon and ask if typing is allowed, most say typing and writing is ok post op as long as he’s NWB through the arm and hand. Lots of arm supports while sitting at the desk and frequent breaks for the non injured hand if they type all day

Has anyone figured out a good way to handle patients who want to start care but their insurance isn't fully verified yet? We either delay treatment or risk eating the cost.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s a non-negotiable. I just let them know I need to verify coverage and they are usually okay with that. That’s how it works with all practitioners so it shouldn’t be any different with us.

> **Response 2:** I use spry pt so it is literally just one click of a button when they are registered and everything is verified so takes no real additional time at all.

We're taking that next step to fulfill that promise.

This is a part-time to full-time role, starting at 15 hours a week with the capacity to transition to full-time in as little as 6-8 weeks. I'm looking for someone with 1-2 years of experience who has strong clinical skills and judgment, but more importantly aligns with our values of continued learning & development, delivering exceptional customer service and care, and wanting to be a part of a growing company and helping to shape that vision.

Looking for someone who can help manage a website as well as newsletters, blogs, things like that. Bonus to manage IG page as well. For example, I send you a video, you edit and put it on IG with tags and all those things.
Guess that would be a VA. Does anyone use anything like Fiverr for that? Or have recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do this for several providers. I'm happy to chat or answer any q's even if we don't work together. You can def do Fiverr, but there's no guarantees. If you do, def use scheduling software so they don't have full access to your socials. Website you can give someone access without making them an admin so they can just post.

If anyone has any experience/knowledge about this, I would love to ask some questions please. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

Brandon Rosi had excellent thoughts as well

We use Charles Schwab. I bank with them and love the fact that there are no fees to use it or set anyone up.

👉 Ready to gain traction in your business that has been stalling

... Then the *UNCAGED Business Launchpad III* is for you!

✅ DAILY access to us via messaging to answer your questions

✅ A few other goodies that help you with your SYSTEMS 

**What is the VALUE of doing Launchpad,** e*ven if you have already started but are struggling a bit?*

These are things that we will help you to strengthen.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ASH was one of the worst insurances when I worked in an insurance practice-huge pain, I’m in ca though. They would authorize 1-3 visits at a time and make you do tons of extra paperwork

> **Response 2:** From my experience. Don’t do it. I’m in the process of canceling my contract with them

Thanks in advance!

Can anyone give input about legality of  offering weight-loss programs, as a PT?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If there’s concerns about adding a nutritional component, it largely depends on state practice act. Though many states that have practice exclusively around nutritional services/dietetics actually have exemptions for weight control services. However, some of those states require that a registered dietitian initially create the program.

> **Response 2:** My guess is that it would be a lot less sticky if you had a nutritional degree as well.  
Unless, your whole program was centered around exercise.  
Still, I honestly don’t know the answer.
Great question.

How do you know when it's time to end your business? I've loved being uncaged in my mobile specialized practice I've had for a year and while I'm not super busy, I'm not sure P.T. is my passion, or has ever been. I'm considering pivoting into something non healthcare related that when I think about, makes me excited, but not sure that I've given my mobile practice enough time to succeed? Any pearls of wisdom or advice? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** i think u answered your own question.

> **Response 2:** Will having your business succeed help the way you feel about it? Or make you more excited to do it day to day? I think that if the answer to that is no, pivoting sooner than later will be your best option in the long run!

Can someone tell me about audio and visual equipment for making professional quality movement videos? The more I search, the more confused it gets! Max budget $600-800ish. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Cait. I might be able to help. When you say professional quality, do you just mean image quality?

> **Response 2:** Can't help you- but I cannot imagine your smart phone not being good enough. When I'm looking at video, I rarely say there's an issue with the quality of the video. Audio? Get a lapel mic imo 

Put your money into good editing if anything.

in summary, take imperfect action. You can always redo videos in the future, just get it out there ASAP

Let’s be real…

Have you ever walked into a room — maybe a networking event, clinic, or even a Zoom call — and instantly thought:
😬 *“I don’t belong here.”*

That moment of doubt? That’s what we call **The Confidence Gap.**

And today’s episode is ALL about how to close it.

🔥 **David Bayliff** and **Hannah DeGroot** are breaking down what happens when you feel underqualified, stuck in imposter syndrome, or like everyone else “has it more together.”

Here’s what you’ll walk away with 👇
💭 Why feeling uncomfortable means you’re actually growing
💪 How to “borrow belief” when your confidence is low
🧠 Why comparison can either *drain you* or *drive you* — and how to choose the latter
🚪 Simple mindset shifts to help you step into the rooms that scare you most

This episode will hit home for SO many of you who are starting or growing your practice.

🎧 **Listen today — don’t wait.**

Confidence doesn’t come *before* you take action — it comes *because* you took action.

👉 **Listen on Spotify or Apple Podcasts (search “UNCAGED CLINICIAN” or click on the links in the comments)**

Then drop a 🔥 below once you’ve listened — and tell us your biggest takeaway!

**Original Post:**
Entrepreneurship is often filled with uncertainties, risks, and countless decisions. While external advice and research are valuable, one of the most important factors for success is the ability to trust yourself.

When you trust yourself, you will notice improvements in each of the following areas:

- Confidence in Decision-Making

- Resilience in the Face of Challenges

- Authenticity and Innovation

- Better Leadership

- Freedom from Over-Reliance on External Validation

- Enhanced Creativity and Problem-Solving

Why People May Struggle To Trust Themselves

There are many reasons that people find it difficult to trust themselves.

First, many people may have past experiences of not being heard, believed or even being taught to question their own experience.

Clinical question - 92 y/o patient fell and developed hematoma in the brachialis region of right forearm. Doesn’t have full supination PROM or AROM and painful. She fell a week ago. 

When/do I suggest imaging to role out fracture? She’s had imaging and they didn’t see anything. She has full AROM elbow flexion and extension. 

TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** X Ray can miss up to 30% of nondosplacrd radial head fractures. You may also have concerns for bicep rupture (do hook test) or supinator tear. Diagnostic ultrasound would be the quickest way to identify muscle pathology.

> **Response 2:** If she’s had imaging it is likely fine. I’d wait until roughly 2 week post fall at this point to see if ROM improves. 

If passive pronation/supination improves with the elbow flexed to 90, it’s likely soft tissue. If elbow position has no effect then that adds to the concern.

Pain with axial loading? Also if she has likelihood of gaining functional range, the conversation of ‘is surgery worth it’ comes into play. Because quality of life may be preserved more effectively without.

🔥 **NEW BLOG ALERT!** 🔥

**Leadership Begins with** **Confidence**

Let’s be real — leadership isn’t about how much you *know.*
It’s about the strength between your ears.

At UNCAGED CLINICIAN, we believe the best leaders aren’t the ones with the most experience or the biggest titles…

They’re the ones who have built *confidence* — the kind that fuels mental toughness, clear communication, and the courage to hold others accountable.

💭 Think about it:

We can’t truly lead others if we don’t trust ourselves first.

In our latest blog, we dive into:
👉 Why confidence is the key ingredient in every great leader
👉 How to strengthen mental toughness (without becoming “hard”)
👉 What it looks like to lead with humility, courage, and clarity — even on the “off days”

This one will challenge how you view leadership, and maybe even how you view yourself.

Check it out ➡️ [link in the comments]

🎧 And don’t miss this week’s UNCAGED CLINICIAN Podcast where David sits down with leadership coach Matt Phillips to explore how confidence shapes the way we lead, serve, and grow.

Confidence might just be the one thing standing between you and your next level.

Hey y'all! I had a worker's comp ask me to do work hardening for a paramedic I'm working with. In all honesty I usually just have my injured workers ready for return to work when I D/C so this is a first (and there's no one for over 50 miles from where this patient lives so that's why they want me to do it). Does anyone have experience on this? Do I bill 1 of 97545 every session for the first 2 hours and then 1 of 97546 for hour 3 if I keep her that long? They approved 12 work hardening visits which seems excessive to me but this is all new to me! Thank you for the help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, that is what you bill. You got it!

> **Response 2:** So we have a few work conditioning patients at our clinic, but I’m no expert on it but I do believe there is a difference in work hardening and work conditioning. What you are describing seems like work conditioning, not work hardening. I would just want to get all that clarified on the paperwork side so that payment doesn’t get denied. 

We typically have them come 3 times per week for 3 hours.

Has anyone had any luck with hiring a recruiter to help with hiring PTs?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Its not a lack of PTs, the issue is Pay. Productivity. Burn out. Invest more money into fixing those issues and you wont need a recruiter.

> **Response 2:** I spoke to a couple but they charge a lot. The ROI didn’t make sense for me.

Anyone here offer nutrition coaching in MA? What certifications do you like? Best bang for your buck? Do you need one to legally give nutrition advice as a PT? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m married to a registered dietitian and work with him for our side coaching business. I hear a lot of other PTs try to give nutrition advice, and it often times ends up being a disservice to the patients / clients. The best thing you can do for your clients if refer them to an RD. PTs providing nutrition coaching is like a personal trainer with their corrective exercise specialist cert doing our job. 

To answer your question though, nutrition coaching guidelines vary by state. MA does require anyone providing meal planning to be a registered dietitian, as well as nutrition guidance for anyone with a disease state (obesity technically included).

> **Response 2:** I have my health coach cert from HCI. I coach clients on healthy habits and provide guidance on fitness, food and supplementation but I don’t market to those clients as a “PT”…. If that makes sense?

Hello everyone!

Question here for my fellow PTA’s how are you leveraging your skills in the business world?

I’m trying to start a personal training side hustle as well as a soft tissue/PROM stretching, (not massage therapy) going to people’s home. 

So, I am wondering if there is anyone in here doing something similar? Wondering what your experience has been any advice you can offer? any suggestions regarding business in general. I am just trying to use my skills to start something of my own but I am feeling pretty lost 🤷🏻‍♂️🥲

**Community Responses:**

Have a brand new practice starting to work for. I’m only PT as of now. Another practice on area is closing. It was a chiro and PT. They want to start sending their patients to is as soon as get some things  in order. They were also OON not also accepted. Comp and MVA. Was wondering how many uncared clinicians accepted MVA and comp. I personally could do with out as then dealing with attorneys as well as some patients just don’t want to get better cause in lawsuits. Looking for opinions and how these payout as well.

Hi! I was wondering if any OP PT office has a massage therapist working with them, where the massage therapist would bill insurance. Considering hiring one as a 1099 and wondering what anyone’s experince is with how to go about it and what the reimbursement is like. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Most insurance companies will not credential LMTs so reimbursement is not possible. As an LMT, I've tried many times for my lymphedema work. Best option is clients can either seek reimbursement after paying cash or they can use an HSA/FSA card.

> **Response 2:** The massage that rents from me gets paid cash no insurance

Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In NYC max billing RVUs ends up at $114.60 per visit. I think it can be good depending on what type of practice you have. The one positive thing is the pts don’t have to pay so they typically stay compliant.

> **Response 2:** I do in upstate NY. It's one of our better payers, and it's been worth it for us

Functional testing before liposuction..does anyone know what this entails?  A physician asked me if I can perform PT functional testing for patients with lipedema prior to any liposuction which is req’d from their insurance.  I will clarify if she needs functional testing (TUG, sit to stand etc…) or more of a FCE but wanted to check here first

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I JUST had my first patient call and ask me for this a few weeks ago!  It's called the Lipedema Physical Evaluation through an organization called Cover Lipedema.  The patient will have all the forms you'll need to fill out.  Takes about an hour.

Apologies if this has been addressed before, but I was unsuccessful finding information in the search bar. I have a PT applicant who is here on a work visa and is sponsored to work via SNF. Is this person allowed to work for me as well? I don't know the nuances of work visas and would much appreciate any help. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No. work visas are for single employer only. Unless that person’s employer will contract with you and he/she is still
under that employer’s payroll.

> **Response 2:** One can only work for the employer who filed for the work visa. That person can work for you only if you want to file for his concurrent H1B visa for your part time work….hope this makes sense… if you need more details please reach out.. I was on work visa before so I know a little bit about it…

Looking for advice on how to transition patients from your current place to private practice with least amount of hassle and staying professional about it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think that those patients belong to the practice.  Not to you.  So, it’s not ethical.  If the patient wants you, the should call the old practice and ask where you went

Sorry for another software question - I am a cash only PT practice that also offers remote fitness programming. I have been using TrainHeroic for my fitness programming, but I'm looking to increase the volume of programming clients I have and I want to make sure I am using the software that is most efficient for me and the best  client experience for my customers, does anyone have any experience with CoachRX and/or TrainHeroic and have a strong preference?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use coachRX. I like it overall. Generally much quicker than TrainHeroic for me. But it doesn’t track things even closely to as much as train heroic does. Volume, estimated 1RMs, etc aren’t tracked in coachRX unless you do it yourself.

> **Response 2:** I’m a TrueCoach enjoyer

Anyone have input on steps to helping me get an in-person pelvic floor birth prep session/event up and running? No one in my area does anything like it, and there is a big want and need, but having trouble where to start. Anyone use Wix events for RSVP? Do I need a waiver or consent? Taking payment? Any suggestions about the whole ordeal would be helpful!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have done a bunch...I use calendly which can also take payment. We had people sign a waiver and then that also populated them into receiving our newsletter. Ours have been an hour. I'd be happy to answer questions.

> **Response 2:** I have done in-person before. I would stick to an hour. Maybe do multiple sessions. 
I always used eventbrite but you can go with Google forms as well. 
If it’s purely educational, no consent for needed. Just a clause when they are agreeing g to the sign up. 
Payment can be done however you want. You can do CC processing, or Venmo or you can make it free

After searching posts, I see a lot of negative experiences around personal injury/LOP. Anybody have positive experiences with it all? Is there good money to be made?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you don’t mind waiting up to 2 years to get paid (happened to me once) and dealing with everything that comes along with law suits, it can be a source of extra income. 

I charge a $500 up front fee to make sure I’m getting paid some up front, and 90% of offices will say they will contact another PT clinic. This has been a great way for me to weed out the attorney offices I don’t want to work with anyways and also to get paid a portion up front to re-invest in the business.

> **Response 2:** I have had an attorney contact me to see those patients when it is all set up . I need to look into it too as don’t know what the pro and cons are . @ Kylewinters if you can share the info of the above person as there are so many with same name that would help thanks

Question for my Pediatric experts out there.
What is the efficacy or are outcomes good with pre-operative PT tongue/lip tie in infants? Or is the frenectomy the usual outcome anyway? Friend of mine was asking about his new child.

I also recommend ST and OT as well but just looking for info for him.  Thanks in advance! Didn't get a great response in other groups I posted so figured I'd cross post here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely want to work with a good IBCLC plus a therapist who is trained in infant oral motor skills and Myofascial release pre and post frenectomy. Some babies will improve significantly with therapy and not require a release while others will ultimately need one but will have much better outcomes if they have done work beforehand

> **Response 2:** PT is great for pre and post release when done with a therapist who has taken the appropriate coursework, but therapy won’t take away the need for a frenectomy if the child needs it. PT can help with decreasing tension, improving ROM, and helping with motor skills for little ones with TOTs 😊.

I am looking to reach out to local schools about doing a contract to provide my mobile OT pediatric services (I am in CA). Any knowledge or suggestions on how I could go about this? I searched the group for previous posts about it but didn’t find anything directly related to this. I guess I am just not sure who the right person to contact is within the schools? Any information is helpful, thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, what Lori said. Get the SPED Directors info from the district website and reach out to them. You can get a good idea of what schools might need help by looking at their careers page and seeing which ones have OT openings, but don't limit yourself to just those.

> **Response 2:** Look up district special education directors. Tell them you're interested in providing school therapy services and see when their current contracts expire. Our districts just renewed, so you may have to wait until next year,  but get your name out and maybe one will know of schools needing help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Yes!  I like mine though, don't like the big holes it leaves behind so I usually shake the roots off and fill it back with dirt if I use it in the grass.  My 4yr loves to help me use it too!

Hi all! Looking to see if I can file an LLC in PA on my own...couple things I'm unsure of. Is PT considered a "restricted professional service "? And also would PT be considered a "benefit company"? since we are technically improving human health. Thanks in advance if anyone ran into these same questions. Is it better just to pay someone to do all this?

Does anyone have an estimate on how long hi-lo treatment tables last? Any experience with rebuilding or getting replacement parts? I'm just starting my clinic and am looking at a used table, about 8-10 years old. I'm concerned about how long the hydraulics and/or motor will last. Thanks!

Depending on where you are and if you want to bill insurance will determine what your clinic structure needs to look like. We bill Medicaid and are required to have a medical director in FL.

Are you......

chasing productivity quotas?
drowning in documentation?
feeling burned out and boxed in?

If these hit home, this week’s blog is for you.

**Remember what it was like when you started grad school?**

There was excitement.  Passion. Dreams existed.

If you were like me, you felt like a young kid again. 

Nervous as heck walking into class that first day knowing absolutely NO ONE.

But I knew that my journey was starting right then and there; on that day.

As we move along in our journeys, The System sucks all of that positive-ness and hope right out of us.

We conform to the expected norm.  Burnout prevails. 

The Establishment doesn't care.  Thousands of new clinicians are knocking on the door each year.

The best in you has served its purpose.

**George Bernard Shaw** said it best:

*"We don't quit playing because we grow old. We grow old because we quit playing."*

In 2020, 22K - as in 22,000 - of us quit playing.  Many because of burnout.

You ***can*** bring the playground back into your own life, and have fun doing it.

**Are you ready to feel like a kid again and build not only a business, but also a life that is *UNCAGED*?**

We are releasing the next **UNCAGED Business Launchpad** this **Wednesday, Oct 11**

Come play with us.

And build those dreams you once had.  And feel like a kid again.

Comment **"Dreams"** below to get all of the details.

- - - 

This is a HUGE passion project for me. Work and Leadership through the lens of faith. 

I'm hosting a 6 week intensive focused on developing as leaders. 
Starting June 1 at 8:00 am EST, 6 weeks work and leadership intensive through the lens of faith (If we have enough request for an evening time I'll host 2x/week. All sessions will be recorded for watching after as well)

Week 1. Calling, Equipping, Your Why? 
 - We’re often told to think about our “why?” What does this mean and where is your why coming from? 

Week 2. What gets in the way? Our Stories
 -Each of us has a history of wins, lessons, trials, tribulations, successes and seeming failures. Each of these has a voice that comes with them that competes for our attention. Which voice is loudest to you and what does that mean towards you progressing towards your goals?

Week 3. Enneagram 
 -We often focus on our strengths and weaknesses but how do you view yourself in terms of your motivation and how do you communicate that to yourself and others? 

Week 4. Boundaries
 - We’ve all been told that having boundaries is important but how do you understand the tension between boundaries and the calling to love, serve, care and lead? 

Week 5. Creating Resilience 
 - what is the process we need to go to become more resilient people and leaders? 

Week 6. Stand and Lead
 - What do you stand for? What do you aspire to be as a leader?

We’ll be reading 2 different books included in the price of the 6 week intensive. Strong and Weak by Andy Crouch and Tempered Resilience by Tod Bolsinger. The cost of an Enneagram assessment is also included in the cost of the program so please sign up early so you can get access to the readings in advance! 

NOTE: We'll be discussing faith through a Christian focus but all are welcome, I just want to be transparent about the direction I'm coming from. 

Follow the link in the comments to sign up!

Hello all,
I am new to owning my own OT practice and I was wondering if I could have someone explain to me the crazy world of insurance. I have had a few patients already but all have paid cash because I do not take insurance besides straight Medicare and workers compensation. 

I basically need someone to explain to me the differences in insurances and what insurances are worth taking or not. I have had a few clients reach out to me and be disappointed when I don’t take their insurance. I know a lot of managed medicares do not have high reimbursement rates, that’s why I have been so hesitant to take them. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What state do you practice in?

I’d be happy to help where I can. Just send me a DM if you’d like.

> **Response 2:** Hi! Where are you in Ohio?! I’m always looking for OT to refer to; we only offer PT and wellness (mobile)

Currently a hospital based part time PT and wanting to start cash-based mobile PT on the side. Wondering about the implications with my hospital employer. Anyone have some experience with this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What type of rehab in the hospital? Outpatient? Or inpatient? 

I was outpatient OT part time when I was planning my cash-based mobile OT practice. Since it would have been a direct competition and conflict of interest between my practice and the hospital clinic, I did not accept any private patients or did any marketing prior to leaving the hospital outpatient clinic. Instead, I used that time to get my business fully set up (insurance, EMR, etc) to be fully operational when I resigned from the hospital. 

I’m not sure if that was the best move, but I was gun-shy in negative repercussions from a big hospital system that can potentially sue/fine for moonlighting

> **Response 2:** Yes I was in the same boat when starting my practice. Feel free to DM me

Hi all- I’ve stepped away from typical patient care since becoming a mom and have only been seeing a handful of patients here and there. I had someone reach out because she’s getting her ACL repaired and is really hoping I treat her. It’s been a good 5 years since I treated an ACL and I’m feeling insecure about it. Does anyone have any good online courses (that won’t break the bank) that will help to refresh/update my knowledge? Appreciate any insights!

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I know a local acupuncturist who was looking into this but there seemed to be a lot of red tape that was holding her up. So it seems like it was a pretty tedious process. But I’m following because if someone else has figured it out then I want to do it too lol.

> **Response 2:** There is an attorney who is also a PT that I contacted. She said its possible, but not usually worth it.

5 ways to calm the brain when stress is getting to us.

Have you ever had days - or periods of time - where you had so much extraneous stuff going on that your brain felt like a jar of marbles that had spilled, and marbles were bouncing everywhere?

We are  sure you know the feeling.  We all have experienced this.  Some of us more than others.

Things such as disappointments with business/work, the kids are sick, struggles with the spouse or significant other, and a host of other topics can certainly create massive distractions.

Chaos in the head can make it a challenge to focus on the necessary task at hand.

When left unchecked, this can put us in a funk for days making it difficult to regain our focus for being productive.

When/if you find yourself in this predicament, here are five techniques that we suggest for bringing order to the bouncing marble balls.

They do not have to be carried out in this order, but we do suggest that you engage in all five for full effectiveness.

1:Pick one thing to act on.  The success from tackling one thing will help to build back your momentum for getting other boxes checked.

2:Reflect on what has been working for you, or the things that you do well.

3:You can turn the wreckage around through praise.  Praise can be done through listening to uplifting music, or by reading books that contain a positive message. Choose whatever is encouraging for you.  It may be songs that get you pumped up, songs that soothe you, or media that has spiritual content.

4:Journaling is a phenomenal tool for bringing calm to a maelstrom.

Not everyone is a writer.  But there are times when sitting down with pen and paper in a peaceful place can do wonders.

5:Whenever you find yourself in distress or in unrest, we encourage you to Pray.  Regardless of your beliefs, pray.  Speak to the universe, to nature,  or to whomever is dominant in your Faith.  This does wonders for clearing the mind. Putting your thoughts out there will very often lead to you  answering  your own questions, or solving your own dilemmas.

Seeking advice on transitioning mobile outpatient therapists to clinical specialist roles. Wondering how smaller home-based practices afford this change given lower profit margins. Looking for realistic pay increase figures and averages for such positions. 

Our clinical specialists would oversee 4-8 therapists for clinical aspects, documentation, and onboarding, without involvement in finances, marketing,￼ HR,  or day-to-day operations. Based in the tri-state area (Philadelphia to Delaware). Mostly Medicare B and cash OON clients.  Need insights beyond the $95-115K range as all we found online was for a therapy manager, not a clinical specialist type of position.   Any and all input appreciated.

Thank you!!

Looking at trying to find space to rent, but also keep my overhead as low as possible! Have started looking into renting space from another facility (not within the same field) on their off hours or hours they are closed.  I have a few meetings set up - what are the major things I should be asking/checking for? One of the spaces has never rented out to anyone before, so I want to go in with an idea of what I should be looking for/discussing! 

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey Lauren! This doesn’t answer your question you posed, but hopefully leads to ideas on how to keep overhead low. If you’re in or close to a larger city, luxury apartment buildings / condos can have massage rooms as well as gyms. I was able to successfully pitch this to an apartment building for very favorable terms. You also provide value to the apartment building—the leasing agents will mention to their prospective tenants that there is a physical therapist on site (not to mention this is a pipeline of clients). This has a been a great opportunity to help get my business off the ground, hopefully something like this can apply to you!

> **Response 2:** Go into the meeting with the mindset of figuring out what THEY want out of the arrangement. That way you can pitch terms that benefit you both. Don’t expect to leave the first meeting with a deal, and tell them so. Just say you are meeting to get to know them better and see if your businesses could benefit each other.

Hello everyone! I was curious if anyone here has ever designed a warm up/strengthening program for a team and charged for it? If so, how much? I have had a cheer group reach out after I treated one of their girls. I feel like my hourly rate for the time I put in would be way too much. My personality will make sure it is just right and that may take a few hours for sure. Any suggestions would be appreciated. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did something similar with a junior golf camp over the summer. 

I led the whole group in a warmup routine, and then did 10 minute injury screenings for all the campers for free. Then, I emailed the parents all the info, any concerns and recommendations I had. 

Establishing connections with the parents will be the best move long term.

Hello!
I am an OT working towards starting my own practice in homes with newborns and babies. 

I have an opportunity to possibly rent a space at a chiropractors office who specializes in pre/post natal and babies. 

Does anyone have a similar relationship? Pros/cons? 

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would absolutely do it if the price is reasonable. The automatic referrals would be huge. I wouldn’t want to pay a percentage of my profits though, which I think is common in this kind of situation. But if they are just asking for a flat monthly rent that is reasonable, I would go for it!

> **Response 2:** We almost did it and decided against it. We almost said yes because we didn't have that much business yet, but we just waited a month and before you know we were getting busier and busier.  So in the end it was a better choice for us not to go with them

Let’s talk workshops. 

I have never done a true workshop, but I I’d like to get my feet wet in this arena. My practice is myself and a colleague and we primarily do in office visits now with some mobile. Focus is on pelvic health, especially in the pregnant and postpartum population.￼ for those of you in this field, what kind of workshops are you putting on? I’d like to do a higher quality one in charge admission but not sure the best topic that will get people in the door. Marketing is not necessarily my strong suit. Any suggestions are welcomed. Thank you!￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There is so much need for this! I just did one recently for moms who crossfit. Lots of education about common problems, what PT is like for this, and how successful PT can be. I went back and forth between me educating and the moms getting to talk and share their birth stories and experiences getting back into exercise. People loved getting to share. Also we provided bagels and mimosas to make it a little more fun 😊

Wondering what everyone's policy is on masks right now for mobile visits.
1. requiring staff to wear in the home? If they are IC's can we legally require them to anyway?
1. Policy for known exposure to covid....if asymptomatic, can they see patients with a mask?
1. Policy if they have covid. Out for 5 days and then can return if asymptomatic without a test?

Developing my current and ever changing covid protocols and wondering what everyone is doing. I am in FL which of course makes things different than NY.

Hi everyone. 

I have a daughter inquiring about private pay PT on weekends for her father in Grand Blanc. Currently, he is s/p CVA (~Sept 2025) and is dependent for most things. He is wrapping up his SAR stay prob over the next week or so (the building is okay with external PT to come in on weekends). Then will probably turn into additional care into the week days (alongside/following HHC). 

If anyone is interested or knows a therapist in that area that is comfortable working with her father please DM or Text me, so I can connect you with them. 248 266-5721

I've been dreaming about hosting a musician's wellness retreat for a couple years, this is the year I want to launch... Problem is $ and what musicians find valuable. So many times we live in broke mindset, but what if spending $$ could change your life and what you command in performance, self confidence and my realm: prevent and overcome injury for yourself (and maybe your whole band/crew?) 

I struggle with it myself, until I paid $4k for a 6 night stay in the Waldorf Astoria Washington DC and $12k for a new flute (finally!) and it was WORTH EVERY PENNY!

But musicians are broke, right?

No.

You always find the money for the things you want, whether it's a new instrument or a good night's sleep .

I have a LOT of ideas but before I go into it, what would make you say YES!!! Immediately yes!  To a wellness retreat (especially if it was catered specifically to musicians?)

Feel free to DM if you would prefer.

🤔 Have you ever felt like an imposter in your own business, despite knowing you're capable?

🤔 What if the only thing standing between you and success is your belief in yourself?

Today, we’re tackling a common challenge for entrepreneurs—self-doubt. We all hear that nagging voice asking, “What if I fail?” or “Am I good enough?” I've faced these doubts myself, and in this episode, I'll share strategies for overcoming them and taking charge of your success. This discussion is crucial, whether you're starting out or well into your entrepreneurial journey.

In this episode, we'll cover the following topics with you:

✅ The illusion of confidence and why even successful people struggle with self-doubt
✅ How self-fulfilling prophecies can sabotage your business
✅ The hidden cost of fearing failure more than embracing success
✅ Why some people would rather fail and be "right" than take a risk and win
✅ The importance of surrounding yourself with people who see your potential

Who’s doing only health and wellness (NOT in addition to injury/condition-specific physical therapy)?  If PTs or OTs are doing this, did they also pursue additional certifications as Nutritionists?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Lifestyle Medicine is an evidence based approach and the certification encompasses many aspects of healthcare and wellness.

> **Response 2:** I do health wellness coaching separate from physical therapy. Nutrition/diet is state dependent, as w many other health/wellness things. Check your laws and that may determine if you need to pursue a cert or not.

Hi Uncaged Clinicians! 

We have a websites and business email question. We have had a wix account for a couple of years but never built the website. We just bought the domain and obtained a business email. We are now looking at finally building the website and wondering if Wix is the best fit. 

Initially, it would act basically as a digital business card, but we are hoping to expand to selling digital products, offering classes, etc. Is there a better host to use for this? 

What is recommended for using a business email? Wix has tripled our cost over 3 years for our business email. 

Finally, any individuals or companies you recommend to help build the website that is reasonably priced and would be willing to teach us how to modify content? 

Thank you all for any input you send this way!

**Community Responses:**

Any recs for someone great around Brandenburg?

DME question- 
I am a mobile PT and have recently been seeing more patients I’d consider homebound and dc from HH but still in need of skilled care. I’ve been making recommendations for DME and modifications without a thorough understanding of what may or may not be covered by Medicare /MAP and Medicaid (NJ), and how frequently that equipment may be replaced. 
Specifically, looking for coverage of orthotics/braces, AD, wheelchairs, power chairs, hoyer/sit to stand lifts, hospital beds/ pressure relief mattresses. I am aware that Medicare does not cover bathroom DME which blows my mind since a majority of falls in home occur there🤷‍♀️
I’d appreciate any info or resources where best to find this info without having to be on phone for hours with insurance companies. 
I also plan to reach out to local DME vendors to develop a relationship and with hopes they can facilitate the process more easily for my patients. 
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wheelchairs n mobility items usually every 5 years.  Splints n braces used to be yearly but I'm not sure now, my building pays out of pocket for splints n braces under Med A.  Med B I think gets covered

I was wondering if anybody here has started an aquatic therapy business for dogs?
I'm very curious if anyone has ever gone down this path and if it was all cash based, would this still fall under practicing physical therapy with my license and with my business partner's license?

My business partner is a PT and I am a PTA. I live in a region where I think aquatic therapy for dogs could be incredibly lucrative, and has opportunity for visits at our own pool, or travel visits to clients that have their pool at their own hones too.

Just curious if anyone here has done this as therapists, or if the business could be a standalone therapy business for dogs that has nothing to do with our PT and PTA licenses?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** TheK9PT - Canine Rehabilitation & Wellness might be a good resource for you to reach out to

> **Response 2:** Check your state laws. In Florida, canine PT can only be performed by licensed individuals - vets, vet techs, or PTs with specific training in canine a&p (not positive if actual CCRT is required but it may be).

Hi everyone! I have been talking to a gym owner about using one of their empty offices to set up my PT clinic and I want to make sure I am doing things correctly. I am in CA, for reference. My biz is currently mobile and cashed based, but might consider adding Medicare eventually. 
Now my question is, what do I have to make sure that is in place for me to cover all by bases? Is there specific zoning, or permits, or contracts that I have to ask from them? Also, I felt that they were a little hesitant about me using the gym’s address because they are a franchise but they are trying to work around it, could this also be an issue in the future?
Thanks in advance!

My existing business is mobile and cash based. I have 2 employees and a contractor. I started a corporate wellness program that one of my employees has lead. I want to split that off into a separate business that is co owned by her and I. I have invested significant time and cash into this startup. I’m totally on board with being co owners of this. I need help coming up with a business partnership agreement and understanding what business entity we should be to get this registered as. So far I have done everything myself with my existing business. I want to make sure this new arrangement is clearly documented and not really sure how to make fair with my money already invested and her willingness to buy in and or put in the sweat equity outside of her regular job within my business. Does anyone have experience or insight on this process?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I can’t answer your question other than to say that someone like Gwen Simmons (PT lawyer) would be an excellent resource. 

I’m wondering if you could help me out, though. I’m looking to start a corporate wellness program and would love to talk with someone who’s been successful in this endeavor!

Has anyone written a letter to get a patient out of jury duty? One of my chronic pain patients got called for jury duty and is not physically up to the task.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have written one for one of my patients. Show her our schedule etc. She got out. But of course, my patients are seniors/Medicare beneficiary. Now, I tried one for 2 of my employees and it got denied by the judge. Stating that PT is NOT an emergency situation/services. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** For my state it must be an MD or equivalent. It also depends on who is reading the reason of excuse. 

My MD couldn't get me out of it when I was full-term pregnant. Literally gave birth 2 days after the week long trial ended.

Looking for additional clinical mentors 
Reposting as non anonymous 

Hi! I’m an early clinician, graduated in 2022. Looking for some additional mentors who are willing to help me increase my skills. Looking for improvement in sports/ortho, acute injury rehab, etc. Ideally someone who is willing to talk with me about my cases every day or a couple times a week. Help me develop my clinical reasoning and challenge me, versus telling me what to do. If you’re interested, please comment and I will reach out. Thank you for your time!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love this post. I just wish I worked in your clinical area, I am in IPR/neuro. I commend you for reaching out for mentorship. There is not enough of it in this field. I always tell my students and any new grads to keep asking questions and ask for mentorship. I think schools give the impression if you go through their program you will know everything you need to know. New grads think questions show weakness. I’ve been doing PT for 23 years and I still ask questions. We are always learning. I had a patient last week that I tried 3 new treatment ideas with that I have never done in my career. I asked my patient if she was okay being a guinea pig. She said “Absolutely, if it is going to help me, and help you help other people like me.” ♥️♥️♥️

> **Response 2:** I can help you with the critical reasoning. I have a resource that will be helpful. Let’s touch base after Thanksgiving. We can set up a zoom and go over it!

Hi all,

Need some advice!

I am a cash PT that works out of a brick & mortar, ￼ with atheltes and one of them wants me to travel out of town (flying) to treat them. I am trying to figure out the best way to structure my fee. I was thinking of charging as a base what I would typically be seeing in the clinic those days & then potentially an additional travel fee? 

Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That so one question I have is are you licensed in the state they are traveling to? I believe that you need to be licensed in that state in order to treat them.

> **Response 2:** U. Need licensure in the state u will be treating.

**Aurora, CO
**Anyone have resources/recommendations for home mods, aging in place, or supplemental services in this area for a low-income senior citizen? 

**Looking for recommendations for: 
**
- Laundry services
- Meal delivery that can accommodate special diets
- Caregiving agencies 
- Home modification services (moving laundry to main level, ramping the front, bathroom remodel) 
- Driver rehab
- Other community resources I should look into?

This is for my aunt who recently fell and broke both wrists, both shoulders, and her jaw. (Doozy of a fall, right?) 

Her main goal is to remain in her home, like most people. :) 

I think she's "doing well" in rehab and discharging soon, but I'm not sure she can do all the IADL tasks she'll need to do. She JUST got clearance to use & weight-bear through her wrists. 

I'm an OT in WA state and currently a non-clinical marketing strategist for other context. So I'm not 100% in the loop with Medicare changes. 

>> Then when it's time for outpatient therapy, who takes Medicare and covers Aurora? (I promise, my aunt is someone you'd like working with. She oozes positive energy, lol.)

Hello all, 
Just wondering how you send medical records when requested by your patients?  If you print them for your patients, do you charge a fee and if so, what is the cost? Our attorney said fax is not more secure than email. 
We have always sent private or sensitive info via email through Microsoft for medical professionals so it’s hippa compliant but Microsoft changed our access and said we needed to purchase a primiere account however we can’t purchase the primiere account because we don’t have a big enough corporation. 
We are just looking for options. Any and all info welcome. 🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My sister (banker) turned me on to an app tfat they use called PDF reader Pro,  that you can send secure emails to anyone.   It’s supposed to be very easy, I just haven’t used it yet.

> **Response 2:** #Compliance Are you are Covered Entity under #HIPAA- if so suggest reviewing requirements and guidance (including fees).  Form/format of records can be requested by patient.  Do patients complete form to request records?

Question about unpaid interns. We have a bunch of undergrads looking for experience/work this summer. We aren’t in a position to hire so it would be unpaid. If anyone has done this before, how have you set up the experience so it benefits you/your business but is also a good experience for the student? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Every state has different regulations regarding unpaid internships/shadowing. They also have rules that may require HIPAA training, background check etc depending on your specific state regulations and your patient population. I am going to have a person shadow me this summer, so I have been googling a lot. I have not found any one resource so far.

> **Response 2:** Most schools do internships and they are almost always unpaid create a contract with the school and they will send u students

I recently started a mobile PT business focusing only on the senior population. I have been struggling getting patients and building relationships with referral sources. What would you recommend the best marketing strategy would be to increase my patient caseload and referrals?

Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Where do your people hang out? What are their common complaints?

Answer their questions and solve their simple problems for free in a workshop or some other avenue your specific people group will be likely to access. (Probably not TikTok videos, for example.)

Nurture relationships with the ones you have. Let them know you're new at business ownership -- actively invite their feedback and solicit their help spreading the word.

NPPES question:

My current employer (corporate company) requested access for my NPPES account when I started a few years ago, so that they could add me to their group with Medicare. I gave them access (I thought that was normal) but I recently went to login and found out that they changed my multi-factor authentication to a company email address that I don’t have access to. I have access to the primary email address and can update my password. But I can’t pass the multi-factor authentication to actually login to the account. This is an issue for me because I want to create an NPI for my LLC but can’t login to my account! Do I need to get my current employer involved in this or is there a way to change the multi-factor authentication without getting them directly involved? 

Side note- Can I use my personal NPI on a Superbill for the time being? (I am strictly out of network)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same happened to me. Trying to remember what I did, I think I had to call their customer service and request to change to my email

> **Response 2:** Update: I talked to customer service and they are going to create a new login for me. They asked me to verify my account with 5 security questions, all which I failed to answer correctly. Meaning my current employer changed the multifactor authentication and changed my security questions/set up security questions without me knowing.

Hi everyone! I’m looking for a recommendation for a design engineer if anyone has one! I’ve been diagnosed with hEDS and our practice is an OON sports based clinic, so it’s safe to say my fingers and knees are starting to bother me. I’m looking to make more everyday, sleek and subtle versions of some finger and knee braces for myself to prevent hypertension. Also that wouldn’t be uncomfortable for my patients dying manual work with my hands and knee braces that would allow me to squat up and down and get on and off the floor without impacting my ability to do so!  I’ve spoken to my doctors and quite a few reps from DME companies and I’ve been advised to create my own designs as what I’m looking for doesn’t exist! If anyone has any product recommendations as well I’d be open to trying anything at this point. I’ve worked extensively on finger extrinsics and positioning during manual and hypertrophied the heck out of my quads so I feel it’s time to look for external stability!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't have any knee brace advice, other than you can buy some really expensive off the shelf nice ones on ebay. If you want cheap parts to build one or to alter. I personally have a thuasne custom rebel pro and like it, it doesn't slide

Hi everyone! Hoping to get some advice on a billing system. I was looking through the group but couldn't really find an answer for my specific case. My business is solely for EI and pediatric services and I just became an official vendor for the Regional Center in my area (Roseville, CA) and also see private clients. I don't take insurance but I think I need to set up some type of documentation/billing system to keep more organized. I have done a demo with HelloNote and JaneApp. Anyone have any advice with which one would be best for my situation? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We used Healthie for quite awhile. I liked it for the cash side of services. We also take insurance and it became too much for that. If you're going to build programs, its great. However, Practice Better is even better IMO. If you aren't going to build programs out, IntakeQ may be an even more cost effective fit.

Anyone in the Southbury, CT area or near there that can help a patient get back to deadlifting and takes Aetna? My friend is a 49 yr old female and post-discectomy. Their current PT told them that they will never will able to deadlift again and I disagree. I’ve treated far too many people like them at this point for that to be true. Who is up for helping this person get back to living life how they want?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ugh wish I was there. I agree with you! So damaging the kinds of words we use with patients, have to remain diligent in being mindful of its effects!

> **Response 2:** Not there, but I agree! I hate generalized/blanket statements like that. With proper body mechanics and being mindful of not over lifting one can absolutely work towards deadlifting post discectomy. 🙄. Can’t guarantee everyone will be safe doing it but that’s not a reason to not safely work towards it and test it out safely.

Hi there! 

I hope this is okay to ask here :) I have a friend who is a talented ortho therapist looking for part-time telehealth opportunities in PT. She would love to eventually travel as a PT, so I am sure she'd be open to getting licensed in another state (she's located in IL). Is anyone potentially looking for someone for a role like this? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Telehealth Physical Therapy Providers (PT - Physio) , maybe she can find something here

> **Response 2:** Power wheelchair evaluation?

Question for mobile practices! -- Since our EMR is cloud based and my staff need access to wireless internet while doing POS documentation, I provide my staff with mobile hotspots. However, I am looking for a new provider or solution to this. Does anyone have a similar setup and/or can you recommend a different way to problem solve this? THANK YOU x ONE MILLION! (cross posted).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I get the Wi-Fi password in everyone’s house , use an iPad and it limits the amount of use of my phone’s hotspot

> **Response 2:** MiFi devices are portable routers that can provide wireless internet access. They are often more compact than traditional mobile hotspots and can connect multiple devices. Research MiFi options from different providers to see if this could be a more convenient solution for your team.

Hello all! I saw a patient a few months ago for some pain that she felt may have been related to an automotive accident. I saw her for and eval and 2 treatment sessions. I recently received a request from a law group to send them her medical record and an itemized billing statement for her treatment related to this accident. I was curious if anyone has any experience with something like this and advice on next steps. Ironically when looking back at the evaluation notes the subjective report states that she said she was unsure if the pain is related to the accident and it started a few months later. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Be sure they sent a medical records release signed by your patient. Send only what they ask for, no more, no less. Charge for your time and any postage for the task. If they use your notes in the case, expect to get one from the other attorneys  as well.

> **Response 2:** I’ve had this too. Send what you have… if it doesn’t support their case they’ll just toss it anyway

Thank you for bringing me along on your healing journey. 

Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome. Emphasis on pelvic floor, but I do have a few general wellness clients.

I was wondering If there is anyone I could talk to or anyone that could offer insight?
Im in the middle of start my own cash based mobile practice and I know that in order to be successful you need to find a niche, cause If you try to offer your services to everyone you'll get no one. 
So right now i'm a little stuck on finding my niche. Right now im stuck between MMA/combat athletes and powerlifters/strength athletes. I've been an active member in both niches (practiced bjj and mma for several years and also powerlifted) but ofc im not an expert In either area but have an interest to serve a niche from a physical therapy standpoint. I guess Im trying to gauge on which niche has the potential to be success In the longrun. Can anyone offer some advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I feel like your niche gets more clear as you start to see more patients. Start with what you like and you can always sharpen the niche as you go

> **Response 2:** Sean Vo!  You just inspired a LIVE!  I'll answer this in a LIVE in just a second!

As someone who hardly ever travels on a plane. How do you get things like lithium batteries for say a cell phone backup charger or a heated vest that uses a battery onto the plane?

Is it even possible?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can just keep it all in your carry-on. I take the battery out of my vest and keep it in my bag and I've never had an issue. I've traveled with normatec boots, massage guns, heated vests....and tsa never bats an eye. Just make sure the batteries are in your carry-on and not checked!

> **Response 2:** I’ve never had a problem with getting one in my carry-on. They run it through the scanners like you’d expect. The TSA folks see hundreds of them every day. No big deal. The vest MIGHT be a little trickier (although who knows) since having a vest with electronics in it might make some people nervous on the C-rays

Ask: can anyone recommend a fantastic, hands on therapist in the Wilkes Barre, PA area?

Women's health would be a plus. 

Otherwise anyone experienced treating back and neck pain related to pregnancy, nursing, etc. She is the full time caregiver to baby and needs major TLC and desensitization to tolerate life.  

Looking for one-on-one care.

Has anyone dealt with bots filling out their website submission forms? Lately we’ve been getting bots on a daily basis and it’s very frustrating. A lot of time it has actual information (people’s name, phone number, etc), but when we reach out to them they act like we are crazy because they never contacted us.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We’ve run into this too and it’s super frustrating. 

A couple of things usually make a difference. First, the CRM you’re using can play a big role since some are much better at filtering spam than others. Hosting matters too—certain platforms are just more vulnerable. And of course, captcha is a big one. If you don’t have reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha turned on, that’s worth trying because it usually cuts down the noise in a big way.

Sometimes it’s also about looking under the hood. If the submissions are all coming from the same IP range, you can block them right at the host level. And if they still sneak through, you can add filtering rules inside your CRM so the junk never even hits your inbox.

Curious—what platform are you on right now, and do you have captcha enabled? That’ll help point to the best fix.

**Original Post:**
Any foot/ankle specialists out there?

I have a patient with metatarsalgia. However, upon examination he had a neuroma removed between his 3rd and 4th digit one year ago, and he has significant scar tissue there which feels like is pushing his 4th metatarsal head inferiorly and his bone is protruding inferiorly.  Scar tissue mobs, strengthening and shockwave is helping. 

However, the patient naturally doesn’t heel strike.  He doesn’t even land mid strike.  He lands on his metatarsal heads.  With education he is working in this… but I’m wondering if a zero drop shoe would help facilitate a heel strike better? 

Any thoughts are appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Agree that low drop shoe might not be the first choice if you’re looking to promote easy heel strike. If it’s irritable it might be worth considering a slightly more cushioned shoe that isn’t zero drop. But I think considering a wide toe box would still be beneficial!

Also, possibly not relevant but I’ve noticed it on myself, may be worth looking up the chain and seeing if he is carrying his weight in his forefeet because of proximal posture.

> **Response 2:** Hey there, what type of shoe is he currently in? Is this with running or walking? Same pattern both feet? I think you’re right on with considering his strike pattern as an aggravating factor. Obviously there can be exceptions, but generally a lower drop/zero drop shoe tends to encourage less rearfoot strike, not more. I’d also be curious to see how this patient would do in a more rockered shoe (not necessarily long term, but in the short term) - sometimes this can take stress off the metatarsals since it’s generally going to reduce the bending forces here and the amount of loaded MTP extension needed. (Feel free to send me a message if you want to chat further in depth!)

ATTN BAY AREA PT's
I am currently in the beginning stages of my cash-pay/entrepreneurial journey. I am currently working 4 days a week at an OP facility on a 3 month contract, however its basically a mill. I like this because I feel like I can keep applying what I learn on the volume of patients I see within this contract. I am hesitant to leave this job/setting because my only consistent patient load will come from my home health contracts and I don't want to lose skill. 
OFFER: I am wondering if anyone could use my services within their clinic (or OP mobile practice) for half days 1 -2 days a week at a STEEP discount with the idea that I can come to you for questions/mentorship (nothing significant or structured, but just random questions asked along the way). I would also be willing to cover vacation or time off that you may need, however, not at a steep discount but instead reasonable price. 

I am willing to be creative and flexible if anyone finds value in this offer. 

Thanks!

Also interested in advice on how to manage the fear of quitting because of inconsistent patients but form the standpoint that I do not want to lose skill because I have access to plenty of home health patients to cover finances.

I know this has been posted/asked a while ago but looking for any recent feedback on people who have opened their clinic out of their home, either garage, spare bedroom, walkout basement?? I know there is some zoning requirements to go through with your town, but otherwise worth it? Weird having patients at your house or not a big deal? Would love to chat with someone who has tried it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following as I am in the process of doing this. Treated several people in my spare room which is my gym after my kids go to sleep after my day job. Looking to transfer to the garage. None of my patients felt weird and liked the difference then going to a packed gym full of patients

For those of you who do courses. Do you find paying clients really care that your videos are ones you shoot yourself from an iPhone (good lighting, possibly renting studio space to film) or is it preferred to bite the bullet and pay for a professional to film content. 

If suggestion is for me to film myself, any recommendations on online courses (udemy, etc) to get the best shots? For reference, the videos will be short duration (30s-1min). Ideally want to go cheaper but not lose quality too much

I have a patient that I have seen for multiple orthopedic issues over the years who has recently been having vertigo issues. Her PCP and the ER diagnosed her with BPPV and needs a PT who is well versed in the Epley maneuver.

Thanks in advance!

Hey fellow uncaged clinicians! I am the owner of Freedom Performance, a physical therapy and sports training business in Prescott, Arizona! I’m primarily cash based but do accept Medicare and Workmans Comp.  I am looking for someone to help me with consulting in the medical billing arena. I bill all on my own through PTeverywhere my software.  I am just looking for someone to help me with general questions in regards to maximizing reimbursement with Medicare.  I’m also potentially looking for someone who can follow up with bills and call insurance companies when bills get denied and just generally help with the whole process, which, obviously I despise!  Any help or referrals to the right people would be incredible! Love this group thank you in advance. You guys are all inspiration!

Hello all,
question about receipts (again!)
I had pt give me gratitude tip for massage service. When giving them receipt should I list only my normal rate for massage? Add some kind of subcategory for drive fee, and tip or not include them at all?
They would like to submit receipt to insurance for reimbursement.
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are paying the full amount with debit/credit card (or even now the applepay/phone tap payments) there is an E-paper trail that will be reported anyway, so giving a full accounting on your own receipt is the smart choice. True cash business has more leeway. In any case it is up to the client and their insurer what may be reimbursed. You protect your own tax scenario before trying to advantage the client’s situation.

Has anyone had any issues updating their last name for NPI? A friend is trying to update but is unable to and gets redirected to CMS but has no idea of her account and is hesitant to make a new one as she doesn’t want it to cause any issues 

Is it a big deal if NPI is still showing maiden name ? She also sees Medicare clients

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** She should call them for help. CMS help desk lines answer pretty quickly and they will help you figure it out. It’s certainly recommended to update the NPI to the new name and approprier address but plenty of people I’ve hired had their old name showing and addresses from very past jobs show up. We have always spent the time to update, by calling old employers or the PECOS/CMS folks for help. Many companies aren’t diligent about updating the info.

Not sure how you have them sign up, but i take that mailing list and email them all a promo code to book with me, to push the follow-up and then they have my contact info in their email. I also include detailed info about my practice

And be sure to sell them on why they need to book with you outside of the workshop

Exercise starting at lowest intensity and then teach progression

I have a patient who owes a significant amount of money. She  willing pay (I don't have any doubts) but would like a payment plan. 
She has already paid over $1,000 and has a high deductible. The insurance company just got everything settled, but she was discharged a while ago and still has a remaining balance.
Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? How do you typically handle payment plans for past patients? Any advice or strategies would be greatly appreciated!
(Posting anonymously due to financial matters being discussed.)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Put the plan in writing if possible and send her recurring invoices outlined in the agreement. If they won’t agree to the payment plan then you have every right to send her invoices for the full amount and even send her to collections (collections is a nuclear option that should only be used as a last resort).
I would make sure you keep the payment plan under a year ideally under 6 months. The quicker you can get paid the better.

Hi everyone, I have a base level of awareness of all the new AI tools that are evolving so fast. I’m interested in investing some time and resources into really learning some of the tools.

Any ideas on this ?

**Community Responses:**

So we don’t use it now and conversions seem to be the same or better as they were before. 

So many patients don’t try to submit. It’s just about showing them why your worth it and if they don’t get any reimbursement it’s still worth it

Looking for Phone Solutions- please share what you’re using that you’re HAPPY with? (Even better if you have a team/employees and reply, what works for a solopreneur doesn’t always work w a team, speaking from experience) 

We've been using Ooma but we're having increasing frustrations with them and their texting and call capability (lots of glitches). 

One of my front desk employees suggested Nextiva as she has used it in the past and was happy. I am skeptical of it all because I've been through 3 different services (some very horrid!  **cough cough WEAVE** - back in 2021) 

What do you use and my questions specifically: 
1) how long have you been a customer?
2) is it reliable? any missed calls or dropped texts
3) do you have problems with certain carriers blocking your number (apparently T-mobile automatically blocks us)
4) can you talk to a real live person and overall how is their customer service ( do they SOLVE problems or just send you help articles to figure it out yourself)
5) if you have employees do you HAVE to get a line for everyone or can we get by with logging in and sharing an account if we all have the login details/password?
6) are you able to record incoming and outgoing calls - if so, have you had any problems with this? 
7) does it have both MOBILE and DESKTOP apps and do they work well?
7) anything else you want to add that you wish you had known before porting your number? I really don't want to waste my time 😉

So many questions because I HATE when a system doesn't work like salespeople promise! 

Thanks for your input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, ooma has been bad the last 2 -3 weeks with texting and being able to use the computer app.. no answers. Although the texting has gotten a better this week. Ooma has been the best up until now..  Ring central was a nightmare.. weave was x6 the cost of everyone else… I have been looking as well, but hoping ooma figures it out in the meantime.

Hello I am planning to sublease the extra office space in a 500 sq foot suite. It has two offices and a reception area. The building has plenty of parking, bathrooms and elevator. Has anyone here subleased before and is there a contract involved to make sure there’s no downfall on payments etc. the space is $790 per month and includes utilities. 

Subleaser is an esthetician and I also know her personally. 

All advice is appreciated thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s $19 per square foot per year. Use that number and compare it to other office spaces in the area. You could throw it a little bit more than market if she is reliably going to send you clients.

That said it’s still a risk because if her business slows down, you can’t change the lease

Does anyone accept NYSHIP? I heard reimbursement is good through them so I reached out for more info. The reimbursement rates they sent me were lower than expected (compared to what I heard they reimburse). I currently accept cash, but am exploring insurance options. Does anyone have any experience with NYSHIP? Is it better to remain out of network with them? Thanks in advance for any info!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t accept NYSHiP, they’re out net work reimbursement is the same rate as their in network which is $66. I don’t even offer it for out of network, they still require prior authorization in order to reimburse patients so it’s a lot of work . The deductible is $250 after that they reimburse the patient 50% of their rate, so $33

There's the patient I'm working with that has a femoral Nerve injury. This patient keeps experiencing knee buckling.  Does anyone have a knee brace on Amazon that you would recommend for this? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t have the patient bear full weight through a limb they don’t have full control of. No brace should be that relied upon without supervision, especially recovering from back surgery. Make them TDWB with a walker. It’s predisposing a fall. Directional changes in WB are especially dangerous. It’s not worth it to advance their gait loading fully at this point of their recovery. In exercising, facilitate the nerve recovery but I find encouraging full loading, brace or not gives a false confidence. A hinged knee brace in full extension can be used but I would still limit to 50% with that. 30 years in a hospital doing ortho and Neuro and I’ve prevented many enthusiast MDs and patients from disaster.

> **Response 2:** I’m so sorry your patient is going through this….I’m actually recovering from this myself (complication from back surgery.) I would suggest something similar to a post-op ACL brace that can be locked in full extension, then opened gradually as the quads get stronger.

NEXTIVA QUESTION

Does anyone else have issues with Nextiva calls ? We just realized that both parties have to be off of wifi and on cellular data in order for both of us to hear each other… has this happened to anyone else or does Nextiva work for you regardless of this? 

Thank you 😅😅😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Nextiva is not good for us but I haven't had the time to fight with them. It drops calls after a few minutes, there's a delay in sending the voicemail, etc. I've opened multiple tickets with their help desk and they keep telling me it's an issue with my carrier and to talk to t-mobile. I've talked to t-mobile because I don't have an issue with any of my cell service or data. They directed me back to Nextiva. Nextica keeps saying it works best on stable wi-fi. That's fine for when I'm at home or in the office but I am 75% mobile and I told the sales rep that when we initially set up the account. It's quite unprofessional and I end up just calling the person back through my own cell number instead of via the app.

Hi there everyone, kind of an odd ball question but…
Anyone have any issues wearing gloves to get a patient from an ALF common area? This is the second time this has happened and I’m beginning to think there is some type of regulation I’m unaware of. The first time it happened, I thought it was just ALF preference but they were so nice about it that I chose to comply. This second incident makes me think this is a thing and I could be in the wrong. Anyone know where I can look this up? Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was told I can’t have them but I can’t recall why? It was some sort of regulation type thing if I remember correctly but that was also 2 years ago. I still used them since I had a great deal of incontinent individuals working on transitional mobility. In their rooms I always used them!

> **Response 2:** I know Joint Commission does not allow wearing of PPE (gloves/gowns) outside of patient rooms. For infection control reasons

Can cash based clinics take FSA/HSA payments? Is there anything I need to do as a business to accept these payments?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes you can and should accept them 

You will need to provide them a copy of their receipt with date of service on there as well as codes. Essentially provide superbill every time in the event their HSA or FSA wants a copy. 

Make sure which ever card reader you are using has you registered as a medical provider that way the patient has less hassle from their HSA or FSA company requesting a copy of each and every visit

Does anyone know if JetBlue airlines charges you to put a Rollator on with the baggage or do they take it from you at the gate and then return it to you again upon landing? My parents will be traveling with wheelchairs, but they do need the Rollator to get to the car that will be waiting for them. I’m worried that it will get destroyed. If it’s thrown in with the luggage, I don’t want it to be checked.

Any suggestions thank you?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve only ever seen them gate checked - regardless they go in cargo with luggage, but gate checking them means they go in last at least and are returned to you at the gate instead of getting banged around on the luggage carts/carousel.

> **Response 2:** They shouldn’t. No. They take it at plane.

Hi everyone! Thank you for adding me here! I would love to learn more about branching out and starting on my own 

I want to start offering my physical therapy services to my gym on certain days (weekends, as I have a full time job). I have a foldable plinth and some tools. I love working with this population that wants to get stronger, bigger, has overused injuries. How do I go about it? What are the steps? Do I talk to the manager? I wanted to ask for feedback and familiarise myself with the logistics before I ask to speak to the manager about this opportunity 

All tips are appreciated! Thank you so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Gonna tag Cale Alexander and Sharon Gaffney-Wisnewski because right now my brain is only giving me those two names.

Hopefully they will have more people to bring into the conversation! (And answers for you.)

I’m a solo provider and completely mobile, considering getting a space to be both mobile and in person. I get these thoughts in my head like, can I manage others? Staff? Organize all that? I consider myself an amazing therapist but I know that role changes when you become the owner. I get in my head thinking like, is this even my calling? Do I just continue to be a staff therapist and know I am good at this and just keep at it? Has anyone ever had these feelings and any advice or thoughts ?
To add- I did travel therapy for 5 years and got really use to leaving and always changing which kept me from feeling “stale” or “bored”

Good morning!

I have a case that I feel would benefit from iontophoresis but I am not sure how to get the dexamethasone. Does anyone know how I request it to be written from a physician so that I can use it for the physical therapy practice as a whole?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My old clinic had a general prescription that we always had and could use with anyone so I know it’s possible (but could vary by state maybe). But unfortunately I’m not sure how they did it. I know the prescription was made out to the owner as his name was on the label.

> **Response 2:** I send a fax request to the provider or call their office for said patient. Patient picks up and brings to clinic. I administer and they bring it to and from clinic for appointments. As far as I know you can’t have a general script for dex as it has to be associated with a patient for pharmacy to distribute

Does anyone practice in Tennessee that can provide me a clear answer for working with TennCare enrollees? I am strictly cash-based (can provide superbill for commercial and Tricare Select only). I have started getting a number of physician referrals for TennCare enrollees. I tried speaking with a representative of TennCare and they just said it depends on the individual's plan. The last potential patient I spoke with said she would check her plan, but never followed up. 

I am a relatively new practice and still getting my name out there. I don't like to turn people away, but also want to make sure I am playing by the rules. Thank you!

Hey! Superbill question for you all…

A patient submitted their superbill and the insurance came back asking for a Place of Service code. It’s a 2 digit code. Anyone know what that would be for outpatient PT? From what I am seeing I’d be considered 62 but I’d love for people to confirm this before submitting it back. 

Thank you!

I want to hire a super casual PRN contract PT to see maybe 1-4 patients/week. I am an OT and personal trainer so I need someone to evaluate and do a few sessions on my patients coming in with more complex orthopedic issues that are a bit beyond my knowledge. 

Where do I find this potential therapist? People looking for more stable part time or full time jobs are the ones looking at the standard job search engines. I moved so don’t have any personal contacts. I used to work for a huge outpatient company with 3 of their clinics not far from me. Is it unprofessional or crossing boundaries to reach out to these clinics and see if they know of anybody? In my mind this is the perfect job for someone who took a break to raise kids and transition slowly back into working or someone who needs extra cash to pay off loans.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Someone in your phone knows someone. (Statistically speaking.)

Definitely harder when you just moved, but I would start with whatever friends/coworkers/clients/etc. you've already got in the area (or familiar with the area). Reach out and tell them briefly who you're looking for and see if they know anyone, or anyone who knows anyone.

I still help folks make connections in places I've lived in the past, even though I haven't lived there in years. Even connections for places I've NEVER lived, just by activating my own network of people (who know people, who know people, who heard about exactly the type of person being sought out).

On that note, where are you located? 😁

Please help!
I have an iPad Pro that I try to do my documentation on.  I have an off-brand keyboard that is supposed to function like the Magic Keyboard.  When I am typing on the separate keyboard, the on-screen keyboard will frequently/  randomly pop up on the screen, I will have to close it down, sometimes I have to re-click the section I was working on to be able to start typing again.  It is so disruptive and very annoying; it makes it very hard to get a note done.  Does anyone else have this problem?
I have tried to find a setting to completely turn off/deactivate the on-screen keyboard but I haven't seemed to figure out how to do that.
*I do have "Full Keyboard Access" enabled.
*"Assistive Touch" is turned off and the "Show onscreen keyboard" setting is turned off under the Assistive touch settings
I am wondering if it is because the keyboard loses connectivity and the onscreen keyboard tries to take over?
Or is it because I'm using a knock-off and not an actual Magic Keyboard?
Can any one offer any advice:
Either how to completely de-activate the onscreen keyboard,
Or do you actually have a Magic Keyboard and don't have this problem?  (I just don't want to buy a Magic Keyboard to find out it does it, too).

**Original Post:**
I have a question for my Oklahoma colleagues (or anyone in a state with limited direct access). I’m trying to figure out how to structure my POC for physician signature since our state requires physician approval if we treat beyond 30 days. My understanding has always been that the POC has to include frequency and duration since it is essentially a “prescription.” For example, I would do once/week for 8 weeks, and I’m bound by the actual dates on those 8 weeks. It doesn’t count as 8 visits that can be used anytime the patient wants. If they miss visits, they can’t make it up on the back end.

In another FB group, I’ve been having a discussion about packages. I’m considering offering package options for 4, 8, or 12 visits, but with my client population (pregnancy and postpartum), visits may be every other week or monthly or just whenever they find the time. I would love to just put “PT for 4 visits” on my plan of care, but I’m not sure that will count for our direct access rules. How do you handle that and how do you write your POC? My practice is self-pay, so I’m not bound by any insurance rules. But I’ve worked under an insurance model for 14 years and don’t quite know what I’ve always done because it is required by our practice act vs what I’ve done because it’s required by insurance. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you have a general idea of what you want, can you not do like 4mo2 or something like that?  That way as long as you technically see them 4x per month it can be any week you want.

> **Response 2:** I have seen therapists in cash pay type POC for “10 visits at 1x/wk, adjusted as needed” and put no specific end date, BUT I am with you in not knowing the exactness for how long that entails/covers. And when considering patients who are seen 1x/mo would the same format be appropriate and how does that impact progress note frequency? Questions I am asking myself and my colleagues 🤔

Hello , I am a new outpatient private practice owner!! I am seeking information , relevant advise , guides , and or valuable information about authorizations . I have been training my front desk staff about authorizations and how to obtain those prior authorization and if the provider needs information for future Auth etc. I believe there is a disconnect or valuable information missed . I am looking for help or resources to help with  daily check list for the task of the positions and resources for authorization.. if anyone can provide assistant please dm me or comment here . Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is a hard one. Our EMR will show when we are coming up on the end of the script/auth (we save the auth as a script to keep us updated as well) but you have to be in the note and pay attention to it, it doesn’t necessarily flag you. 
I have 3 girls who obtain auth, but for the most part I am the one who keeps all of them in check and make sure we are obtaining it when we need to. I have a spreadsheet of every patient that requires auth with all visits and dates included. I check it almost daily and send an email to my girls to obtain auth when needed. 
You have to pay attention because auth days can change due to cancellations and reschedules. 
It’s time consuming, but this is the only way I have found to ensure we are obtaining auth when needed, otherwise it goes missed and it’s a nightmare.

Hey everyone — I’m currently doing home physical therapy, but I’m exploring the idea of having access to a medical professional space where I can also see patients who don’t have a gym in their building.

Ideally, I’m looking for a Midtown Manhattan location with:
 • A private treatment room
 • Gym or exercise area for patient sessions
 • Options to rent per patient, half-day, or daily rate (flexible arrangements preferred)

If anyone knows of spaces that rent to healthcare providers (PT, OT, chiro, massage, etc.), or has personal recommendations or feedback, I’d really appreciate your input!

Good morning! Does anyone have any insights into credentialing with BCBS (Pennsylvania) -- trying to get some answers if the correct application would be provider credentialing vs. organizational credentialing (mobile outpatient therapy). If anyone has any other general insights and tips for this process as well, that would be greatly appreciated!!!

Thanks all😀

So question for anyone who has just opened an outpatient practice. How many patients would you consider too many when doors open. I am in the unusual spot of having a chiro practice close and patients seeing my sign out front opening soon. Now have 25 patients interested. Which I guess is good but still setting up and need to reverify and then enter all the info into EMR which still learning. Just curious if anyone else has been in this situation and how they handled it.  Dont want to be like all other facilities in area which are corporate. Oh and we are OON and medicare but some of chiro was MVA patients.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are in charge of scheduling. 

Could set a weekly visit cap for yourself (e.g., no more than x visits total for a given week) to get your feet under you. It would create a waiting list which is fine, and most anyone should understand that you are a one person show just getting started. 

Could have a special event to do brief consults with everyone interested to see if they're a good fit and would benefit most from your services vs someone else's.

Could post your prices and let some of them self select themselves out of the process (always view this as a "no for now").

Exciting problem to have!! Congrats on the early interest.

For those who offer packages of a specified number of visits- how do you keep track of how many visits have been used and start/end dates? A traditional spreadsheet or is there better technology than that?

Greetings Uncaged Clinicians! 
 
I'm a physical therapist and I support my colleagues who want to work as virtual assistants. I was just wondering if you might need a virtual assistant to help you with administrative duties, insurance verification, medical coding, quality assurance, scheduling appointments, PT scribing and social media advertisements. They can definitely assist you with it. If you need a virtual assistant to help you manage your business, please do message me. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day.

Greetings, Clinicians! 
 
I'm a physical therapist and I support my colleagues who want to work as virtual assistants. I was just wondering if you might need a virtual assistant to help you with administrative duties, insurance verification, quality assurance, scheduling appointments, PT scribing and social media advertisements. They can definitely assist you with it. If you need a virtual assistant to help you manage your business, please do message me. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day.

Anyone utilize Bark.com for referrals?
I had a lead email me through them. Apparently the site put up my very basic info into a profile. Of course, it's a "free trial" right now and they let me contact the prospective patient. 
I generally don't like paying for things like this but if it's worth it I might consider it. Otherwise I'll have to ask them to delete my listing as I don't want people messaging me who I can't reply to because I refuse to pay for the contact info. 
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I tried it. But it was for online health coaching. Got overwhelmed with leads … like 50 per day. I sent out probably 50 replies and didn’t get one consult booked. It was a waste of money for me!! And Crowded up my email 😝. Maybe if I had a VA at the time that could have followed up it would have been more successful…

Hello all! I am in a peculiar circumstance and need advice.
1. I am PAR with medicare, however I rent space out a gym and I do not have a private treatment space (my understanding is that to see medicare patients in an office space, it has to be designated for therapy purposes only). I went PAR with medicare when I was mobile, but I'm not mobile anymore.
1. I am a vestibular specialist, I have specialized equipment including infrared goggles and specialized virtual reality system to help with assessment.  

I have a lead who wants to see me but has medicare, I tried turning him away and referring out, but he wants to pay cash for the assessment and for use of this specialized equipment. (*I cannot travel to his home with the equipment, I tried, and that's why I stopped being mobile*)

What is everyone's thoughts about this? Charge him for "wellness" services for the use of the equipment and refer him out afterwards? I promised him I would find out as much information as I could so I appreciate anyone who can help point me in a direction.  Thank you!

Has anyone here been hired to a wellness/ performance facility where everyone is an independent contractor (PTs, chiropractors, personal trainers, etc.) and like how they navigated the beginnings of it?

I’m currently transitioning from travel PT to seeking a job in my residential city and am in the application process to this certain facility. From what it sounds like all the PTs charge their own rates and build up their own clientele. Does anyone have any advice on where should I start (if I get this position) and like how to begin? I will admit I’m a little lost (and intimidated) so any guidance would be great! 😌

𝐁𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐃𝐄𝐑…

Being a leader doesn't mean you stand on top of a mountain and yell down to those hiking and say "YOU CAN DO IT" 

Being a leader means leaving the mountain top to help those on the journey. 

𝑩𝒆𝒄𝒂𝒖𝒔𝒆, 𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒍𝒚, 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒉𝒊𝒑 𝒊𝒔𝒏’𝒕 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖.

Which is why so few people really want to become better leaders. 

They want the benefits that often-time are accompanied by being in a leadership position but they don't want the messy-ness and challenges of actually leading. 

Our professions (PT, OT, SLP, Chiro, Massage, etc) and, honestly, the world needs more leaders. 

We have terrible examples all around us of "leaders" who are simply using their place of power for their own gain, or are afraid to actually implement important and meaningful change. 

𝑾𝒆 𝒏𝒆𝒆𝒅 𝒑𝒆𝒐𝒑𝒍𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒑 𝒖𝒑.

Which is why my partner, Kevin DeGroot, is hosting the 6 week 𝙇𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥 𝙄𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙫𝙚 starting next Wednesday morning, 𝗝𝘂𝗻𝗲 𝟭, and we want you to be a part of it. 

If you're ready to LEAD, comment "𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗𝗬" below and I'll reach out with more information.

Struggling on this end.  Paralyzed by self-consciousness, fear of failure and fear of the unknown.  Major imposter syndrome.  Also sucks having no direct connections to rely on for legal, billing, entrepreneurship advice.  Having made some bad decisions on expenses already making it difficult to move forward.  Just want some small successes to help move along but mentally realizing all the things I need to do… overwhelming as hell.

Hi is anyone here a foot specialist or work in that field. Asking for myself. Somehow, my phone heard me mention my toe spacers and I just saw 3 ads for bunion corrector. Does anyone know if they really work or do you have favorite brands? Fir me, it's genetic. My whole family is born with them.

Anyone familiar with the "Quality Business Awards"? I received an email from them, and it felt a little scammy but I thought I would see what others thought about it? You basically pay $50 to get access to their digital marketing material saying that you won and they post all of your information on their website, but I'm wondering if that's actually worthwhile? My info was already on their site and linked as "Best OT in Brookhaven"

Question for other California PT business owners: who are you using for payroll services (ideally as cheap as possible)? 

I have my own practice to have control over my schedule. I work only 3-5 hours a week, and as such, make very little money. I have one employee who works occasionally when I am gone on vacation/maternity leave, but he also only sees 1-2 patients a week, and thus, makes very little money from my business. 

Last year, I used Paychex which worked for some things, but was a nightmare for others. I just signed up with Gusto, but after speaking to customer service, they don’t think they’re a good fit due to the cost at $70/month and I have months of the year that neither myself or my employee work at all. 

Is running payroll something an accountant can do for me at a reasonable price? I understand this probably depends on the accountant, but just want to hear others experiences. 

Thanks!

Clinical advice
Helping a patient with minimal resources and its out of my wheelhouse of knowledge.

Living indep with daily caregivers hired. Left side hemiplegia. No use of left UE. Minimal left hip flexion. Flaccid ankle.  Right side wnl.  She lives indep, obese and unhealthy.  She can function “okay” once someone helps her don the afo and place it in the shoe. She can actually don the afo indep but cant maneuver it in her orthotic shoe.  Any adaptive equipment out there to help slide her left foot in the shoe using just right side? Otherwise she is trapped in bed waiting for caregivers to show up.

Hello everyone - I need some help with my Medicare application. I turned in my application a while back, and I just got a response saying "Please provide a correct answer to Question 4 in the Physical Therapists/Occupational Therapists in Private Practice (PT/OT) section of your application."

Does that mean I have to fill out another application form to provide the correct answer? I didn't get any guidance at all and I've been trying to call but no one's available to help. 

Thank you in advance!

Anyone practicing in Monterey Park (CA 91754) or nearby area in LA? Or offering mobile services to that area? (And ideally utilizing Pilates for treatment)
I have a family member that has spinal canal stenosis and L4/L5 spondylolisthesis for years. I have been given her generic exercise instructions virtually, but I think that we are reaching a point of needing consistent PT followed with Pilates (wellness/maintenance) for core stabilization to prevent the condition from getting worse. I don't know anyone in that area but I would be more than happy to pass on information to her.
Thanks in advance for your response!

What's happening here:  
(With permission)
This late 30's, Navy Vet is wondering what's causing these vocal ticks.  I'm a massage therapist and I haven't a clue.  He's isolated and reluctant to seek help (PTSD?).  
I told him that if he made a video that I would share it with my amazing PT network.

My massage treatments have been to address chronic pain and muscle imbalance, and to help down regulate his SNS.   Which is helping but has not seemed to lessen these vocal impulses any.

**Community Responses:**

Hi all, I am trying to brainstorm alternative ways of generating revenue for my 1 person mobile clinic.  I faintly remember reading on this page about a certification that somebody obtained to be able to evaluate employees for readiness to return back to work after an injury.  I can’t remember what that certification was called.  Does this sound familiar to anyone and know what this certification is called?  Does anyone have experience with this?  I do remember the post made it sound like it was a pretty good revenue generator and the PT may have even done this full time.  Is anyone willing to offer other ideas of clinical ways to generate additional income for a 1 person mobile company while I am still growing and have a smaller caseload.  Besides wellness coaching, personal training, nutrition…. Thank you!!

Hello all!
I have a very specific question that I'm hoping someone in this group has experience with.
I have dual citizenship but live and work in the U.S. only. I recently got asked if I do consultations and appointments over telehealth by someone overseas. I responded that I do not as I'm not licensed in that country.
Does anyone have experienced getting licensed in another country and only providing Telehealth from a home base in the states? Is this even an option? 
It's something I never considered or thought about but there's a large expat population in that country who tend to ask about therapy services so thought I would reach out to see if anyone had any experience with this. Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You will need to check with the PT board of the respective country, as each country's laws will be different. Good luck!

For those who offer separate wellness services:

1) this can be done for anyone, correct? Meaning my pt llc i don’t take medicare bc i am cash based but for wellness i could see someone who has Medicare since it isn’t a covered service, correct?

2) what type of wellness services do you all offer? Does anyone here do group wellness classes? 

3) Do you still have them fill out PMH?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Happy to chat :) 

1) You can do wellness for anyone! 

2) health coaching - customized supplements and DNA testing along with fitness programs. We also offer Sauna and cryo in the clinic 

3) yes and no depending on the service

**Community Responses:**

Advice needed... For insight I provide mobile outpatient physical therapy. I occasionally get calls from Optum community care scheduling on behalf of VA patients. They want to confirm my clinic location, which I do not have, as this address is only what I use to get mail.
Has anyone had any luck seeing VA patients as a mobile outpatient therapist? I am often stuck explaining to the schedulers the difference between home health and mobile outpatient and I haven't been able to get a consistent answer as to whether this is allowed through the VA.
Thank you for any help/advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The va pays pretty good I don't know the legality of it we get va community care patients but we are brick and mortar.  I didn't know you could have a mobile outpatient practice though either

For those of you who do courses. Do you find paying clients really care that your videos are ones you shoot yourself from an iPhone (good lighting, possibly renting studio space to film) or is it preferred to bite the bullet and pay for a professional to film content. 

If suggestion is for me to film myself, any recommendations on online courses (udemy, etc) to get the best shots? For reference, the videos will be short duration (30s-1min). Ideally want to go cheaper but not lose quality too much

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve filmed exercise demos for courses with my iPhone and with a Logitech webcam in my home office and there have been no complaints. 

In my experience, my clients care about the content, not the production since my audience is mainly looking for stuff they can do at home

Anyone have any tips/ tools for how they manage remote assistants?  Right now, I’m using Google Workspace tools (Chat/ Spaces/ Calendar) to communicate and I have procedure documents in the Google Spaces app so they can reference how to do things. I can assign them tasks on Google Tasks. I’m using a Google chat widget with which they can clock in. And I manually will enter their clock-ins/ outs into Square to pay them. What should I be considering in terms of making sure they’re working when they’re clocked in?  And how do you manage having to ask them the same things a few times?  Even asking them what hours they worked can take a while to get an answer.

Hi Everyone!
I'm looking for a wrist brace for a patient that has osteoporosis and hx of wrist fx. We are to try to get her more active but also protect her wrist. Doctor asked that we do this if we plan to do any weight bearing. Preferably off amazon for ease of ordering but not a requirement.
Thanks!
Emma

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** From years of wearing one I’d like to say that a rigid wrist brace affects the persons ability to use their hand correctly and they will compensate from elbow, shoulder, neck.  They will not be able to hold weights or put weight through the hand.  I suggest looking for something flexible

Has anyone approached a Direct Primary Care Practice and pitched a "partnership". We work closely with one- share referrals- but I'm would love for our PT services to be included in their monthly membership. I'm getting caught up on the logistics and approaching the director about this. Has anyone done this? Tips? Pros/Cons? TIA!

Posting anonymously only so my competitors don't know what we're up to ;)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did, but I didn’t ask to be included in their direct care, just for referrals for those patients. In the case of this clinic, they charge $60 per month for the membership. I don’t see how that would be profitable for me as a mobile practitioner. I approached them from the “I see patients that need a primary care provider and we have xyz in common, so can I learn more about your practice and potentially refer clients to you”. They loved it and learned about me in the process. I offered a discount for patients that they referred to me through that.

Hi uncaged! 
I need some help! 

In the State of Texas, how often the PT should see the patient when the service is provided by PTA, in out patient settings. 

( rather than the re-eval every 60 days) 

Thank you!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As long as you aren’t dealing with an insurance payor, just by state practice act/rules. I prefer to see the patient once every 4 weeks.

Dan - Suggest setting up [required] an Exposure Control Plan for your practice. Resulting from that establish BBP training. This is how I establish in my P & P manuals.  For those clients where I developed the training, it was based on required Exposure Control Plan, and OSHA guidance specific to PT clinics.

**Community Responses:**

Good morning! I have a patient who is very HOH & she inquired about a TTY phone. Her daughter lives across the country & said patient cannot carry on a conversation on the phone due to her inability to hear her daughter clearly on the phone.  I remember I had a patient years ago that had one with the feature that whatever the person on the other line was saying, it showed up as a text on the phone so she could read what the other person was saying. This would be a tremendous help for my current patient. Does anyone know how I would go about helping this patient obtain one? Any idea about cost?  I am in North Carolina. Thank you!

Has anyone else experienced major delays (and lack of communication) with credentialing with BCBS?  

We started the process in April and completed the online application. Within a week we received notice that 2 of the 6 or so contracts have been added and have heard nothing since. I have called multiple times and was told if you submitted online you cannot speak directly with someone over the phone and need to make “case comments” within your application. I have submitted numerous comments over and over and either the case is closed with zero correspondence or we did hear back stating someone would be in contact but never hear from anyone. I have also called and asked for a manager and was told that they would leave a message and did not receive a call back. This has been ongoing since April. 

Thanks in advance!

My biz partner Ashley and I were presented with an opportunity to work with another wellness/ gym on providing PT for their clients before they use their vasper technology which is a combo of BFR and cryotherapy during biking (kinda like a nustep).  They want us to be the PT on staff to provide evaluations for injuries and physical therapy then when they are fit to perform the Vasper we get them to use the machines for this type of training. They do have weights, other exercise equipment that we can use for our mutual clients. 

They do have self pay membership model etc and wanted to get into the insurance game of taking medicare and using their equipment with providing physical therapy services. We are working on discussing that further. We personally are a medicare provider. 
Our question is has anyone leased a space or used another company's equipment, how do you work this out and be compliant with Medicare? I know we have to have exclusive use of the space during the hours of care. 

Does this eliminate the possibility of paying them per patient because this could be seen as a kick back?

Calling solo practices! Im in the process of opening a satellite pelvic floor clinic with my current cooperate employer. I planned on having part time front desk help for scanning/faxing/phone/ etc however they are wanting to have someone with me at the space at all times. I don’t mind the help but to be honest theyll be bored and it’s a big expense I don’t think is necessary. With being pelvic floor I have every patient sign a consent to treat and a consent for internal exam with an option to opt in or out of having a witness. If they wanted a witness I would obviously hold the exam until someone could be present. 

Wondering if anyone has any words of advice/insight on how to approach this? Legality/liability/etc. 

Thanks in advance!

Are you an entrepreneur in the healthcare field looking for office space in a team based environment with other therapy disciplines?

Touchstone Rehab has office space for lease that would also allow shared space of our 7000 sq ft therapy building.  

Would be an amazing opportunity for speech therapy practice, massage therapy, personal training , psychologist, counselor , Nurse Infusion or DME rep.

For those using shockwave (radial or focused):

* What diagnoses does it genuinely help with in your clinic?
* Are outcomes consistent enough to justify the cost?
* Has it improved patient satisfaction or revenue?
* Anything you wish you knew before buying?

Happy Saturday, Uncaged crew! 🦁

Hope everyone’s getting at least a little time this weekend to enjoy life outside the clinic.

I’d really appreciate some help with something important. My longtime accountant is retiring, and I’m looking for a new accountant who can really partner with me – both for my PT business and my personal finances.

I’ve asked friends, family, patients… and surprisingly have come up empty-handed. So I’m coming to the hive mind here, because word-of-mouth + Uncaged validation is worth more to me than a random Google search.

I’m looking for someone who:
 • Understands small healthcare / PT      
            practices (ideally cash-based or out-of-
            network)
 • Can strategize and optimize, not just file 
            taxes
 • Is proactive about tax planning, entity 
            structure, and deductions
 • Is clear and patient with explanations (I 
            don’t mind homework, I just want to 
            understand the plan)

I’m based in Bergen County, NJ, and can travel to neighboring counties for the right, ultra-legit person. I’m also open to someone working virtually if they’re truly excellent and come highly recommended.

If you have an accountant you absolutely love and trust with your business + personal stuff, I’d be so grateful if you could drop their name/firm below or DM me their info.

Thank you all in advance – really appreciate this community. 🙏

Anyone able to go there to see her either under her insurance (Braven Health) primary or family is willing to pay cash if needed. It will be for about 1 month to 1.5 month length time she needs to continue her rehab as its too far for me to travel. She will be in Paramus NJ.

Reducing Low Back, SI and Pelvic Girdle Pain During Pregnancy and Postpartum 

And 
Posture and Physical Therapy for Breast Feeding and Recurrent Clogs

I’m trying to consider which would get me the best follow up. Obviously the first will be chock full of info and give people a good idea of what I know, but potentially the second gets more people to call me when they have acute clogs. There are a few other PTs also presenting, I know one is presenting on Spinning Babies, not sure about the others.

It’s in a hippy town and the audience is midwives, doulas, therapists and pregnant and postpartum women.

Happy to hear anyone who has experience or even if there are any pregnant people which they would want to attend.

Has anyone ever purchased a local small boutique gym with the intention of keeping it as a gym but also using as a wellness clinic/ PT clinic complete with name change and such?

Question about storing papers via using Google Workspace

1) intake forms/copies of insurance/ ID: some patients will fill out the paper forms and I will scan them into their folders on the workspace ..do I still need to hold on to the actual papers or can shred? 

2) do I need to keep Medicare / other insurances payment receipts that is sent to me with payment (Medicare is on Novitas website) in the patient's file as well or can be shredded?

3) where do you do files  backup if using G..Workspace? 

Appreciate the feedback!

Hi Everyone,

I am a PT who is hybrid cash/contractes with a few insurance companies. I am looking to hire an OT to come in for like 3-5 hours one day a week. They would likely be paid per patient seen, but I am so new to this process I was looking for any advice. How much would be a fair going rate or percentage per individual seen? 
The other question I have is, would I have to go through the process of credentialing them with the insurances I take or is that not necessary as they would be billing under the facility/group NPI?
Thank you for your help!

Hey so has anyone been able to cancel card connect and receive a refund from them? 

We set up our account back in March and were working with hellonote to get them linked. In the process we noticed they were charging us $30 a month which we found out was because we are not charging the minimum...spoke to a customer service representative at card connect, sent in our cancelation request and it was not taken care of by this rep for 2 months. Fast forward to August and they charged us a 229.99 fee for their yearly fee, which we were able to fight and get back. BUT since then all calls regarding our initial refund have gotten us no where. They owe us 250 dollars (which was confirmed that we would receive by this initial rep) and now are saying they don't know the person that closed our account and they are not associated with them. Which is fishy because somehow they were able to close our account....but they don't know the guy who closed it. 

Anyways. Has anyone had luck getting their money back? And has anyone ever had to put in a claim with the bbb. We have had such an awful experience and it's so shady that we feel it necessary, but we don't want them to come back at us and destroy our business or doing that. 

That was a lot. Thanks for reading!

I’m looking for a PT in the Smithville/Stoney creek area in Ontario, Canada. 

I have a family member in the area who appears to have long Covid.  He’s been out of commission for the past few months and just had an MRI that cleared him neurologically. He’s relieved in that regard, but anxiety is really weighing him down. I know he’d like to get back to work. Is there anyone here who is in that area that he could connect with? Preferably with experience in treating long Covid. 

Thanks!

Liability insurance question… yes I know this is asked a ton… yes I searched the group first.

In Indiana we have a Patient Compensation Fund we can participate in (non-mandatory).  However, with participation this is making my professional and general liability a mess with CM&F because I have to have a group policy and myself as additional insured, vs the other way around for a solo practitioner.  And by messy I also mean much more expensive.  Doesn’t help that I’m a border state provider so am dual liscensed (but frankly they better get it together with IN joining the COMPACT and MI not far behind).  

So my questions really are, has anyone dealt with or have opinions regarding participating in the fund?  It’s a nice safeguard but is it overkill for the headache it’s creating?  Any other plans that may have more realistic coverage for my needs?  I’m quoted almost $900 and it would add over $400 more to cover my prn jobs that don’t fall under my business.  We are getting kinda pricey at $1300 to be fully covered for lil ‘ol me.

Hi All!

I own an out-of-network PT office outside of Boston, MA and one of my employees is going out on maternity leave soon. If anyone here is either just starting out and is looking for some part time work, or is thinking about taking the plunge and wants to get some experience/mentorship in this arena first, I figured there is a chance this opportunity could be mutually beneficial!

If you are in the area and interested, feel free to reach out to me at joe@advancedmanualpt.com.

Thanks!
Joe

Hello! 
Question for CA based therapists:
what is the rule regarding providing services to MediCal or CCS patients? Is it the same as Medicare ? Are we able to treat these patients cash based? 
Thanks in advance!

Hi
Looking for some advice on how to structure this right. I have my business registered in my home city. I’m planning to sublease a room for one day a week in the city that’s 30 minutes away. 

How do I put this under my business as one day service by appointment only? Do I have to add it as a separate location for my insurance? I am accepting Medicare, but not for this location. Is there any other legal requirements to be filled if I’m in state of Florida?

Any Advice is highly appreciated🙏🙏

Thank you 🙏

Seeking Guidance: Closing PT Practice (Not Selling)
Hi everyone! I'm looking for advice from anyone who has experience with closing a physical therapy practice in California. I'm relocating and need to temporarily close my entity, with the possibility of reopening in a new location down the road.

Has anyone been through this process and could share insights on:

* What steps/considerations I might be overlooking

* Whether there are reliable resources or checklists to follow

* Any major pitfalls to avoid during the closure process

I'm not looking to sell the practice - just need to properly wind things down while keeping my options open for the future.

Would greatly appreciate any guidance or if you could point me toward helpful resources. Feel free to comment here or DM me.

Thanks in advance for your help! 🙏

I realize I am posting anonymously so you may not be able to message me but leave me a message here and I’ll message you 🩷

Tldr: VOIP for INTERNATIONAL VAs?

For those with international virtual assistants who take calls, how are you doing this? I’m currently using Sideline but realized I may get charged extra if they detect my VA is in Europe (she was my admin in person but moved to EU recently, still will be working for me remotely, so we’re navigating this change together without prior VA experience). I actually don’t think Sideline allows use of their app outside of the US.

I have been thinking of switching to a different VOIP system anyway (probably Grasshopper) but now realizing this dilemma, does anyone have a specific VOIP system where you & your VA can access the same phone number? TIA!

I am part of a pain management company, but the PT department operates as an outpatient facility. I was wondering the requirements of having a State Operations Manual for Medicare. Does anyone have a contact for compliance they are willing to share?

Hello! Background info: i live very close to the Iowa/Illinois state lines and see patients on both sides of the river. 

I am in network with my local BCBS plan and have had 0 issues submitting out of state plans to my local plan and getting reimbursed. I have an upcoming new patient with a PPO plan and I went to Availity to check her benefits and it states I’m OON. I called BCBS and went through all of the automated prompts and it says that physical therapy office visit services aren’t covered. It’s impossible to get anybody through BCBSIL on the phone. Patient also told me that I pop up as in network in her provider search portal.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? Thanks so much!

Hi group. Need some advice from PTs that have their own clinic and bill Medicare. When looking at local office spaces to rent, how do you navigate the ADA compliance if you want to get certified as a Medicare provider? There is a space I looked at that has ramp entry and parking, but what if the bathroom isn't big enough to accommodate a wheelchair turn space? Did anyone go through being certified and their space surveyed help me with this question? I am wondering if I'm missing some key points here .Thank you.

 I’m a PT that practiced in Indiana before I moved to Pennsylvania area about a year ago. I have been able to dry needle in Indiana for 8+ years.

We discussed having a day 1-2 times a year where I could come in and screen the children. I would write up a quick summary with my contact information on the bottom of it and next steps. Has anyone done something similar? Would I charge a flat rate for my time there or do it for "free" and hope to get some referrals out of it? Thanks!

Hi all,
If anyone has taken Mckenzie exam , I have few questions? If you can help me, I wanted to know if you get the result in the same day of the exam? How many hours you need for the actual exam and did you have enough time to answer all the questions? How difficult did you find the practice part exam?
Thank you in advance!

Looking to see if anyone has any further insight on the changes coming up with UHC on 9/1.

We are OON and only provide PT services. 

Does anyone know if that will require prior auth with this change as we have never had to request auth in the past?

We also read a Patient Summary Form may be required, but unsure if that would only be for in-network providers as it was previously?

I called UHC for clarification and they were zero help and basically told me that we would have to call on every patient individually to find out 🤪

If you are using it, any tips on ways to increase engagement with patients? And any legal disclosures you use?

Need advice…
I was thinking about starting a passport idea in our business development with some of the businesses near us. 
Ex: us, a massage company, a restaurant, an IV place, etc 
So I would find out what service they would want to provide on the passport ($10 off, a 1 hour massage, etc) 
I would sell the passport where people can use those services. How much do you think that I should keep to myself since I’m the one setting this up? 
Would we upcharge for the card to make up for the discount on the card? Or do we drop the price a little in hopes it’ll be a repeated customer? 
Has anyone seen anything like this? Or do you do this? Any and all ideas are welcome.
Thank you

Hello, I am in NJ and I work for a small company that treats patients in their homes through insurance or Med B. I have a patient who is very unsafe in the home. Pt does not follow safety instructions, pt has dementia, pt can be wet and soiled and does not realize it. Pt's family know pt is unsafe but they say pt cannot afford help. I looked at the practice act and I do not see specifics about this type of scenario. Where can I find specific information about mandatory reporting of a patient that is unsafe? Are there specific criteria that constitute mandatory reporting? Thank you in advance for your help.

Hello Everyone! 
I am in need of a recommendation for a client who will be moving to Flat Rock, NC in Henderson County NC. 
She has aetna or cigna insurance, and looking for recommendations for PT clinics that take her insurance. She would be fine with mobile but will be up in the mountains so if someone travels there that would be amazing. She will be treated for hip and knee, she had hip and knee replacements in the past and still  has  deficits. 

She will have to switch orthopedic doctors too to take over her care and let me know who you recommend as orthopedics. 

Thank you so much!

I want to offer  4 sessions during the month of June, at the CrossFit gym I treat out of for youth athletes and would need to have some kind of consent/liability form for the parents to sign.  Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance!

I am a solo owner of a brick & mortar outpatient practice. I accept Medicare only for now. Does anyone of you practicing in California accept other private insurances ? 
I was curious as to which insurance company in California has the best reimbursement rates and if I should consider being in network with them. 
Thanks in advance !

Morning! All my clinicians are contract and therefore don't have set productivity expectations, however I know that adhering to the recommended POC frequency is an area that I would like all of them to improve on. Is anyone aware of a CMS requirement or expectation regarding adherence to POC frequency? For example, one therapist's POC frequency is 1.75/week but she is averaging 1.2 visits per week. I'm hoping there is a metric somewhere to tell me if this is acceptable or not. Thank you in advance!

I’ve been asked to do an open hours at a local studio that I rent space from (I rent hourly per session at 30$ per session). It’s very exciting but I’ve never done this before so wondering what this groups thoughts were on the matter. I’d be performing quick assessments (30min “appointment” slots) of the gym’s members. The gym owner will pay me for my time. I was wondering if I should give a discount as I might be picking up clients from this event and it is a 3 hour event. 

Also does anyone have a simple waiver they’d be able to share or resources on how to create one?

Thanks so much in advance!

The patient is a warehouse manager so his employees do a lot of repetitive movements and lifting throughout the work day. I’ve never been involved in something like this but do not want to turn down the opportunity.

Do any of you have experience with this? In general, what would a full workplace assessment look like? What do you charge?

￼ does anyone have any recommendations on how to create an invoice with a minimum payment due on it. For example, someone who has a balance of say over $1000, rather than saying balance due $1000, some sort of minimum payment due $125 or something along those lines. The program I use just generates the statement with the total versus minimum payment due. Does anyone use any type of website or anything to generate a statement that might have a minimum payment due part? ￼

Looking for some guidance from your fellow OTA

I have an interview for a full time clinical liaison position however, I am feeling slightly inadequate. I have only been an OTA for 4 years in the home health setting. Is this a normal feeling? 

Has anyone switched to a position similar? Any specific pros and cons?

Probably a redundant question, but if we have no relationship with Medicare, are we able to treat Medicare beneficiaries using skilled techniques and charge cash if they have pain/dysfunction that only interferes with recreational tasks? Doesn’t impede there daily function in any way? If they are only seeking preventative services?  

If the answer is yes, are there any particular forms we should be having clients sign since these services are technically non-covered by MC anyways?

Thanks!  This topic hurts my brain

Hey everyone! 

Looking for someone in the morris county NJ area (near Passaic/Essex county), or anyone in general specializing in adolescent scoliosis. Would love to pick your brain and see what options are out there since it’s not really my area of expertise. 

She is a 15 y/o girl with a 40 degree curve, MD is recommending tethering surgery but family would like to avoid surgery and stay conservative. She tried scroth but curve progressed. She’s nearing spinal maturity so was told bracing wasn’t an option. 

They have specific questions about CLEAR but I don’t know anything about it and I can’t tell if it’s just a sham or legit from looking online. Also if anyone is in the area, do you have a adolescent spine doc you would recommend for a second opinion? I don’t think they would mind a bit of a drive for someone recommended. 

Thank you all in advance!

Hi everyone! Looking for guidance on what to form our business as. Right now we’re an OT and PT starting our home based neuro therapy company. We are in NY and thinking of a PLLC, however because we are not hiring employees does anyone know if we can just form a DBA for now? We are mainly looking at what is the best to start off with to help us with taxes and to be an “official” entity. Thank you!

Help me dismantle all of this information, please! 
What are your thoughts: 
Professional corporation vs. Sole proprietorship in California as an occupational therapist offering mobile/concierge services as a “side hustle” to start with. I do not expect to make more than $10k this year. 

 Background: not married, no kids, don’t own a home yet. I have yet to talk with a CPA, still searching for someone that is knowledgeable on health related mobile practice. 
Additionally, if I choose SP,
   Do I need to file for EIN? 
   Do I “pay myself” from my business account or  let that money sit there for business related purchases? 
Can I only write off tax deductions with a PC vs SP? 

I really appreciate everyone’s insight, the internet is a confusing place and many local entities won’t assist as it’s considered “legal advice,” so I may need to seek more professional help, but starting in this fantastic community ☺️

Hello!! Curious whether anyone can help?! I have a 100% mobile PT (wound) practice. I take insurance. I have a patient that will drive 3 hours for treatment, probably once a month, maybe less. I have the option of renting a room at an existing PT facility near by. However she’s Medicaid, so I do not see this as working out financially. I’ve treated her wounds since 2016. I’m very interested in making this work. 

My questions are 1) Will there be an issue with billing place of service with Medicaid? 2) Anyone have luck with a PoS that is super inexpensive to assist a patient for an hour? 

Thanks in advance 😊

I have been subleasing a room in my clinic for about a year now with a massage therapist who has been excellent and very consistent. She works for another business. She was recently told in the past two days that the business she is working for is going under (even though she herself is extremely busy) and she will no longer be employed with them. Both her and I would like for her to stay in my clinic and we have discussed the option of her becoming my employee. Has anyone else done this and would you mind sharing the compensation they pay their massage therapist? I would want her to be paid only when she sees clients.

Hello,
I’m looking to see if anyone has advice on the best way to contact corporate contacts for outpatient therapy clinics? In other words, my current company provides a service to clinics and I would like to start connecting with therapy chains opposed to connecting with individual clinics. Thanks for your help!

Dear Uncaged Community - Are you a Neuro PT in the U.S.? If yes, I am a neurologic physical therapist and researcher hoping many of you would consider completing my IRB approved annonymous qualtrics survey:

[https://samuelmerritt.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_djtgBvo56bSr0Bo](https://samuelmerritt.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_djtgBvo56bSr0Bo) 

This research is approved by the Pacific University human subjects ethics committee and invites all physical therapists (PT) who identify as neurologic PTs with or without obtaining a neurologic clinical specialty by the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties who practice in the United States to participate in this data gathering process by completing a 10-15 min survey. 

We want to better understand the leadership practices of Neurologic Physical Therapists, as well as explore the subgroup of neuro PTs developing Neurologic Health Promotion and Wellness practices to define and describe this emerging landscape. Neurologic Physical Therapists bridging the gap between rehabilitation and wellness for people with neurologic disability are under researched and little is known about these innovative practices and the leaders supporting them. Thank you for your consideration! Please message me with any questions.

Imagine Airbnb for medical spaces?
 
Medical office is expensive; now imagine sharing medical space - AirBnB style! 

If you're looking for extra income, Hutano can help you lease your space to other practitioners. 

Overhead is one of the most significant expenses for any business, and it can quickly kill even the best ambition. The costs of renting medical office space, maintaining equipment, and paying utilities can quickly eat into profits. But Hutano Spaces offers a solution that can help to lower the cost of starting or expanding a practice. Hutano Spaces is a platform that makes it easy to list unused medical office space and rent it out by the hour, day, or month - just like AirBnB!

We provide an opportunity for providers looking for space to rent medical suites at a fraction of the cost of traditional leases. So if you're looking for a way to lower overhead costs or make extra cash from underutilized medical space, Hutano Spaces is worth checking out.

Please come tour our first Hutano Space at Dean Martin and Warm Springs in Las Vegas and see how Hutano can help you make the most of your space.

For more information, and list medical suites visit www.hutanospaces.com.

Not sure how accurate this is, and my 30 minute call with HealthNet wasn't very helpful... Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

If the patient is not the policyholder it doesn't carry over the "patient relate", if they are a child it doesn't carry over any of their information and it gives the following errors; Incomplete Patient Name, Invalid Patient Birthdate, Missing Patient Address, Missing Patient Gender Code.

If anyone knows how to fix this it would be greatly appreciated!

Hi everyone! 

I have a brick and mortar practice in Maine and have recently hired another therapist. We are considering offering the local community mobile outpatient care. I know several of you do this. 

Can anyone provide advice/recommendations for me? 

1. Did you add to your workman’s compensation insurance to cover the employee in other locations? 

2. What about auto insurance? She would be using her personal car to drive to appointments. 

3. Anything else you think I should know as we consider this service? 

Thanks everyone!

Hi everyone! Anyone in NYC wants to open up a wellness center together? I’m an OT with experience in general adult rehab and specializing in hands and upper extremity rehab. I am interesting in partnering up with someone and opening a wellness center or clinic together! If interested please comment and I’ll DM you. Thanks!

Hi! Does anyone use an easy online form to get consent prior to treatment? Looking for ideas as I’ll be treating some youth athletes without a parent present so maybe they could sign consent via email somehow? 
Thanks!

For those that have admins helping on the back end. Can you please tell me some of their duties and what their pay is? Also location. 

A little background: I have had an admin for a year now who has gradually taken on more duties and asks for more on a regular basis. I’m a sole provider but it has been a lot of the initial set up with insurance etc. I just updated her contract with list of duties that were fairly vague but covered what she is currently doing. I’m working through what policies and procedures should be in place but nothing is in stone yet. Where do people go and what does all of this look like in your world???
Thanks in advance!

Hey Ya'll!
Anyone have a digital side hustle and interested in a website editing project? I have a Pelvic Health PT colleague who is looking for someone to review her website and potentially revamp it! She's been in the biz for over 30 years and is looking for someone with fresh-eyes and a modern perspective 🙂
Let me know if you are interested! I would love to connect you!
