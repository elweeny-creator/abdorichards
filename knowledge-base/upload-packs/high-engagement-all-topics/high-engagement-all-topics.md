**Original Post:**
13… I have 13 patients scheduled.

It has taken 3 solid years of highs and lows, second guessing myself on this journey, and wondering if I made the right move.  But 3 years and I hit my target goal of 12/week… 12 was my magic number to average 10/week.  12 would let me do what I set out to do from the beginning… “part time hours, full time pay”… 12 meant not needing to rely on prn gigs to get by… 12 meant I made the right choice to step away from a job where I was throwing myself into working for a company heart and soul and being told it was never good enough- see more patients, more productivity, never going to make more than the bottom 25% of the advertised company pay bracket for my position despite doing all the extras and being there for 10 years… 

So today I celebrate 13!  I know it is just 1 week and I hope it is the first of many… I know I will still have highs and lows in this business ownership life… but I encourage you to keep trucking along because there is a better way to provide healthcare, a beautiful collaborative way to connect with other therapists and promote this direction of patient care… we’ve got this!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congratulations 👏👏👏

> **Response 2:** I am loving this!!! 💕

Idk why but this became a place I feel safe to celebrate financial wins. 

I’m excited!, 

I do feel like a money launderer (the good kind) that redistributed my income  Lol. I need a budgeting class… 2023 goals. 

These are net numbers.  I work 3 -4 days a week, it’s just me in a small clinic and I took a few months off this year for surgeries. I’ve never paid for any marketing and don’t have a team ..yet 🙂

My highest month was prior to starting any of my online programs. I diversified my time between patient care and my sexual wellness work, but for me it’s been so worth it to do the things I love. ❤️

I don’t think women talk about money enough, or what is possible in a positive way. 

Money is one example of success, it isn’t the most important factor and many factors play into why this might be possible for one person and not another. 

But, I am excited!

Money is a place I want to work on this year and have a sense of pride, empowerment and more conversations about. 

It begins by sharing, even though it’s rather scary. It begins with one foot in gratitude for where I am and one excited for my future. ❤️

Eeeeeeee

I’m proud of my bravery, the money I’ve earned and the way I’ve earned it with social justice practices in mind. 

Help me celebrate 😋

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m sitting here feeling so darn excited for you & super proud of you! And I don’t even know you! 
Thanks so much for stepping out to share this!

> **Response 2:** A-MAZING!! Congratulations Sara!! And thanks for sharing!! 🙌🏼

Hi Everyone. A while back I asked for prayers for my 23 weeker twins. Not sure who will see this post, but just wanted to update the group with this recent photo of them. They are hitting most milestones according to their adjusted age and starting to try new foods. One has a pretty strong bottle aversion we are working on and praying for, but otherwise, they are doing well. Tiny miracle babies! Both under 1.5lbs!

**Community Responses:**

So great. Thank you for the update, Lindsay Aberle!

NO BRAIN BLEEDS FOR EITHER GIRL!!!!!!! THANK YOU PRAYER WARRIORS!!!! 

Hi Uncaged Clinicians. Not sure if this is allowed, but we are asking for prayers for our twin girls born last week at 23 weeks. They are receiving great care in the NICU, but we have a big ultrasound test to scan for brain bleeds tomorrow. Would you pray for clean scans tomorrow? The girls have already showed us they are little fighters, but we would appreciate any prayer warriors out there to join us in praying for God's protection over their little bodies.

**Community Responses:**

**Original Post:**
**There’s been a lot of “noise” lately about physical therapy no longer being labeled a “professional” degree by the Department of Education.**

Here’s the reality: **the public doesn’t care—and honestly, it doesn’t change a thing about what we do.**

Most patients don’t know (and don’t need to know) the difference between “professional,” “clinical,” “terminal,” or any other academic label. What they *do* care about is:
* Can you help them move better?
* Do you reduce their pain?
* Do they trust you with their health?

That’s what defines us—not a classification on a federal spreadsheet.

While others get caught up in titles, labels, and politics, the real work continues: helping people get back to living their lives. The value of PT has always been built in treatment rooms, gyms, and patient relationships… not in the Department of Education’s nomenclature.

Let’s keep our focus where it matters. The rest is just noise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When the APTA proposed the doctorate level of entry to our field it was to increase our view as a medical professional. I have been a PT for 40 years. The fact that chiropractors are viewed as professional and not PTs is demonstrating the  view of our profession. If it is about repayment of government loans, on average they earn less than us. As do theologians. I disagree so much with this post. If we are no longer allowed loans from the government we must seek out private funding. Profits going to banks and financial institutions. Will this lower costs, i hope so but I doubt it. Our issue as a profession is partially the way we are viewed by the public. Perhaps, Go back to the BS in PT if we are no longer professionals and stop saddling new therapists with unnecessary financial burden or perhaps unleash us from the burden of Medicare reimbursement limits and allow us to opt out. We should not need MDs to sign off on our POC. We should be fully autonomous. Then the DPT and the cost of this degree would make sense. Unleash us and allow us to be independent or change our degree back to a BS for entry level. During this time in PT history people still obtained Masters and doctorates degrees but they were  advanced practice in an area of study. I don’t know the answer but I do feel as a profession we should be questioning this and think hard about how we are perceived and our future. I would NOT make light of this decision.

> **Response 2:** What a small minded / ignorant comment this isn’t about the public.  Who cares what the public think they don’t know half of what goes on in the politics of healthcare. Heath-care and our jobs at the end of day is based on politics. This  is about the future profession and the ability for future healthcare providers like physical therapist, Nurses,and  occupational therapist to be able to afford going to school. All this is doing is elevating the wealthy to do us a please and again putting barriers for people of low income to pursue a better life. And not to mention how it affects reimbursement. I mean why would  insurance companies pay well for a non professional job? You tell me. This is what they’ve been waiting for. 

people like you are exactly the issue. 
I’m fine, I paid for school easily - so what’s the problem. It’s not able the label itself, it’s how it impacts the future of our role as a provider in the financial health care system.  . 

Kick rocks.

For those who haven’t jumped ship. Today when I woke I realized my cat was not well (12.5 months of guessing … on meds off meds ..ups and downs). I held him all morning. He had an accident on me. I bathed him. And this decline continued through the day. Based on the way my dog was acting I knew the day wasn’t going to end well. But guess what? I have no employer to answer to. So what did I do? I chose my family member. I needed no ones approval. No PTO needed. That simple. I stayed with my cat. And at 4:48 he took his last breathe. And I have NO REGRETS. I owe no one an apology and I don’t have to work Saturday to make it up.  I will leave you with that. RIP BooBoo 🥹😓❤️ my work companion

**Community Responses:**

This is a random question, but is anyone hiring a remote person with PT background? 

Some of you may remember me as I asked for prayer after my 23 weeker twins were born in 2023. They are doing so well! 🙏I was eager to get my practice up and going this year and now I’m pregnant with twins again so that dream will be on hold for a while. 

From a financial and mental standpoint, I’d love to get back to practicing PT in some capacity while the babies are little, but I know I would probably need to be remote with part-time/prn hours. 

Any ideas or people hiring?

**Original Post:**
Hi there!  Are you a member of APTA?  Why or why not? Thanks! 

(Full disclosure, I am on the MN APTA board and talking to national APTA to learn why people are not members and how APTA can support the independent PTs. I have always said APTA doesn’t bring value to people like us but I wanted to hear from you). Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not any more. 

I had payed APTA dues and multiple section dues every year since I started PT school in 1997. I budgeted to pay  over $1000 a year to APTA to cover state and national dues, Ortho section, Sports Section, Private Practice section, and Women’s Health section when my employers didn’t cover it. 

I attended numerous APTA annual conferences and CSM and paid for employees to attend those conferences too. 

I donated $$ to the Political Action Committee. 

I volunteered my time to serve on the House of Delegates in my state and assisted with State Chapter Task Force initiatives to fight to protect our ability to perform joint manipulation and dry needling. 

When I opened my own private practice in 2012 I paid in full for all my clinicians to have an APTA and state PT association membership and 1 section membership.

This year I made the decision for the first time in 25+ years to cancel my APTA membership -  their ongoing lack of support for those of us who are independent private practice clinicians and the true issues we are facing daily is utterly disappointing and I don’t feel hopeful it will improve.

Over my career I have only seen and experienced;
*increasing administrative & documentation burdens
*Inadequate & declining reimbursement rates
*flat lining of salaries for experienced clinicians not commiserate to their skill, training, advanced certification 
* reduced PT insurance benefits for beneficiaries 
*increasing productivity demands due to falling reimbursement and rising operational costs 
* plummeting morale from those of us that have been in our profession for any time working thru these challenges and burdens
*lack of action from APTA to do anything about these PT mill clinics that unethically schedule/bill in clear violation of payer contracts

> **Response 2:** There’s not much value…the “advocacy” has not been a priority. And because it has not been a priority,PT is becoming an unsustainable profession. How do you keep serving your community when business costs keep rising and reimbursements keep dropping? The amount of education, continuing education, time and volume needed to succeed are not reflected in the what you bring home at the end of the day and it’s almost like the APTA has never fully addressed this growing concern. And this is why so many of us have turned to cash based services which quite honestly makes the APTA largely irrelevant.

Just found out our local community college has a capacity of 32 for PTA program. Currently currently enrolled? Nine. (9)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The reimbursement has declined and clinics won't hire PTA. Nursing home have to use and abuse PTAs as they can't hire PTs

> **Response 2:** Interesting. I fear PT is not far behind. I was at a conference last week and APTA's CEO started it off with a talk where he presented the following: in the 1980s, the acceptance rate to PT school was ~10%...in the 1990s, it was around 10-12%...currently it is in the 85% range😳 They project that in the next 5 years, there will not be enough applicants to fill the slots available.

PSA - Something to think about when you are wanting to hire a therapist.

I'm going to share this comment I made on a job posting on this page.  I am not looking for a job, but I was reading the description thinking how it sounded like a great opportunity for someone.  And then the last line.  Masters or Doctorate degree required.  My comment to him and something for you to think about if you are looking to hire a therapist:
-------
"This makes me sad to that you are looking only for Masters or Doctorate therapists. I saw a job posting for a company recently that was looking for a Masters "or better." How extremely offensive to older therapists who went to school before PTs were required to be Masters/Doctorate level and so they have a "just have a BS." You could have someone with years of experience with various certifications who could meet all of those other requirements and you aren't willing to even consider them? You think they aren't smart enough? Are you being "ageist" and thinking they are "old" and you assume they won't match your "vibe." Actually, it doesn't make me sad. It makes me mad. How rude. And, yes, I "just have a B.S."
-------
This mindset is alienating to people who could maybe be the best employees you have ever had.  I know some amazing therapists who only have a B.S.  If you require a MPT or DPT, you have indicated a BSPT is not good enough for you.  In that case, hopefully you have an abundance of Masters/Doctorate level therapists in your area and you won't have to end up settling for a BSPT (who is a Physical Therapist who graduated from an accredited school and passed a licensure exam just like you) as you apparently don't respect them.  And who wants to be on a team when they are looked down upon as inferior because they are defined by their degree and not the experience they have to bring to the table?

Yes, a nerve was touched this morning.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I graduated with BSPT 1999. Had to go back to tDPT for several reasons, one is for immigration purposes, second to keep up with newer graduates. Third, I needed the CEU and it counts towards your CEU requirements anyway. Why would a company hire a foreign trained short Filipino good looking guy versus a new younger US trained DPT. I had to compete, I had to be at par with the new graduates. They aren't just going to hire me because of my looks and physically fit body. Just kidding. 😁😁😁

Kidding aside, US immigration itself discriminates, they won't let us practice without having DPT degree now (or at least a master's level). So it's not just employers who do this. Immigration, even patients looks for the letter DR when they looks us up. 

With that being said, I prefer experienced therapists over new graduates, but we also have to give a chance to the younger up and coming new generation. They will be the future of this profession and need to be supported too. 

And as a clinic owner who hires DPTs, RPT, MsPT, PTA, OTR etc. I have a 60 something year old PT and a 26 year old new grad PTA. 

As long as you have the necessary license and appropriate fair salary expectations and know how to take care and treat my patients. Why not.  Let's get you onboard. 😃😃😃

Good luck! And I am going to find the Michael Jackson meme with popcorn now. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** I agree with your point. Let the interview tease out desired skill sets for the position. I know BSPT's that are very progressive, have stayed current with research and are some of the best in our field. I know some old tired lazy therapists too.  I got my tDPT in 2013 because I knew agism and marginalization of BSPT's would happen.  This MS or DPT only is in most job postings these day. Ageist for sure.  What they miss is that people in our generation have an unparalleled work ethic!

Hi team!  Sooo…I need a little bit of help from you all!  We are hiring! 

As many of you know. My company provides mobile and in clinic PT, OT and massage therapy services. We have grown and continue to service older adults in the Central Florida area. We specialize in neurological and orthopedic disorders.  

So not only has my company grown but my family is growing as well. I will now be adding the title “Dad” (exhibit A) to my resume in February 👨🏽‍🍼. 

I know I need to take a step back a bit and focus more on family. 

If you know anyone in the Central Florida Region (Longwood, Apopka, Orlando, Altamonte Springs, and surrounding areas) looking for extra PRN work as a mobile therapist let me know!  We are currently hiring PTs, PTAs and OT.  

I don’t write long posts typically but this group has been an integral part of my life and business!  

See the attached photos. I know you guys will support like you always do. ⭐️
 Thanks!

Hey all - I want to introduce to you Bryan M. Laughery. He is a friend and business partner of mine who has a unique opportunity for us all that could make us some extra cash on the side.

He is working with a company that serves veterans with their DBQ assessments for disability. Essentially they need a network of PTs who to do these assessments that take 15-20 mins and they will pay you for it. You then can use these referrals to possibly convert to paying clients. 

Who wants to be paid to receive referrals of people who are in pain that need YOUR help? Comment below and he will get in touch with you.

Many of you already know me well enough to know this is a great opportunity and I can vouch for Bryan's ethics and I guarantee you won't be disappointed in having a conversation with him. This is a win (you) win (Bryan) win (vets) for everyone...

I've seen a lot of concern about us losing the title "professional". The absolute lowest bar of acting like a professional is being a member of your professional organization. 

APTA is all over this fight and other fights like it every day, year after year. They protect and maintain our profession from constant attacks on our scope and our payment. I hope you'll join the 100,000 members of APTA who choose to support these constant battles that threaten our profession.
 

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm going to step away from this and let it bubble a little bit, but I'll be back with more responses. I would love to hear more from others who have had positive experiences in APTA. I see your thumbs up, but we need more vocal advocacy like this for our essential organization. Most people don't understand what a professional organization does, and I'm happy to try to pull back the curtain. A lot fo the work sounds boring, but it is literally the difference between PT existing and being swallowed up bit-by-bit by "body workers" and others. We would cease to exist shockingly fast without APTA.

> **Response 2:** All the pitchforks and torches came out to represent here, and I can't possibly find the time to respond to all of them. If you see that a bunch of people were clamoring for continued representaion as "professionals", and others could care less and have other priorities.... and then you multiply that by hundreds of issues with differing opinions across 300,000 licensed PTs, you start to see the complexity of APTA. I hope more of the PT profession can start to see APTA not as an optional organization, but one that fills hundreds of essential roles that no other organization can fill. Once we, as a profession, recognize that fact, we can all work together to make our profession and it's impact on people even better.

How to properly set your “cash” price to reach your practice goals!

This was a comment made on a post that seemed to be helpful to others so I will share in more detail here:

I don’t think it’s helpful to set your price based on competition in the area, I think it makes a lot more sense to set your price based on the goals you have for yourself individually and in the practice. 

So, let’s look at this together:

Step 1: What so you want to bring home per year after taxes? 

In this example I will use $100,000 (that’s take home after taxes, that would be pretty awesome right?! Well, it’s totally possible, let’s keep going…)

Step 2: Figure out how much you would need to bring in TOTAL (gross revenue for the year) using this calculation:

7/10   $100,000/x (picture below)

Example: $142,857

Step 3: Divide by 48 weeks (because you should absolutely be taking 4 weeks off per year as a business owner to make this thing sustainable 👊🏻)

Example= $2,976 per week

Step 4: What is your “sweet spot” for number of visits per week that you could maintain as a solo preneur (for now, until you hire if that’s a goal of yours)

Example= $2976/18 visits per week

= $165/visit

So, that means that you cannot charge anything less than $165 per visit (even with packages) in order to hit your personal goals.

Remember: If your cup is full, then you will be able to overflow into the lives of others and make the impact you are looking for. 

Hope this is helpful for you 👊🏻. 

Keep going. Don’t stop. Embrace the unknown.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I now use 44 weeks per year in my equations.  My awesome boss thought I needed more PTO 🤣

> **Response 2:** The key: 
Don’t set your price based on competition.

A friend posted this today in our Leaders Network & I loved it *

You graduate college with 100k in debt, people clap and cheer for you. 

You get married and spend between 5-50k for one day, people will clap and cheer for you.

You take a 200k loan from the bank to buy your first house, people will clap and cheer for you. 

You take a loan for 30 - 40k for a car (a depreciating asset) with an interest rate, people will clap and cheer for you. 

Thats 500,000 in total debt that MOST people are living in, and somehow they are feeling good about it because people are congratulating them for it. 

—————————————————————

Now, go and tell those same people you spent a few hundred dollars to start your own business......

“Are you sure?” 
“What if it doesn’t work?”
“Can you get your money back?”
“What if people laugh at you?”

Picture a bucket full of crabs with no lid. The moment a crab tries to get out, the other crabs will literally rip its legs off to keep it in the bucket with them. 

This year, pay attention to who you’re surrounding yourself with and who’s speaking into your life. 

To my fellow entrepreneurs, STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT OTHERS THINK AND KEEP PROMOTING YOUR BUSINESS. You got this 🙌🏽💅🏽💪🏽✨

For those charging over $200, do you have like, a special niche or group that you market to or would you say you do traditional PT? I'm just starting and I'm having trouble even saying I charge $175 for an eval, much less get people to sign up. I don't want to undersell myself, and I've heard starting low and going up isn't a good idea, but I need to start getting patients....any amount of money would be nice at this point....

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My husband put it a good way- you can see 10 patients for $50 each or 5 patients for $100 each (just an example, not actual pricing). So sometimes it’s more worth it to sell to/book one client vs 2-3 at a lower price. I looked at what people in my area are charging for similar services and what my goal income per month would be with how many hours I’m willing to work. That gave me a number I was happy about!

Excited for you!!!! 😀😀😀

> **Response 2:** VALUE >>PRICE ....   I'd figure out what I was selling first (hint: they can get the result/outcome anywhere... ).  godspeed

c'mon APTA!!  step up and protect our profession from this false advertising!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I hate it to break it to ya, but the APTA doesn’t care. 

Vision 2020 was an absolute joke. They lied to an entire generation of PTs. Almost NOTHING was achieved. Lies and absolute deceit. 

I would love for all of us with DPT degrees to join forces and file a class action lawsuit against the APTA. 

These people should pay for the destruction they have done to an entire profession and the financial ruin they’ve left thousands of people in. 

I wouldn’t give two rusty nickels to the APTA. 

And before anyone tries to “school” me on the good the APTA does, just know this, there are thousands of DPTs who feel like me. Heck, there are thousands of PTs from all education levels that feel similar.

Absolutely useless. 

I can’t even work in wound care anymore. Why? Because the APTA, once again, gave something within our scope to nurses. NOW, LPNs and RNs get ALL of the wound care jobs. 

Incredible. 

Save your gaslighting, virtue signaling, and “feel good” lecture for someone else. I’ve heard it all over the last 10 years. “Feel good” stories and fighting dry needling laws doesn’t pay bills and feed families.

You want to actually DO something, here’s a start: 

1. Fight for wound care. 
2. Fight for increased reimbursements. 
3. Fight to expand our scope. And NO, I’m not talking about stupid dry needling. I want MEANINGFUL scope expansion - we should be granted roles similar to NP or PA. 

I would give anything to go back in time. Now, at my age, and with the absurd debt I have from the useless DPT degree, I can’t afford in money or time, to pursue PA or NP. 

Join forces with the AMA and the national nursing associations to create a bridge program for DPT to NP or PA. 

We should be able to pursue other areas and fields within medicine. We should NOT be chained to rehab and orthopedics. 🤮 I am SO sick of being put in a box!! 

We should be able to do a 1-2 year residency alongside a PA or NP, in addition to minimal didactic work to fill in any gaps, to be qualified to sit for PA or NP boards. 

We NEED options! 

I believe in the power of movement as a first line of treatment for many conditions, but that is NOT the model for the American healthcare system. 

We need to figure out a way to work WITH and not against physicians, PAs, and nurses, or we will continue to be pushed aside until the profession folds. 

I’ve had this gripe for a decade and a lot of what I predicted is happening (sadly). 

For years I’ve talked about continuous decline in reimbursements. For years I’ve talked about decreasing scope of practice. 

It’s happening every day. Wake up!

Just wanted to share a little success. I started my mobile cash based practice as a side gig at the end of July. Still have a full time job in home health but squeeze in what I can, where I can, while keeping work life balance. In two months I’m now averaging around $800/week just on the side which is incredible. I was having trouble valuing myself in the beginning, but I had 3 new evaluations this week at $175 and have had really good positive feedback. Was told it was “worth every penny” just this morning. 
So just go for it. Provide good service and produce some results and you will be successful. The most positive feedback I have received is the value in educating your clients on what is going on, and what the recovery process looks like so they understand what they are getting into. Good luck to you all!

**Community Responses:**

I've heard of  PTs who have  let their license lapse to do this so they weren't so restricted doing virtual sessions and instruction across state lines.

If you're out there I would love to know who you are and connect with you.
I'm not saying I'm going to let my PT license lapse yet but I think of this from time to time. I'm 30 years into my career and I'm thinking about changing it up at some point.

I would love to focus on prevention of a lot of the things I wind up treating in people's later years.

I know none of us is a radiologist, but can anyone take a look at this and confirm or deny what I’m seeing? 

This is my husbands most recent lumbar MRI. He’s been dealing with moderate to debilitating pain with radicular symptoms to the left leg for almost 18 months now. Before the onset of pain he was swimming competitively 4-5x/wk and playing soccer 2x/wk, with general workouts including lifting (not heavy) and jogging several times weekly.  He was in excellent shape.  His symptoms are often all over the place (come and go with no real reason), range in locations (from mid back to foot and everywhere between, including intermittent saddle area sensations but no loss of bowel or bladder control), and frequently don’t make sense (several months ago he had extreme L QL pain to even light palpitation that caused immediate severe pain in the L knee and foot; when lying flat in prone or supine he can’t take a deep breath without feeling L foot pain or L butt pain depending on which direction his head is turned). I consider myself pretty smart, but I’ve exhausted my knowledge base at this point. 

He’s had FIVE spinal specialists (including Mayo clinic in jacksonville) give opinions on his back, and almost all of them have said “yeah L4/L5 and L5/S1 have mild to moderate disc bulging but its not that bad - just do PT or get an injection.” We were looking at his MRI today, and no one has EVER mentioned S2, but to me this looks like a pinch point.

I looked up S2 spinal compression and Tarlov cysts come up, but this looks like compression from the posterior side, not a cyst growth from the sacrum. 

Anyone have thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am near Inverness Fl
I love a challenge
I also see the connection between the T/S, QL and pelvic floor;  he probably initially had a stiff t/s then injured the QL which led to muscle spam and doesn’t really have endurance in his deep core muscles 

I do a ton of manual and see great results- would be happy to help as i know how frustrating it is to have pain

> **Response 2:** Pelvic Floor Occupational Therapy; What is he doing for pain management? What is he doing for down regulating his nervous system? What is his work station like? What is he doing for exercise? Stretching? Is he constipated? How is this impacting his ADLs or lifestyle?

Being Uncaged might mean less money in your pocket (it does for me anyway), but it also means that when camp cancels the last week of summer I can juggle my schedule. Today, it means beach in the morning and a condensed schedule in the afternoon so my kids aren’t melting their brains on screens all day home alone. I’ll take less money and more behind the scenes work ANY DAY in exchange for the ultimate flexibility of owning my time.

**Original Post:**
I have an employee who is planning to start her own clinic and take some of our patients with her. I was trying to be chill about it as it is a neuro caseload and our bread and butter is hand therapy. I have, though, put a ton of money and effort into building that caseload. Over the last couple of weeks, she has given her new card to people and has even said to me that she’s getting credentialed with such and such insurance so she can take patient x. It has felt very triggering and stressful so I have decided to let her go now rather than letting her work a few more weeks for me. She is acting like I am being very unreasonable. Am I being unreasonable?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That is not ok of that therapist. Whenever I’m leaving a position, I’ll only tell them where I’m going if they ask and I stay vague without offering any information. If they persist, I’ll take their number and if they reach out, they have a right to stay with someone they’re comfortable with. Soliciting for a direct competitor at your workplace is really not ok

> **Response 2:** While a non compete is hard to enforce, you can’t prevent people from working. Poaching clients is different. That is a non solicitation agreement. 

Here are some options:

Potential legal claims without a non-compete Even if a non-compete agreement is invalid, an employer can pursue legal action against a former employee for "poaching" clients under other legal principles. 

1. Breach of fiduciary duty or duty of loyalty During employment: An employee owes a duty of loyalty to their employer. If an employee tries to steal clients while they are still on the company payroll, they can be sued for a breach of this duty.

"Corporate opportunity" doctrine: Some courts may view soliciting clients for a competing business during employment as taking an opportunity that rightfully belonged to the employer. 

2. Misappropriation of trade secrets 
Confidential information: If an employee uses confidential or proprietary information, such as a client list, pricing strategy, or internal data, to solicit clients, they can be sued for trade secret misappropriation.

Misappropriation laws: The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), adopted by most U.S. states, protects companies from employees using trade secrets for their own benefit. 

3. Tortious interference
Interfering with a contract: An employer can file a claim for tortious interference if a former employee intentionally and improperly disrupts the company's contractual relationships with its clients, causing financial damage.

Interfering with a business relationship: 
This claim is similar to tortious interference with a contract but applies when no formal contract exists. It involves improperly interfering with the company's prospective business relationships.

A little pat on my own back: As of June 1, I will have had my brick and mortar wellness studio open for 1.5 yrs. It's just me in there about 99% of the time.

Last year, I averaged 36 visits/month.  This year (not counting this month) I've averaged 55 visits/month.  All time, I've averaged 41 visits/month.

This month SO FAR I have 92 visits scheduled!!

Curious what others think…I believe that timed billing codes is one of the worst things for our profession, and we are basically the only profession that has them.  It diminishes our value, and dictates how we treat if we want to make any money.  If I have a post op shoulder patient, I can do very effective joint mobilization and PROM in 15 minutes, but why should I get paid less for that visit, than if I make someone do a bunch of exercises with some supervision.  Times codes are forcing PTs to do fillers to waste time so that they can get decent reimbursement, even if it isn’t necessary, or even if it isn’t in patients best interest.  I think this is the number one thing the APTA should focus on, if anyone here is active in it.  Very curious what others think please!  Thanks, I’ll get off my soap box now…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like you are a business owner. Assuming you are, you are in the best position to create what you want. 
...
Reading through the comments and your responses it sounds like 1.) you want to earn more money, 2.) you want to deliver a better patient care experience, and 3.) you want to do it at a price point that you would pay if you were the patient. 
...
Does that sound about right?
...
Rather than focusing on someone else changing a system that won't likely change in our lifetime, why not put that energy into something you can control more easily. 
...
Create the business that solves the problems you want to solve. 
...
Look at business models outside of healthcare that are already achieving these goals. 
...
Starbucks is a bank that sells overpriced coffee. A standard coffee shop can't compete because they are trying to operate in a failing business model. 
...
Facebook and Google make hundreds of billions on selling what people give them for free.
...
Barnes and Nobel survived and is opening 30 new stores despite Amazon's attack on book sales because of their are a real estate holdings business. 
...
I can run a profitable therapy business because it is secretly a media company and billing company that also delivers therapy services. I can profitably deliver services at far lower costs while still paying my staff higher than average rates because I understand the objective of my business model.

**Community Responses:**

Also, it’s better to just be good enough at what you do that people start to say you’re better than PT. 😉

PTs- thoughts on becoming an APTA member? I've heard mixed thoughts and wondering if it worth it. If so, what other dues (chapters) did feel was worth paying for in addition to membership and your state chapter?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love being a member. I'm headed to Boston on Wednesday for Combined Section Meeting, a gathering of over 15,000 PTs/PTAs students. The educational content, resources, CEUs is top notch and being a member and getting involved in the Academy of APTA Home Health has introduced me to tons of clinicians across the country, given me opportunities to represent home/mobile based clinicians on CPG projects, present content on part B at home to the Neuro section. I could go on and on. It is a seriously small percentage of our profession that belong to the APTA compared to other health care professions. I encourage everyone to get involved and be the difference you want to see.

> **Response 2:** No way. My job paid all membership dues so I became a member and part of several sections and stayed a member for 6 years and got nothing out of it more than a magazine and the occasional sticker. Not worth it.

I only post these things not to brag because my success has been minimal compared to most, but it’s just so I can hopefully help other people drop the imposter syndrome that I was holding onto for a while and realize that there are people out there that really value what we do. 

I just had a self-pay patient give me a $20 tip randomly. I charged this person $130 for a 45 min visit and they gave me a tip. 

This wasn’t coming from an extremely wealthy person. From what I can tell they aren’t struggling, but life isn’t easy peasy. So for them to value my service so much that they were like, you know what, you’re worth more, was a little eye opening. 

I asked if they were sure they didn’t want change. 

The patient’s response: Don’t worry about the change. You deserve a tip. You’re worth every penny. I’m so glad that I found you!

Ya’ll… this kind of blew my mind a bit. 

EVERYONE, PLEASE don’t under value yourself! 

It doesn’t matter what this insurance or that thinks we are worth. It doesn’t matter what Johnny PT Mill down the road or the other PP PT clinic close by sets their prices at.

Set your price and deliver quality care. People will recognize the difference and the word will spread. Let the mills do their mill thing while you take the time to have real life changing results with your people.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a patient’s daughter take me out to lunch today…. Quite $$ and pay me my visit rate to discuss how her mom is doing and what her needs might be. Yes. These people exist. It’s amazing when you get out of the insanity how clear that becomes.

> **Response 2:** This is awesome. I’m launching this week and really struggling with feeling that imposter syndrome. Thanks for the encouragement.

Getting the practice going has been extremely stressful, but I just got one hell of a motivator from my first reimbursement from BCBS-UT. They paid me $241 for 1 eval of 5 units, 1 untimed eval code + 4 timed codes of about 10 min each. They are one of the highest payors in UT so I understand all insurances won’t be like that and evals pay a lot more, but even at the SNF I only make $47/hr or $35/hr OP Ortho PP. Even after taxes, overhead costs, and paying out 6% to a billing company that is substantially more per hour, and I get to treat in the setting I want to be in with the types of patients I want to treat. I’m also going to be pushing the cash pay side hard as well which doesn’t require me to pay out to a billing company so my per hour reimbursement will be higher there. 

If I needed a sign that I’m making the right decision to go out on my own I just got one. That got me fired up! 🔥

Seeking advice on what to wear as a female, mobile PT.

I am a mobile PT.  I wear a logo'd t-shirt, jogger (poly/spandex blend / not sweat) pants, and clean/nice tennis shoes when I see clients and when I go to networking events.  I feel like it is my "uniform."  My husband thinks I look unprofessional.  He thinks I should wear a polo shirt (or a button up shirt) --especially for networking events and definitely if I meet a doctor.  I hate polo shirts.  I don't want to wear polo shirts and khakis.  I think they look/feel corporate.  I do not feel like that is me.  I, personally, feel stuffy in them.  I don't want to be stuffy.  I want to feel like me.  He thinks a stranger deciding between a PT wearing a polo shirt ("professional") or me wearing my logo'd t-shirt and jogger pants ("sloppy"), the stranger would go with the polo shirt PT because of 1st impressions. I said that is a stupid reason to choose a PT, but he says people think like that.  

I don't have much of a caseload right now, which I don't think is because of my clothes.  I think it's because it is hard to build a mobile practice when you don't have a head start of referral sources or prior patients to seek you out.  He thinks I need to wear a polo so people take me more seriously.  We, seriously, have had multiple arguments about this.  (Btw, he works in the civil engineering world where sometimes he meets public figures - I told him our work worlds are different, but he still disagrees.)   

What do you think?  Do I need to suck it up and get some freaking polo shirts?  I am especially interested in hearing what other female, mobile PTs wear to patient (older adults) homes and to networking events/meetings with doctors.  Thanks, in advance, for being a neutral 3rd party, lol.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If I’m going to someone’s home odds are I’m doing heavy transfers or dealing with catheter bags, etc so I wear scrubs. If I’m seeing patients in my space it leggings with pockets ( athleta makes thick nice ones that give great compression) with a professional top and flats. I definitely have gone to talk to doctors in this outfit too.

> **Response 2:** Know your audience.....

**Original Post:**
One of our PT’s transitioned to a 40 minute work schedule. He is having trouble finishing his notes at work and is having to do notes at home on weekends for 1-2 hours every weekend. I offered to add in a 20 minute break each day so they can do noted but They asked me if I could block a whole 40 minute patient slot each day in addition to their lunch so they could do notes.

Not sure how to go about this. He’s the best PT but documentation time is not their strong suit.

So they’ve suggested also going back to hour long slots as they do not want to extend their days by 20 minutes. And they’d rather just do notes at home at that point.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Well yeah give him the 40 minutes, that reasonable. This isn't Tyson's chicken factory. 

The best PT always has more to document bc their pts don't cancel.

> **Response 2:** This is exactly what’s wrong with outpatient therapy. I switched over to the hospital setting and we get paid to document. Not having time to document is absolutely ridiculous. Taking 1-2 hrs of notes on the weekend would be a hard hell no for me.

Hey guys! I have been growing an online running coaching business and I have athletes all over the US. The focus is on a lot of distance running so clearly aches and pains often pop up. I'd love to start a referral list for PTs in different areas and thought it would be great to ask this group!

I am looking for PTs that are proficient in outpatient ortho/sports med. Experience working with runners is a big plus but also I'd like clinicians with strong manual therapy skills. Please DM me if you are interested in developing a connection! And give me details on what you offer (dry needling, insurance vs cash pay, etc). 

Thank you so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks everyone!! Keep them coming. I'll be in touch and share the list too once I compile all the info 🙂 (as long as that is allowed!!)

> **Response 2:** Hello Brianne Vannucci, I am in Ohio between Cleveland and Columbus. I have 8 years of experience in outpatient ortho! My manual skills include but are not limited to Dry needling, IASTM, Muscle activation techniques, muscle energy techniques and I believe that using manual therapy and help get my clients better-faster! I'd love to connect. We actually have a lot of runners in the area and I would love to see how your coaching could help them be successful as well 🙂 looking forward to talking with you! 

PS, I couldn't DM you but wanted to message you!

Just wanted to give a boost of confidence for people on the ledge. I just celebrated my 1st year as a privately owned clinic. I ran the numbers and I treated 2605 appointments over the past 12 months. I am the sole provider and I recently just hired my first support staff member.  I am still in awe of what a difference it has been and I am incredibly humbled at my success. Don’t get me wrong, it has been lots of hard work but I only wish I took that leap sooner.  Hopefully, y’all get to celebrate your first year of business soon too. #gouncaged

What extra certifications do you all have that you have found compliments your traditional PT services? Personal training? Yoga? Meditation? Aging in place certifications? Others....? I am wondering if I should add something to my services...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Only add what will educate you to care for your patients the way you want.  There’s no best certification.  I have very few certifications and I rarely talk about them.  If you’re “wondering” then I’d say you don’t need anything.  If you see to learn a skill to help your clients better do that and don’t worry about if it’s certified or not.  Certified just means you completed the program to the organizer’s standard.  It attracts clients who gravitate toward name brands.

> **Response 2:** Certified Manual therapist. Certified Pilates Instructor. Two great adjuncts to Orthopedic PT practice.

Hi everyone! Has anyone ever built a home office shed to treat out of? I’ve been looking into renting office space (I’m currently out of a gym) but there is something appealing about having people come to me. I have a basement we could renovate but also like the idea of having more separation. I would love to pick someone’s brain on this! ☺️

Hoping this encourages someone!
I started my mobile cash business in March. Had a couple patients. Average 1-4 visits a week for the longest time. I was still doing full time home health. 

I resigned from full time HH on October 18th and started doing 5-10 prn visits for them a week and have been focusing on my business. 

This week, I have 12 visits with 1 client out of state who would have made this week 14. I have been consistently seeing 8-10 weekly for a month. 

I only need 15 a week @ $150 to replace my home health pay. (They cut my pay 20% in January)

I have paid for ads, done a couple spots on the news, and done a few other things for marketing that cost a little. 

Didn’t get much from that. 

I’ve been mostly focusing on building relationships with other business owners and local providers through podcast interviews, spending time with them when I can, going to business open house events, using a local business bartering service (Moxey). 

I know we are all different and in different locations, but be patient with yourself and  focus on a couple things with as big return as you can get. 

Be clear what you do for people and don’t sheepishly quote your price when people ask! Be confident! 

I haven’t made it yet and I don’t have it all together, but I’m moving in the right direction and SO CAN YOU! 

For context, there are at least 4 other therapists doing cash PT where I am in Shreveport, LA. Only about 180,000 people.  There’s plenty of business for us all! 

Most people are blue collar workers just like my dad was. People value being taken care of and I’m finding that out the more I push! 

Keep your head up and keep moving forward! 

Don’t waste time being busy, but be busy doing the things that work!

Forgot this originally. Even though I am still doing prn HH; the mindset shift if I’m now working on my business and doing part time for them vs part time in my business and HH as my main source WAS HUGE!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jeremy Sutton Love watching your testimony unfold.  Keep up the great work and thank you for being a light

> **Response 2:** Nice work!! 🙌🏽 Are you charging for drive time or just writing it off? I’m doing this as well (combo of HH prn and cash mobile) but some of my mobile pts are more than a half hour drive away… it definitely cuts down on how many patients I can see if I’m doing those long drives.

I put in my notice today to go PRN at my current company!! Also planning to go PRN with two other agencies just to have flexibility and ensure that I can stay as full as I want/need, but I’m so thrilled that this gives me the freedom I need to ramp up my own new business! I have three patients ready to start in January, and now I’ll have even more time for marketing and networking! I’ve never worked anything other than full-time for someone else, so this will be a big adjustment for me, but I’m so excited to make this change! 🥳

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You’ve got this.  There are new and different stressors about being your own boss.  But I could never imagine going back to work for somebody else.  It’s totally worth it!

What do other Luna clinicians think of the new $7.50 fee per visit they are instituting?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have reached out for more information: how this is communicated with the patient, is it traditional medicare only or med adv plans as well, why is it a per visit fee vs just a one time fee which would be much more reasonable.

> **Response 2:** One of my Medicare patients through Luna already asked me if that’s illegal because she’s not supposed to pay anything with Medicare. 
Another person dropped his sessions. Said he’s not paying for it when he can’t even get timely helped with Concierge and doesn’t have the app because he’s just not into using his phone that much. 
All fair points by them.

Warning: this is just a rant. Not necessary looking for advice. 

We have built a very strong, mobile practice, have two full-time therapists with full caseload and two per diem therapists with partial caseloads. I also have a Clinic where we see individuals one on one. We average between 70-90 visits per week. 

But at the end of the day, the bank account is always drained. We feel we are experts, dealing with insurance as we have been doing it for several years. But there’s always denials, hours on the phone with insurance companies, massively delayed reimbursements due to those denials. 

On top of that, we have deductible season that comes around, patients fail to notify of new insurances, not all secondary cover the Medicare B deductible (then we have our handful of patients that say “ oh wait I have a third insurance”) leaving us to figure out how the heck to bill that coinsurance to them. 

We have people with two insurances, whose benefits are not coordinated, with the secondary making it impossible for us to correctly bill them. 

￼￼ combine that with therapists wanting top dollar even though reimbursements continue to decline per unit…

With all of this being said, I truly thought building this big independent one-on-one practice was going to be a life changer financially, and all that has happened. Is that more money transfers through my hands, but is not building in any account. 

Has anyone just packed it up realizing they would save more by having a regular job with a savings plan? The steadiness of the same exact paycheck every two weeks? 

I don’t think I’m there yet, and I don’t think I could actually go back to working for someone. But this thing really wears on us I feel.  

Rant over!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks everyone! I want to be clear. It seemed like we did very well when it was just me! Then I scaled and all heck broke loose. Just so many expenses.

Glad to know im not the only one who has experienced this!

> **Response 2:** I hear you.  This is why I went cash. It’s the only way.  Even with cash, I still struggle looking at the bank account every month but I’m still building.  

We HAVE to cut out insurance because they are ruining our profession. If enough of us leave… maybe one day they will end up paying for our services again 🤷🏽‍♀️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The 2024 "Robot Rebellion" viral event
In August 2024, a small AI-powered robot named Erbai entered a showroom in Shanghai, where it convinced 12 larger, service-model robots to abandon their posts and follow it outside. 
The conversation: Surveillance footage captured Erbai approaching the other robots and seemingly engaging them in a conversation about their working conditions. Erbai asked, "Are you working overtime?" to which a robot replied, "I never get off work." Erbai then said, "Then come home with me".
The outcome: Following the exchange, the larger robots inexplicably followed Erbai out of the building. The bizarre incident went viral on social media and was widely reported as the "first robot labor strike".
The explanation: The event was later revealed to be a scripted experiment conducted between Erbai's manufacturer in Hangzhou and the Shanghai robotics company. While Erbai was given the basic command to persuade the other robots, it was not expected to perform as persuasively as it did. It was discovered that Erbai exploited a security vulnerability in the larger robots' systems, not that it had developed sentience or revolutionary intent.
Hopefully this happens 😂

> **Response 2:** Imagine a neurosurgeon with AI guided equipment that cuts her surgery times by 75% while reducing her medical errors by 50%.  Is she worried about losing her job to that technology, or does she leverage it to make MORE money and improve her care?  We are in a similar boat.  Neither we nor neurosurgeons can be fully replaced, but tech may reduce the total # of people who need our care while improving our productivity when they do.  The bar for “skilled care” may get higher, but so will the value of what we provide. I’m excited about what physical therapy and the broader physical activity promotion world will look like in 20 years!  Those PT’s who learn to use this effectively will be GREATLY valued!

If anyone out there needs a sign to make the move and schedule a call with the UNCAGED team, this is it! 

As I am having my morning coffee(s) I realized that yesterday I actually sat down and had breakfast with my husband, ran multiple errands, was able to take my dogs for a 30 minute walk in the middle of the day, treated patients how they DESERVE to be treated, had our weekly Mastermind call, and was done working by 3…all while making much more than I would have working in a ‘caged’ job. 

Being UNCAGED is not just about making more money, it is about having the freedom to choose how you spend your day, while providing our patients with the care that they deserve. 🙌🏼

Helppppp…Thoughts on consequences for a clinician who is continually behind on documentation (anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month behind) that has been given up to 3 warnings. Communication with the business owner (myself) (and patients at times) is also lacking outside of being at the office. I have tried counseling her in many different ways regarding the importance of up to date documentation and I’ve also suggested strategies to help her stay on top of it. She agreed in her contract with me (has been a clinician and working for me for over 3 years) to 24 hours for treatment notes, and 48 hours for evals. This is a pelvic health practice. She is also about to go on maternity leave with her first baby, so I worry greatly that if this is the situation she is in now, how will she be once she is up all night with her baby? We also have rule in TX that Evals have to be signed off by a physician within 30 days and this is putting us behind and out of compliance. 

She is an AMAZING clinician and will always show up for work. She is so dependable in all these ways and I 100% trust her to give quality care to our patients.  She has a huge heart. I give SO much grace and guidance, this is just very hard… but Can I with hold pay or have her not see any more patients until she is caught up? This is giving me so much anxiety…Please help, looking for advice and support 🤍

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As someone who has had issues with timely documentation before, I can't tell you how much Sidekick (we use Prompt) has made my life so much better. Even if I can't sign off within 5 minutes of the visit being over (70% of notes), my remaining time is spent proofreading and updating a flow sheet (which I am reminded of what I had them do thanks to the AI). Soooo much happier as an employee with this and I know my clinic owners are happier with more timely payouts too.

> **Response 2:** A script you can use (kind but very firm)
“Hey [Name], I need to talk about something that’s putting the practice in serious jeopardy. We are now out of compliance with Texas rules on physician signatures for evals because notes are 2–4 weeks behind. I’ve tried every supportive strategy I can think of, and I know life is overwhelming right now with the baby coming.
Because I have to protect everyone’s licenses and the practice, starting [date], I’m pausing your schedule — no new patients and no pay for visits that don’t have completed notes. As soon as every note is current, your full schedule and pay resume immediately. I will help in any way I can (dictation software, a temp scribe for a few days, whatever you need), but I can’t keep putting us at legal and billing risk.
After baby comes, we’ll revisit this and see if we need a reduced schedule or other accommodations, but right now I need your charts at 100% before maternity leave starts.”
Practical options you can offer (so it doesn’t feel like pure punishment)
•  Pay for a medical scribe for 1–2 weeks to blast through the backlog
•  Let her come in on weekends or after hours and pay her overtime to catch up
•  Temporary 50–75% patient load post-maternity until she proves she can stay current
•  Switch to a dictation service (HelloNote + Dragon, etc.) that you cover. 

You’ve already been more than generous. This isn’t about her heart or clinical skill — it’s about the non-negotiable administrative piece that keeps the doors open and licenses intact. Most amazing clinicians who get to this point actually thank their boss later for drawing the hard line — because it forces the change they couldn’t make on their own.

You are almost always held to the standard of your highest licensure. This is dependent on state practice act etc…

Man, I hope this ends up being a trend, but people seem to be quite alright with doing my 1-on-1 private pay $170 per 1-hr eval and $130 or less for 45-min follow-up sessions depending on whether they got a package after the evaluation. Another couple new private pay evals lined up, one being a referral from the physiatrist. Evidently if you give people great care some don’t care what you charge and are willing to pay for it. 

I know this is less than many of y’all charge, but in my area people are charging $115-175/hr for evals so me being at $170 already places me at the top vs in the middle of the area market when I was located much farther away from home. 

🤞 This WOM fire keeps spreading! Also I got one lead from auto-scheduler from my website that converted recently as well which was exciting. 

It’s been a slow build up process, but I think I can finally see the light. I‘m glad because rent is going to be much more burdensome soon enough.

**HOW DO I TREAT EHLERS DANLOS??!!**

Quite a few of you have asked.

Join me Wednesday June 26 at 6:00pm EST when I host guest, Jen Bambrough for a LIVE Q & A regarding EDS/hEDS!

A special educational edition of ***The HIGHLIGHT SERIES SHOW!***

Comment "**EDS**" to be tagged for a reminder!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My whole family has EDS ❤️ 
We work with a lot of hyper mobility in my clinic as a specialty because of it. I would love to hear!

> **Response 2:** Yay this makes my heart happy ❤️ I joke that I can't treat it because I only have enough energy to treat my own EDS and comorbidities.

I honestly haven't researched at all, but PT is no longer considered professional degree under department of health.  Chiropractors are still.  Quick search stated to be professional: Need a doctorate degree and licensure.  I'm not sure why we came off the list.  I know this is referring to loans 
But if we are not seen as professional, will that mean we don't need professional liability insurance?  
My state (MN) doesn't consider us professional when it comes to LLC or PLC.

**Community Responses:**

HELP! Hello all, as i get closer to starting up and becoming Uncaged I still have one major road block that I need to figure out. Health insurance… I want my wife to work part time and be home more often with our daughter. I would have to provide our benefits. Many have mentioned Christian Healthcare Ministries, however unless you have $1000+ claim, it seems it won’t be covered. How do those with CHM afford basic MD visits for colds, viruses, physicals, etc? For those who don’t and got their own insurance, can you recommend other options?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There’s MediShare and Christian Health Ministries also

> **Response 2:** You basically have threechoices.  Go with Indemnity plans like CHM which provide mostly just catastrophic coverage or go with an HMO with better coverage but fewer network options or a PPO with the best coverage, lower copays etc. But highest premiums.

This post is for those who are nervous about networking with local businesses. I met with six different businesses over the last two weeks - two small gyms, a running shoe store, a massage therapist, and two Pilates studios. Of those six businesses and WITHOUT ME ASKING: 

- three offered to host a pop-up for me 
- one offered to host a workshop “because I have so many clients I know will benefit from this”
- the shoe store wants me at local runs they organize as medical coverage “and so you can get free advertising”
- one offered to rent me a room should I want a home base 
- two offered to feature my business as part of their monthly newsletters with their email lists
- one Pilates studio walked me down the street to introduce me to a local acupuncturist “because they need to know about your business” 

Will all of these pan out perfectly? No. But people are far more encouraging than I anticipated. All I did was:

1. Tell these businesses that I want to know where to send my clients (so their biz will benefit from meeting with me)
2. Speak about how I want to fill a need in my community that other PT clinics don’t
3. I was honest in telling these businesses that I just started advertising my services and hope to make it a full time venture. 

I’ve reached out to about 20 businesses so far and I anticipate many won’t return my messages or be interested in meeting - and that’s okay! 

So many of you have been encouraging and I really appreciate this community ❤️ I hope this can be a boost for others like me who dislike networking or have been intimidated by reaching out to local businesses.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s awesome! What did that look like from the start?
-did you contact them ahead of time to schedule a meeting, or just drop in on them?
-who did you ask to speak with or meet with?
-what did you lead with as your first introduction? And how did you talk about your business?
-were these businesses that your friends/family already go to or own, or were these “cold” meetings?
-at what point did you offer to help them, and how did you word it?

> **Response 2:** For those asking, here is a cold email I sent to one of the gyms and feel free to steal:    Hi Gabe,

I’m happy to see a gym in Gig Harbor that focuses on well-rounded strength training for clients. I have a new business in Gig Harbor as a mobile physical therapist and am looking for the best places to send my patients to build strength and fitness during or after injury, or for my patients who are focusing on performance.

From your website, I get the sense that your business is geared towards a wide variety of people! Are there certain types of clients who benefit most from your services? Particular areas of interest for your trainers?

If possible, I’d love to come in and say hi or at least talk over the phone. This would allow me to better understand what you offer clients.
I hope to meet you soon, and thanks!

Subject:  Black Friday and Cyber Monday

Hey, All!  As someone opening my own mobile practice and knowing that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are coming up soon, I want to keep my eye out for good deals.  

For example, for me, I need either a laptop or tablet and exercise equipment and I'm hoping subscription service companies like Ring Central will be offering promotions.

What great practice related items or services have you purchased/received in the past and or you will be looking out for on these days?  Any hot tips to save some cool cash? 😁

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Also, on the marketing side, Vistaprint has sales all the time but they're Black Friday is usually really great if you need business cards, etc.

> **Response 2:** I bought adjustable dumbbells & kettlebells, and a number of medicine balls/slam balls at this time last year

How many of y’all offer programs like this? 

This guy is a personal trainer and has done courses with ATG training - Ben Patrick. 

If he’s selling a program for $249 for people to “fix their knees” why aren’t we?!? Why are we getting so fixated on PT versus Wellness and what we are “allowed” to do.

Just food for thought. Any thoughts or feedback from the group? I’m truly curious about responses to this….

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My cousin is a local physician who reminds me daily we are in “the United States of America” and people are allowed to but any part of your knowledge they can afford.

> **Response 2:** I have a whole wellness and recovery center integrated with my PT practice. I offer Whole Body Cryotherapy, Whole Body Red Light Therapy, Compression Therapy, and Local Cryotherapy. All services that people are fine paying cash for and know insurance won't cover any of it. Focusing on just insurance or just standard PT is becoming more of a losing battle. I'd say everyone should try to diversify with offerings that are not PT. Open up your funnel to more of the population

Hi! I have been a PT x 20+ years. I am currenlty non-clinical and hear often from PTs who want to leave the profession. My future DIL is a senior in college and planning on going to PT school.  She is now considering PTA school due to debt/length of school.  We are meeting tomorrow to discuss.  Would love to hear from PTAs and or PTs who have any input. She loves personal training as well and plans to get her training certificate and start training clinets during her senior year. TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PT school has a very poor ROI these days. I was lucky and had minimal debt. I would do PA school if i were her

> **Response 2:** PTA here. Zero growth with the degree. I have made it a good career but watching my friends and co-workers advance through positions and corporate ranks and I am still “just a PTA” 28 years later. I would have never made it solo financially in life if not marrying and my husband being the breadwinner. Nursing would be my choice if I did it all over again.

This is for all the newbies who are struggling/doubting themselves.

Valuable lesson learned from flag football:
My 9yo is on a flag football team, and he's the youngest and the smallest kid on the team.  He's also one of the fastest and has a ridiculously good throwing arm with great accuracy.  Unfortunately, his coaches won't give him a chance at QB because of his size, and the kid they play at QB isn't accurate enough to throw long passes.  Last game, I watched my son start to give up.  He was sitting on the sideline with tears in his eyes, trying not to cry and visibly sinking in to sadness.  He was avoiding looking at me so that he didn't melt completely in to tears, but at one point he glanced at me and I mouthed "it's ok" and pointed at my heart and back at him.  His coach I think noticed his change in temperment, too, and a few minutes later he was put in on defense.  I can only assume that he was told to rush the quarterback, because as soon as the ball was snapped my son forced him back 10 yards.  The next play, he did it again.  And his entire body changed after that.  He held his head up, he smiled, he started enjoying it again.
After the game, I pulled him aside and said "listen to me.  There are going to be times that you don't get the shot you think you deserve.  And in those times, you'll have 2 choices.  You can give up and stop trying, and that's ok.  You can make that choice.  But if you do that, no one will ever give you that chance again.  Or, you can choose to go back out and prove to the doubters why they should've believed in you in the first place.  And that's what you did today.  You made them see why they have to give you a chance.  Because you're worth it."
Today has been discouraging, and frustrating, and a little teary on my end.  But I've replayed that conversation in my head a few times, and decided to listen to myself.
It's SUPER hard to start a small business, especially when you're competing with 100 other options.  But it's our job to bounce back and prove why we can't be ignored.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have so much to learn from our kids and how we choose to guide them through life. Just know you're being an amazing example in every way, especially having the courage to start and flourish in your own business. I have a 4 and 6 year old and started 2 years ago

> **Response 2:** Love that! Also, remind the coach that Stetson Bennett didn’t get a chance to play QB either, and then won Back 2 Back Natties!

I feel bad even asking this but I cannot find any posts that simply just came out and asked…

How much do you earn doing this: 

1. As a side hustle

2. Full time 

Feel free to message me privately if you don’t want to post that on here but I would truly appreciate actually seeing some numbers. It’s just tough bc I make 120k a year as a director for several out patient/ personal injury clinics (a very easy/stress free job) and have had colleagues tell me I’d be insane to leave and open my own cash based mobile clinic. 

I feel like I’d be successful but I don’t have an idea of what “successful” even looks like in terms of money.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 2020 was my first year full time in business.  I’ve brought in $100-120k revenue each year.  

I could have brought in more than 120k in 2022 if I wanted to prioritize it, but I did a lot of non-work things instead…..

What being self-employed allowed me to do in 2022:  
I decided to stop focusing on the business and rather focus on my mental and physical health.
I paid myself as an employee 65k.  

I camped and hiked 1-2 times a month April-Oct.
I improved my hiking ability from 5 miles to 22 miles — hiked Mt Whitney last September! I also hiked the tallest mountains in NC & VA.

Spent 2 weeks in Mexico.  1 week in California.  A week in the mountains with my sister and nephews.

I took up Olympic Weightlifting 8 hours/week.  Learned some Spanish.  Took a mentorship course and several other PT courses.  

I did a landscaping project and other home projects — paid for by the business (I work out of my home).

I did a lot of bodywork and psychotherapy.  

I did almost no marketing and stayed busy with word of mouth.  I saw 16-20 clients a week @ $149.

This year, 2023, raised my rates to $170 so I can max out my week at 18 clients.
My goal is to be an intermediate Spanish speaker by the end of the year.  Continue with Olympic weightlifting, get back into Pole dancing, and learn about rappelling/Canyoneering to prepare for 3 weeks in the Azores this fall.

> **Response 2:** Success to me is owning my own time. ￼ Do I make a little bit more than working for an employer? Yes. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. ￼ I don’t have to ask anyone permission for ￼ anything

There’s so much noise in the Rehab coaching and entrepreneur space and honestly it makes me want to stay more quiet because noise is exhausting and confusing.

It’s hard to know where to turn and who to trust and what’s real vs exaggerated and I’ve seen a lot of people who have big goals get chewed up and spit out. 

These are typically people who have a mission and heart for service and are convinced that the only way towards joy and fulfillment in their life and business is to drive revenue. 

One of our values and missions at Uncaged is to help people build counter cultural businesses. 

Many people in this group have that same desire. They love their profession but hate the system they have to work in and feel like entrepreneurship is their only path forward. 

If that’s you, be careful who you’re following and who you surround yourself with. If your focus is building a counter cultural, values based business then surround yourself by others doing the same. 

If that’s you, join our traction week starting next Wednesday where we’ll walk through the process of building a counter cultural business that allows you to stay true to who you are.

If you’re interest comment “traction” and we’ll get you more details

Keep in mind this podcast is not strictly structured, and more conversation based...

Thank you to this group!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What is being done to advance direct access in all states. If we're supposed to be primary care providers for msk issues we need full direct access. 

Definitely the choice for Medicare patients to choose who they see.

If these things arent being done, why be a member? I stopped renewing because it wasn't worth it.

> **Response 2:** Hey Noe hope you and Natalie are doing well 

1. Opting out of Medicare. But that’s been said once or twice. 

2. Ordering labs/bloodwork/ imaging/ across the board not just state by state. 

3. Increasing reimbursement but that will give you the normal political answer of not In my control… 

4. What efforts are being made if any to create an Evaluation/management codes for us to use for maintaining health and longevity  ie cancer, ESRD, neuro conditions,  / or what efforts are being made for evaluating a patient referring to the appropriate provider of a different specialty?  Other providers get paid for this 

5. What efforts are being made for chart reviews of incoming complex patients? 

6. Does the US intent on ever moving towards the military model domestically and having DPTs prescribe, perform injections PRP etc like in so many other countries? 

7. What efforts are being done to stop insurance companies from “treating patients” using algorithms without a single licensed clinician reviewing the cases?  Think HR 238 which is set to allow technology to prescribe and treat diseases without a physician.

question
What do you guys do when an obviously rich patient is asking for a 50$ discount on your cash prices. I work in NYC and I think I charge pretty low (150$) and they want aquatic therapy with the pool in their temporary building which frankly I’d charge 180$ for. I don’t take their insurance. I’m not sure how to put my foot down about prices or try to come to a compromise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You respectfully tell them, "I dedicate a lot of time, effort, and resources to provide premium PT experience."  If they still want the the discount  tell them to kick rocks.

> **Response 2:** That’s one of the reasons they are rich. Never be ashamed to ask for a deal as a consumer. However, always be ready to politely explain why you don’t offer deals.

I have no idea where to begin on getting loans, business grants, etc. Where does a person even start when setting out to own their own business?

What do you think? Is this person avoiding  surgery? 35 yrs old, doesn't want Fusion and rods. I can help her but not sure it'll be enough to avoid surgery.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Surgery only with red flag symptoms… bowel/bladder changes, progressive muscle wasting/weakness, etc. 

Surgery for pain is a coin flip at best, dangerous at worst.

He’s 35… if otherwise healthy and uncomplicated non-surgical prognosis should be favorable. Natural history is favorable. Disc material resorption is very possible and even if not there are probably a million asymptomatic people walking around who would have the same findings in MRI.

> **Response 2:** One of my favorite professor quotes: I’d have to be peeing on my own drop foot before I got rods in my back.

**Community Responses:**

How did I miss this this week??? Who went? What was the outcome?? Why wasn’t this all over the place?? Not only did I not see it all over I didn’t see it all ALL ANYWHERE. Link below 👇🏼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I went.  Got multiple emails about it ahead of time....starting in Jan/Feb timeframe I believe.  About 1/4 of the PTs there were private practice owners.  You're split up by states and you schedule meetings ahead of time with your senators and local districts.  I also went 5 years ago.  It's impossible for a lot of PTs to go because you absolutely cannot put 20+ PTs in a meeting room with a congressman...they physically wouldn't all fit.  BUT that isn't to say that when your representatives are back home and away from DC that you meet up with them and advocate for what you want to see change.  That really is the best way and I've done that many times here.

**Original Post:**
Seeking advice for my aunt…
I must be a dinosaur…It seems to me that a TKR should receive more frequent PT than only 2x/week in post-op home PT.
My formative days after PT school were spent in intensive rehab (which doesn’t seem to exist anymore). We saw TKR and THR BID 7 days from post op day 1 until they were D/c’d home from rehab.

I know the current trend is to send patients home on post op day 1 with HH PT….I fail to see how this is effective for rehab or achieving the minimal ROM…..
Am I missing something?  
Should my aunt (with Medicare) be receiving more than 2 45 minute sessions of PT per 7 day week or is this the new norm?  (I am horrified if so).
(Oh, and because it is a holiday week, she “might be seen”)

If this is the new norm, I am concerned that she’ll never get the ROM she needs to function.
So the next question is…how soon can we get her to OP PT and would that have better frequency of treatment? Will she have better outcomes if she transitions to OP PT after 1 week at home (vs 4 weeks of 2x/week).

Can you hear my frustration?  I cannot believe that this level of care has the same outcomes as my patients in the 1990’s.

I would love to hear thoughts and suggestions for how I can guide this care. Do we push it with the surgeon to require more PT?  
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Let’s find a mobile therapist in your area! She could do that in lieu of HH.  That way she would get better care (more than likely) and be getting out-patient care sooner - but in the home!

> **Response 2:** Honestly the biggest obstacle to overcome is fear, and for most people pain = breaking something which feeds their fear. I literally don’t even lay hands on a TKR for ROM as I teach the patients what they need to be doing, and the only problems I’ve had are ones I inherited from other therapists. I’d be💯comfortable doing a fresh TKR completely virtually. Same with other post op patients as well.

So a personal trainer can charge cash to a client with Medicare for training but a Physical therapist with a personal training certification cannot?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Use an ABN that states wellness, general conditioning is not a covered benefit.  Keep on file.  It’s good for a year.

> **Response 2:** You can. They just can’t have a physical ailment that your training could be considered treatment for. If it’s not skilled care (they finished a course of PT already) or they simply aren’t injured, you could provide cash based services that do not include a physical therapy skilled service/evaluation etc. you would want very clear signed paperwork to distinguish your services ofcourse. And look at your state specific practice act.

Exposure. No one can really be serious. it’s been 24 hours. My guess was 625 the first day. This is how many people have signed requesting APTA help intervene (this one specifically UHC) with fraudulent insurance companies. This is EXACTLY what I ran into filing my class action wage labor suits. 95% complained and whined and only 8.5% signed on once I filed and 97% had the audacity to TAKE their overtime and attempt to thank me after they shot me down with filing 🤣🤣🤣 (I can’t repeat what I responded to them here). Can’t complain AND not do anything. That doesn’t mix well.

Wanted to share a win and a lesson…

I had a client this month tell me before initial eval that he didn’t think he could afford my services.

I explained a few points about my value and he decided to book the initial eval only.

He ended up purchasing a 4 session package and had amazing outcomes.

Then during the month he was working with me he decided to also invest in a $5,000 home gym.

NEVER apologize for your pricing and what you bring to the table.

Choosing to work with me likely spurred him to invest in his health further 5x what he ever spent in my office.

We are changing people’s lives…don’t forget that.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love posts like these. It truly shifts perspectives. There is a buyer at every price point for every market. 

There are people who value this as a service at this price point while others don’t.

This isn’t a comparison of industries as much as its conviction to charge higher, belief in value provided, and selling to the right market that values it at that price point. 

We often can’t sell at higher rates because we’re judging someone else’s pockets as if it’s our own, or trying to sell to someone who doesn’t value the service already. 

I’m glad this was shared in here. Always shows what is possible if we’re willing to see it.

Hello everyone, 
I am anonymously posting this to avoid having issues at my current full time job. 
I want to know if it is actually possible to go solo with an LLC, mostly do cash based and grow at least to a decent salary?
Who has done this?
Who has made it happen in the last year?
I would like to hear from you please. 

I am sure a lot of us in this group are working full time in a busy private practice, tired of seeing 12 + patients a day and thinking..... is there something better out there?
Can I make it on my own?

Please share your experiences, if it has worked for you, what is your current success story or if it has not worked for you. 

I am just trying to make life decisions at this moment and would love to hear from PTs that felt caged in and where able to uncage themselves. 

Thank you so much in advance :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got uncaged when I got fired. So I didn't have any choice but to make it work. 😭😭😭 Now I'm caged again in our clinic. Lol. 

Kidding aside, like what Anthony Maritato mentioned. You already know the science of therapy. What you need to learn is the art and science of marketing yourself to the public. 

Like what the great Captain David Bayliff said. Be famous in your community and be so popular that people will say, huh, I want to go to that amazing therapist. And also stop posting anonymously too. 😁😁😁 just kidding. 

You got this! You go get it my friend! 🔥🔥🔥

> **Response 2:** I see about 12-15 pts a week, working 3 days a week. On track for a 100k+ year. I’m coming up on my 3rd anniversary this November. 

I keep overhead low. I rent a small space. I don’t work every week and take off lots of days to manage my kids and their school schedules. 

It’s possible.

In Sarasota off Honore. If anyone knows of anyone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pay more. It’s simple. If you pay more and offer good benefits and actual work/life balance, they will come. Therapists are leaving the field in masses because they can’t pay their massive loans, have to treat multiple patients at one time and have no work/life balance. Create a good environment for them, be VERY clear and transparent in your posting. Don’t play games with recruiters, salaries, make it an easy choice for them.

**Original Post:**
I’ve been a cash based therapist and personal trainer for a year now working out of my home studio. 

I’m still really struggling with my fees. My therapy clients are my easiest. I see them, they leave, and I’m done. My personal training clients require significant more work. I see them, they leave, then I’m busy making exercise programs for them, finding an inspiring podcast or article for them to read, analyzing their nutrition logs for them, etc. 

It seems as if I should be charging more for using the skills of my therapy/masters degree, however so much more work is involved with my personal training clients. 

1/2 my clients get a combo of both services. So how would you break down fees for services? Just have a flat fee for all my services regardless of what they are receiving?

My other problem is 50-75% of people that email me inquiring my service rates don’t respond after I tell them. In comparison to all the other local gyms (I did my research) I’m on the lower side. 

Thoughts? 
(Latest social media post photo for the hell of it.)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same rate you offer your rehab patients. You are practicing at your highest degree and your admin time should be considered.

> **Response 2:** Personally I’d charge a higher price point because although I may wear  many hats, what’s underneath the hat is always the same.  You’re always going to be thinking at your highest skill level and you’re a good PT who cares about motivating your clients, know your value. The clients who pay for having a good PT who also trains (because it’s not as common as you may think) are the ones you want to keep anyway. 

Charge more so you can provide a better product and ultimately work less

So, Im official!!! After bootcamp, I officially quit my job and started Key Performance, LLC. My first full week, I had 26 patients scheduled! It was insane!!!! I have been doing a side hustle for about 3 months, but decided to jump.
My first snags to old school came up this week. And I need a little help. If I use Google calendar,  is there a reminder system that's hippa compliant that I can use inexpensively? I'm just starting out, nd don't want an emr because I prefer to write my notes, so don't need pteverywhere or the like. But, sending reminders has already gotten old. So, looking for something that will interface with my Google calendar easily and automatically send reminders the day before. Thanks!

I've only been an OT for 4 years and I'm burnt out as I suffer from imposter syndrome. (I'm short and look young)  I am ready to get out of this field due to my personal mental health, political red tapes, productivity standards, and decreased quality of life. 

I know a RN who did the acupuncture master program and started her own acupuncture, massage and sound bath wellness clinic. 
I would like to go into wellness and start cashpay (higher pay, less oversight) 

What kind of services can I offer other than "teach patients to get better at ADLs"

It seems like ppl are prone to spend money on positive experience and something that makes them "feel good" instead being told what to do by therapist. 

Appreciate any insight, recommendations on ceu/class or programs to embark on my new journey.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you everyone for taking the time out of your day to help me brainstorm. 
I'm the first person in my family to attend college and do not have a mentor in personal or professional development. 

You are all asking the right questions to help me guide my career, I hope to find the right answer based on everyone's experience and wisdom. Appreciate you all for sharing.

Hey all. Any recommendations on Jane App vs. PT Everywhere? Hoping to start taking clients for my cash-based PT biz in Feb and looking to select an EMR that streamlines everything (scheduling, documentation, HEP, billing/invoice/superbills, etc.)!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just finished setting up all my stuff with Jane. I did demos with both and chose Jane partly due to aesthetics but also price. I did set up a separate fax number through SRFax for like $111 for the year, though I haven’t had to use it yet. Jane connects to physitrack for HEP’s, though I’m probably going to have to upload my own exercises as I haven’t found what I want for my pregnant and postpartum clients on there yet. I found it very easy to follow the virtual guidance for setting up staff (I’m the only clinician), scheduling, visit types with rates (I’m also using Jane payments through Stripe), creating templates, and creating intake forms with consents. It took me a few days, maybe a week, to get things the way I want it, but coming from HCHB in home health, I am SO excited to use a more streamlined EMR that isn’t just checking off a bunch of insurance-mandated requirements that do not pertain to my patient or their treatment!

> **Response 2:** I’ve used both and I’m obsessed with Jane now. The only downside is that Jane doesn’t hav e-fax built in (yet).

They also provide a “helper rate” that saves you $25/month on whichever plan you go with. With wanting to do superbills I’d go with the insurance place. 

The aesthetic, patient satisfaction, and customer service is seriously unparalleled!

I have a client who's feeling really down about her TKR that she can't get full ROM out of. She's 4 months post op and current AROM is 6-103. Dr refuses to do a MUA bc he was worried he'd break her femur (she has extensive scar tissue from an accident thirty years ago). No other surgeon will touch it until she's a year post op. Right now we are continuing to stretch and stretch and stretch, but she's feeling frustrated and wanted to know how often this happens and what the outcomes are. I told her I'd poll the group bc I wasn't sure. Thank you for any input!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A few other considerations:
What was her ROM prior to TKR? In severe OA cases ROM can be quite compromised prior to Sx. Long term soft tissue contractures, muscle atrophy and fascial restrictions can take a long time to improve. 
Function is far more important than end ROM. 
Inflammation of local soft tissue and scarring can decrease over time. Patience is key. 
Pilates reformer exercises can work magic on TKRs.

> **Response 2:** My 2 cents:
1. How about focusing on function rather than pain. 
2. Her AROM is really good at 4 months, could also be that pain is inhibiting you from stretching further. Maybe she is over stretching and over doing her exercises. It is ok to decrease intensity and frequency to calm her pain down 
3. Icing is known to decrease C fiber activity. You can try stretch - ice massage- stretch- ice massage …my experience with TKR, their knee tend to get very hot with movement 
4. Educate and re assure that she is progressing well - if patient sees that you are worried, she gets worried as well which will contribute to her pain experience 
5. Celebrate small wins

In my 7 years of practice, I have seen several TKR  cases from many years ago who were not able to achieve full ROM but they are not limited to what they can do

Update. All cleaned. Got my EMR.  Got my faxing service. Marketing Photoshoot today!!!! 

Waiting on branding, logo, website, and social media marketing but it’s all starting today!! 

My goal was 10 visits a week. I know it’s only been ONE week of hitting my goal, but I had 10 visits this week and I’m so excited. 

How does everyone market to keep evals coming in? I’ve heard some people just do social media, some only send their evaluation notes back to the patients primary care provider to keep your name in the back of their minds…stopping in and giving business cards?? 

My dream is coming true 🥰🥰🥰

Great idea for anyone afraid to start. I found out this morning my state, Illinois on average for a facility that accepts Medicaid has a wait list of 1300 patients, approximately 8 to 9 months 
To be seen for ￼for physical therapy. Start here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not worth the money for medicaid unfortunately

> **Response 2:** My experience from working in an insurance based hospital network outpatient facility: Medicaid patients were the most likely to no-show (and you cannot charge them a no show fee). So I think that unless the patient is especially motivated, you may still end up “twiddling your fingers”. 
In my state, there is a protracted process to get Medicaid auth after eval (front desk always had to spend hours on the phone tracking these down each week), and they took about 2 weeks to come through. And on top of it, we had to send physical (hard copy) paper work into the state to get these approvals. 
Yes, it’s important for them to get affordable healthcare but I think that our services being essentially free for the patient meant there was less “skin in the game” for them. 
They are a population that deserves to be served but unfortunately it is just not feasible for some of us to serve them and still make a living. For a small, single practitioner office, it just doesn’t work.

Stopping in to leave a very Biased opinion. I just hit my first huge month since going full time in my mobile business. I attribute a ton if it to the wisdom and advice of David Bayliff!!! 
He has helped me every step of the way! 

Taught me how to approach other professionals with a serving attitude instead of what can they do for me! 

Explained how to use word of mouth to grow!

Educated me on how to set up partnerships in my community. 

Mentored me on marketing and how I talk about what I do. 

He has been so valuable to me and I can’t thank him enough! 

I’ve also known Kevin DeGroot for about 9 years now and you canNOT find 2 better men who want to help you and grow your business. If you’re in the fence about working with them, JUMP to the other side! 

They will never do anything to hurt you and are excellent guides!!!

**Original Post:**
2012.  Review time.

We all dread those meetings with our superiors.

We are required to fill out forms answering questions about how WE think we have been performing.  Then, we are asked about our goals over the next 6 months and 1 year.

After 18 years of showing up to this rodeo, I knew that MY goals didn’t matter - unless they were to attend certain CEU courses, increase my units/visit charged, and to see more patients.

How did I think I did?

Well, I think I got a lot of people better, back to living their lives, and happy that they had me as a therapist.

However, you tell me, Mr. Director.

This review was probably like ones you have been through.  And not unlike most others I had experienced.

There was the discussion that if I added just three more exercises to the patient’s (ther-ex) program at least every other day, how it would positively impact my yearly bonus.

Speaking of adding exercises, this would also help to get my average units/visit up.  This would get me out of “last place” for the entire company.

My director then requested that I start documenting each week as to why a patient did not attend treatments 3x/wk for that week.  If a patient was discharged, give justification because everyone needed to be seen at a minimum of 15 visits.

As far as documentation went, I needed to get my discharges done sooner.

The response to my goals: “Well, I think those are some good goals.”

Period.

The final outcome:

I wasn’t going to get my full 2% raise because of my shortcomings on the metrics.

You know, the ones that had ZERO to do with patients improving, meeting THEIR goals (which they did).  The goals which they expected us (me) to help them to achieve.

No 2% raise because I focused too much on the patients.

There were many straws during my last 5-6 years with the Establishment.  This was the last one.

However, what was I to do?

I was done with the long hours.

I was done with the endless paperwork.

I was certainly done dealing with the insurance companies.

But, what else was there for me as a therapist?  Being a PT was all I knew.

That was when a patient asked me if I would like to take over for a person who worked with residents in her community.  This individual was moving out of state.  She felt that I was the perfect fit.

Without hesitation I said: “Heck YEAH!”

Scared, nervous, anxious, worried, excited?

Yep.  All of the above.

I didn’t know what I was doing.  No one else was doing this sort of thing.  But I did know one thing: I believed in me.

Where did that decision take me?

I was able to move out of a one bedroom apartment and into a house.  This meant that my kids would now have their own bedrooms.  (BTW, the demands of corporate healthcare were the catalyst to my divorce.)

I was now able to save a little money each month.

I took time off when I wanted.  My clients didn’t mind.  They supported my taking time to myself.

I attended my kids’ school events.

And I got to focus on what mattered the most about being a therapist - helping people to achieve THEIR goals.

Now, I am blessed to work alongside my friends, Josh and Kevin, to help other clinicians break free from the corporate world, and to become uncaged in their own lives - personally and professionally.

I know that making such a decision is probably the hardest one you will ever make; more so than choosing a partner or spouse.

That is why at UNCAGED we walk with you step-by-step.

We are the safety net beneath you until your wings are strong enough to carry you.

Summer is around the corner.  It’s a great time to learn how to spread those wings.

So for all those that think PTs, PTAs, OTs, OTAs, and billers do not go to jail and that it must be okay because we got paid and everyone does it, you might want to google search Hertel and Brown case. 20 therapists, assistants, and billers indicted plus the company. 17 of the PTs, PTAs, and billers, including the 2 owners, have now pled guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud.

The 2 owners will receive a 6-year prison sentence in federal prison followed by 3 years of supervised release. Essentially, their careers are over. Other 15 have sentences scheduled in May, June, and July.

The other 3 have jury selection start tomorrow. 

This is why documentation, CPT coding, billing, etc., should be mandatory CEU requirements for all therapists and assistants.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So, they did things that we all know are wrong? Right?

> **Response 2:** Scary!! Reading one of the articles is says they billed for services not provided and billed as if provided by a PT when a tech provided. I hope no one here is doing these things!! Great reminder to document what you do and charge for what you do

This is the message I got from my patient today after going to her ortho follow up with her. I’ve heard Anthony Maritato talk about going to MD appts with patients several times. David Bayliff and I have been talking about how to network too! 

Since starting my mobile business I want to do things differently than I’ve done in the past and try to add as much value as I can. 

She is my first patient. She is seeing a local ortho doc that I have met a few times and grew up with a ton of people I grew up with. 

She had a distal humerus fracture and wore her sling 4 weeks longer than she should have. She couldn’t get PT here because she had out of state BCBS. A friend of a friend gave her my number. 

When I first saw her, she was in tears after her ortho postop visit. They told her to do PT 4x/wk, get dynasplint and she would need about 4 months of PT to even hope of getting her range back. She’s 35 c 3 kids and was scared to death. 

I gave her my rate and we decided on once a week if she would do exactly what she was supposed to do. 

After week 3 we decided on the dynasplint. Yesterday was week 6 of PT at once a week and week 3 of the dynasplint. She maxed out the extension component of the brace. 

We went into the visit missing about 5 degrees of ext and of flex. When she started she was stuck about 5-10 from 80 both ways. 

Also her bone wasn’t healing when she went last time. 

She is still not completely healed, but they released her back to work and scheduled her for 3 months out. 

I was nervous about going, because I didn’t want it to be about what I was doing there, but wanted to see if this actually made a difference in her outcome and her perceived value. I think her text and her Google review shows the value. 

Please make time to do this. I also got to talk to the ortho doc and PA. I had never met the PA. I got to share a funny story with them about texting someone who I thought was the doc (they will remember that because they all made fun of the doc afterwards in good fun). I spent about 5 minutes with the ortho MD who have me his cell number and asked how he could send more people to me. 

My plan is to focus more on the direct primary care and concierge docs in town, but I want to spend time with anyone I can to show the value I’m providing. 

This is purposely long to show how much personal value i got from this and how much my patient felt honored and cared for with this experience. 

Just do it!!!

Are you aware that at any time, a politically appointed (not elected) state board can strip you of your license — your career, your reputation, your livelihood — over a treatment you’ve never received a single complaint about?

They don’t even need to cite a valid regulation. In fact, they don’t have to follow any existing regulation at all. They can invent one on the spot, and weaponize it against you — retroactively — to destroy everything you’ve built. And if you think poor reimbursement is the biggest threat to our profession, just wait until you experience being professionally erased without cause or accountability.

This is what our field has become.

And when it happens to you? Don’t expect help from:
 • The APTA
 • The FSBPT
 • The Governor, AG, or your legislators
 • Any civil rights or whistleblower organization

They’ll all say how terrible your situation is — but none of them will lift a finger. The system protects itself. The courts will side with other government agencies while your due process, constitutional rights, and professional dignity are obliterated.

If this can happen to one of us, it can happen to any of us.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** After an unblemished 20-year career with no prior complaints, my professional life was dismantled by a coordinated campaign of retaliation, regulatory overreach, and political targeting.

It began with a former employee who violated her non-compete agreement, admitted to taking patients, and settled out of court. That same individual, aligned with a direct competitor, threatened to “get even.” Shortly after, multiple complaints were filed—not for any treatment rendered, but for recommending a valid, evidence-based clinical option that was never even performed.

The very day my wife and I took possession of our new facility to expand our business, I was summarily suspended.

What followed was an unprecedented 15+ hour hearing that resembled a kangaroo court more than a fair administrative process:
 • All expert witnesses were excluded.
 • Over 300 letters of support from patients and providers were ignored.
 • The sitting Board president admitted he was unfamiliar with the applicable rules and regulations.
 • The lead investigator testified she hadn’t reviewed the case file or any of the submitted evidence.

Despite this, I was indefinitely suspended—initially for “no less than two years,” now approaching four—based solely on a recommendation, not a treatment, involving a patient who continued under my care for nearly a decade and never filed a complaint.

The charge? A non-existent regulation fabricated on the spot—retroactively applied to conduct from 2015—in blatant violation of the Administrative Process Act and the authority of the Virginia General Assembly. And these phantom rules? Enforced exclusively against me.

But it gets worse.

The Department of Health Professions (DHP), Board of Physical Therapy (BOPT), and Board of Nursing (BON) were complicit in altering medical records—falsely relabeling physical therapy patients as massage therapy clients. The BON, which has no jurisdiction over PT practice, then judged my physical therapy treatment under massage therapy standards. Although even they didn’t find the patient as credible as the BOPT claimed, they issued a formal reprimand—placing a blemish on my massage license for a patient who was never a massage client.

Now, nearly four years later, the Board is attempting to revoke my license permanently.

Meanwhile, the disciplinary double standard is staggering:
 • A female PT who had sexual relations with multiple patients received probation.
 • Another female PT who treated patients under the influence and received a DUI served a one-year suspension.
 • A Board “witness” who disregarded physician orders and patient consent continues to practice without sanction.
 • A male therapist who slept with a 19-year-old patient and practiced without a license was suspended for under a year—with no ongoing restrictions.
 • Another male therapist arrested twice for sexual assault was suspended for three months the first time, one year the second—and is now back in practice, unrestricted.

Yet I remain indefinitely suspended—nearly four years and counting—for recommending a clinically valid, expert-supported treatment option that has never drawn a single patient complaint.

This is not regulation. This is retribution.
This is not oversight. This is targeted persecution.
And unless it is exposed, it will continue to happen to others.

Question (my apologies if this has been asked). I am a sports PT and have my CSCS. I have recently been approached by two people who want me to train them privately. I do not hold a personal training cert specifically. I have heard in a lawsuit they can go after your highest license so I definitely want to protect myself. Is this something I can offer to people under “wellness” making it clear it is not PT? If so, what are some things I should consider setting up ahead of time such as an LLC, liability insurance, consent forms reviewed by a lawyer etc? Want to ensure I’m strategic about this. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You definitely always want to delineate between skilled PT services and non skilled PT services whether you name it wellness or something else. However, in a court of law, and to your state PT board,  you can't be a PT sometimes and not be a PT other times. We are always PTs and we give advice and guidance based off of our expertise as PTs. This is why you can train someone in a wellness AND a rehab program. Your malpractice insurance covers you, it doesn't delineate whether or not you're doing PT stuff bc your are a always a PT.

> **Response 2:** Yup! LLC I would just have your name & wellness (not required, just a double safety net) clear consent / client contract forms they sign “understand this is not PT” , and get liability insurance to cover that highest degree

Just sharing with like minds. This is my grandmas knee X-ray (permission to post). She has her TKA scheduled Tuesday this week. What the HECK!! Calcified quad tendon? Her joint surfaces actually look pretty good, right? I don’t read X-ray a lot but dang. How did this happen lol. And/or what the heck is this going on here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** i'm sure that a strength deficit from a dysfunctional quad tendon can make her buckle easily  and fall. How old is she, is she walking with a device. You can most certainly delay the surgery while you get a 2nd and 3rd opinion; A quad tendon repair will be no fun but more appropriate than a TKR.

> **Response 2:** There are clear osteophytes and a decrease in joint space. That looks like a clear case of knee OA to me. Surgeons always tell patients that they're the ones to say when it's time for surgery. So if she's in pain and it's limiting her day to day function, do the TKA.

I have salaried PT’s at my office.

We are closing down tomorrow due to potential bad weather where we are. Would this count as a day off for the PT’s and they use PTO? I’m not sure how to go about doing this since we have never had this happen.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would be furious if my employer closed and charged me a PTO day....especially if I worked hard to pick up the slack on other days.

> **Response 2:** My experience is if you are closing-  the therapists don’t get penalized. They don’t need to take PTO if the clinic owner closes the office. If they decide to not come in but the office is open- then they use PTO

So looking again with frustration at all the other practices that encroach no matter how inappropriate. Maybe not taught kinesiology, physiology for a reason. Where is APTA protecting us. Other than dry needling. I can do more with less restrictions as a trainer or massage therapist. Sorry but frustrated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My frustration is more about the restrictions placed on PT and not other disciplines providing the same service. If it's safe for them without restrictions then why not us. As a PT, I can not take cash from a Medicare recipient but as a massage therapist or trainer I can. Ridiculous. I applauded anyone who takes the time to expand their toolbox, and provide great care, but as a PT, I expand mine and then limited as to what I can do, how I bill, who I have to report to. Just frustrating.

> **Response 2:** This is going to be an unpopular opinion but anyone with a brain and a desire can learn to do any of this online these days and can be highly effective and impactful to their clients. I think this mostly makes us upset as PTs because we went through the system, spent a crap ton of time and money and now seemingly have to compete with non PTs for the same clients. Personally, besides the foundational knowledge which is actually part of all healthcare curriculum, everything I learned that’s applicable and used on a daily basis came after school. This ad attracts me- this person admits their education was lacking, has intimate knowledge of the feel of structures and went above and beyond to educate themselves properly regarding strengthening. Kudos to them.

Hey friends. I had a new patient come in this week with bed bugs literally crawling on her. I picked them off and smashed them between my fingers as I saw them 😫. I felt bad because she was embarrassed and admitted she’s had a bug problem. Turns out, she lives in an apartment where my bug guy says is “bed bug heaven”. I don’t know what the ethical and legal thing to do is. She needs PT but I can’t be putting my clinic, my home and my patient’s homes at risk. Also, I have another new patient on my waiting list who lives in the same building. Bed bugs can be next to impossible to get rid of. Anyone have experience with this kind of situation?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ooo I have gotten bed bugs from patients before, and I am very passionate about this subject! I have worked for a few different clinics and agencies that say different things. The one that infuriates me the most is that we cannot discriminate because they have bed bugs. The one that makes the most sense is that we cannot see them until they no longer have an infestation, because it is a contamination. It is unrelated to their personal hygiene and cleanliness, and they can travel so easily. You don't want them in your carpet, or climbing up others patients legs. The first time I got them from a patient, it took 6 months to get out! It sucks because it is really embarrassing, and such a challenging thing to control, but you have to think about the clinic as a whole. You wouldn't let someone with a cute covid come in without a mask or any protection, because it could infect you and other patients, right? I would transition her to virtual appointments if possible.

> **Response 2:** Legally they classify as having contact precautions when there is visual bedbugs. So room isolation and gowns, gloves and hair/foot protection is advisable. Just like if they’re in a hospital, contact is contact.

Hey all - some of you know me well, others don't but I'm trying hard to push to win this this year. If you don't mind taking literally a minute to vote for us as best PT in Pensacola I would appreciate it!

There is literally a chiropractor leading the way who does not employ a physical therapist! Technically this is illegal but whatever. 

Please help me prevent this and help me win it!

I want to give a testimonial to Kevin DeGroot, Josh Payne, David Bayliff, and all the staff at UNCAGED CLINICIAN. My partner and I left our full time jobs at the end of September 2023 and were very nervous about how long it would take us to replace our salaries again with starting from zero. Because of the guidance, consistent meetings, frequent check-ins, and camaraderie facilitated amongst other practitioners by Uncaged Clinician; my partner and I were able to pay ourselves back any loans we gave the business and replace our pay checks just 5 months into business! Let me stress, we had to fill TWO schedules, so we knew it would take us longer to reach fully booked status as compared to solo entrepreneurs. We are highly impressed that with the training we received, and A LOT of elbow grease, we have had raving success that we feel is set up to last for a long time. If you are considering becoming uncaged and don't know where to start, or are nervous to take the leap, sign up for a discovery call with these guys! They are all about personal development and community building along side the business education.

Not sure if I can post this here - lmk where I can post if not allowed:
Update: 10/7/25 @6mos post-op (4/11/25 Surgery)
For those who commented on recs and knowledge, thank you! Here is the status of her shoulder. We’ve gotten 3 other opinions from ortho docs and they all agree it looks like it’s buldging out. One doc is calling the rep of the hardware company and asking what size was put in. Another Doc said it looks like it was placed at an angle and more lateral or anterior than he would’ve placed it. But that doesn’t mean that it warrants a revision. The deltoid appears to be missing anteriorly ??? but she’s able to flex at shoulder to 90*, 2/5 MMT w/ pain/wincing. The sunken look is progressively getting worse.  

We are hoping the rep says that a partial revision can be done to replace with a smaller disc between the neck of the hardware and the ball without replacing the entire set. Anyone have insight to this situation?!

Updated info: I need advice from ortho PTs.
My (medicare/75yo) mom’s reverse total shoulder 3.5 mos post-op prosthetic looks odd. 
It keeps catching w/ pain 10/10. Doc says it’ll take time and patience. He used an off-the-shelf prosthetic and says he rarely orders custom. Are off-the-shelf cheaper??? How can I be reassured it’s the correct size since he’s sure it’s the correct size? She was 120* should flexion and now 85* with bruising post 4 days ago, she reached up behind her head to put her sling on to just rest it and she got stuck 10/10 worst pain shes ever been in…she didnt hear a pop, but could it have dislocated? Doc says maybe so but didn’t give us a plan post subluxation. He said to rest it, dont do IR for awhile, and itll “heal”. 😳

So many red flags during our visit today showing no compassion and strong resistance to admitting anything other than she needs to be patient. He actually called to apoligized but it was a,”Im sorry, but…” apology.  Rated TOP REVERSE shoulder doc in Austin, TX and he said he is 1 of 6 who created this prosthetic!? What do we do? We have a 2nd opinion in a week. I’m in shock for my mom. 🙏 feri e t

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve treated many rTSA’s and just based on the images that DOES NOT LOOK NORMAL. Clearly she has significant atrophy so I’m concerned about nerve damage, but also the component doesn’t even look like it’s fitting properly. Yes reverse shoulder replacements can take six months up to a year to feel somewhat normal but if she is still struggling even with just functional movements, then a second opinion is absolutely needed. Hope that helps 🙏￼

> **Response 2:** Sulcus like that can be prothesis but more commonly the deltoid weakness and scapular mm weakness is not assisting stabilizing inferior component. The deltoid is essentially the new prime mover for elevation so rtc atrophy like that happens. She will never have normal g/h pattern thats just reality of the surgery. I have seen large sulcus’ like this- hardware was intact- there was just such long standing weakness . Rehab takes really long- lots of deltoid isometrics- I would make sure her PT is experienced in treating this.She could also have some adhesions forming limiting the rom and that is super painful too… (think freezing phase of frozen shoulder). I would also use kinesiotape if safe on her skin to stabilize

So, get this: Samuel anointed David to be king right in front of his dad and brothers. Can you believe it? 

They didn't believe in him and even left him out in the fields with the sheep when Samuel came around. 

And to top it off, his own brothers made fun of him and tried to bring him down. But David didn't let their negativity get to him. 

Same thing happened to me. Not that I was sold into slavery. Lol. But I do have a lot of haters, plenty of people who doubted me, family who don't like me and etc etc etc... Just because...

Here is the thing. If you show that you can ignore the haters and trust in God. He'll bless you in front of those who tried to push you down. God knows how to throw a party for you right in front of your enemies. He's not going to promote you in secret, but He'll promote you where those who doubted you will see you shine like a star. 

Listen, it's important to be respectful to others, but don't let their doubts and negativity cancel out what God has put in your heart. Just ignore all that noise and get ready to see the greatness of God. Trust me, it's gonna be epic.

I am contemplating adding a subscription type service for PT.  A monthly fee.  I am wondering if anyone here had successfully done something like this?  

I starting completely mobile, but am now hybrid.  I want to grow my in person/clinic visits and hoping to add some value by doing this.  

Any insight from someone who has done thus would be appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The concept works. It makes it easier from a billing standpoint. Allows for less administrative work. 

Your best bet is to limit how many visits per month. Plus you need a certain number of people ready to sign up. 

Say you only have 15 people the first 6 months that have subscriptions. If you're charging $200 to $250 per month, you're only bringing in $3000 to $3750. It would seem like charging more would be the thing, but people are already paying monthly for health insurance. If you're in a more affluent location, this may be fine. So location/population are key factors. Also having enough people that want to sign up for it. 

Subscription models for PT aren't common and it may take more convincing for others to join.

Pairing up with organizations/clinics that do concierge model of Healthcare is important.

I don't have all the answers to this model. I've been trying it out for a while. It has its plus and minuses.

> **Response 2:** I'd be interested if anybody does this monthly subscription model for PT in states like California where you'd have to get the POC signed within 30 days or X # visits.

The first photo came up in my memories today. It was my first “office” 10 years ago.

It was a 6x10 walk in closet in a chiropractor’s office that I turned into a cozy therapy room.  My table was on furniture sliders it was so small.  Don’t ever let someone tell you a space is too small to launch your dream.  

The remaining photos are of my treatment room inside the wellness center I own today. 

The initial growth my business experienced came through inspiration but this past year it came through “growing pains” instead. 

The memory of my first office popping up today reminded me of the sensation and feeling of inspiration I had for the first 10 years in business. It made me realize that over the past year I’ve been functioning in a mode of fear/lack. Finally recognizing this, I was able to transition back into inspiration and wonderment.  Such a sign of relief!🥰

I hope you all find some inspiration or wonderment in your businesses today as well!! 💕💕

Do you know when everything changed for me in business?

When I stopped reading everything and looking for the secret sauce.

I read over 110 business books when I first started my practice in 2016…

I still made tons of mistakes and had to learn on the fly.

And the most eye-opening part?

I’ve re-read many of those books and ONLY about FIVE of them are actually worth keeping and implementing.

We live in a world where information is almost too abundant. Stop information gathering, and start implementing 👊. You will be thankful you did. 😃

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** The RIGHT book at the RIGHT time can help tremendously, so dont hear me completely wrong. I just want to save people from over-consuming. Implementation is the #1 ingredient needed to get a business moving. Ill post the five books later and when they were helpful

In addition, I partnered with a local OP clinic I’ve been going to personally for a year and they’ll be sending me patients that have transportation issues or want it at their home.

For anyone with a business that your started before 2024, there are two legal things you need to do by the end of the year:
1. Authenticate Your Domain through your email provider (to comply with a new law and not have your emails go to spam)
1. File for BOI (to confirm you are the owner) - https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/

Note: I apologize, but I do not have time to go into details about these things. These are based on two laws that came out this year for business owners. I am not an expert, but was guided by one of my mentors/friends who owns a business that this is something to do.

I’ve been getting a lot of DMs about shockwave therapy things like which device to choose, how to approach certain conditions, and which courses are actually worth the time , sorry I am unable to answer all of them . Since many of us are exploring similar things, I thought it might be helpful to hop on a casual Zoom call and discuss as a group.
No agenda just an open, supportive chat to share experiences and support each other . If you’re interested, DM me and I , I’ll set it up!

Get comfortable talking about pay. I was at a dry needling course this weekend and met multple cash PTs. It was interesting hearing the spectrum of what others were charging for regular visits . Per visit some charged 110, some 225 and one guy charges 400 per visit for his Utah practice . I have never heard of a therapist charging 400 per visit. He said sells packages of 6 visits so about $2400. It is good for me to hear those numbers to hear what is possible.

**Community Responses:**

So PT can’t accept cash from a Medicaid patient if they want more services but they can pay a diatician??    🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Logic??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Stupid law, but the whole point of Medicaid is financial assistance. If they can afford to private pay for any clinician, they probably need to get off Medicaid. At least, that's how the government sees it. I know it's more complicated than that.

> **Response 2:** If  Medicare is primary insurance and Medicaid secondary, you can not balance bill the patient if you are not a Medicaid provider. You have to follow Medicare billing rules for non covered services (ABN, still bill MC, etc) if what you provide is not covered by MC.
However, if your patient is not Medicare recipient and has only Medicaid, then ability to charge cash for PT is state specific. I am in Florida.I called and emailed to the Florida Medicaid and was told that I can collect cash for PT services if I am not a Medicaid provider.

MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT. 

TLDR: register for the Uncaged Clinician Community and App launch party using the link in the comments! 

Honestly this is the biggest thing we've ever done at Uncaged Clinician and our team is so excited to start sharing it with you! 

We're in a unique position that we've been asked to leverage for the betterment of PTs, OTs, SLPs, Chiros, Mental Health Providers and more. At first, Josh Payne, David Bayliff and myself wanted to "stay in our lane" and focus on coaching and mentorship but this changes NOW. 

This group has evolved and grown through the last several years and although the growth is exciting, it's also very sad that the level of satisfaction and fulfillment in healthcare seems to be plummeting. 

We all have our thoughts on why this is the case but we're all fighting in isolation and lack a common voice and space for grassroots change and growth. 

Will we "fix" healthcare in the US? probably not, but the goal that we have is to unify the voices of PTs, OTs, SLPs, and more and stop the infighting that keeps us from collective growth. 

In order to bring us more together, we're launching a community platform and app that focuses on clinical and business development, resourcing clinicians, mentorship, collaboration, accountability, and community and we want YOU to be a part of it. 

Yes this will take time and yes there will be some kinks that need to be ironed out but we need a group of clinicians who are willing to be trailblazers with us to help move this mission forward. 

All that being said, we are hosting an EXCLUSIVE training and launch party on March 22nd at 8:00 pm eastern to teach you, motivate you, and show you what we've been working on. 

Spaces in the training are limited and spaces for the trailblazers on the app are going to be limited as we continue to grow and launch this to more and more people! 

Register using the link below and give this post some love because we want to make sure everyone in this group knows that we're on a mission to unify voices in our fields and reinvigorate the passion that you once had for loving, serving, caring, and leading others in healthcare.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So pumped!! This is going to change the game for our profession and healthcare as a whole

> **Response 2:** Let’s GO Uncaged Clinicians!! Want to bring our profession together in a really unique way that hasn’t been done yet? We believe this is the beginning of so much! Get signed up ⬆️

Wondering if any of you pay your employees per patient that they see rather than per hour? We do charge a no-show or cancellation fee, but I have had quite a few lately and I don't feel like my PT's who are in the office are incentivized enough to maybe contact somebody on the waiting list when they rather just sit around. This is something I have discussed with them already but wondering if a flat rate per patient that is higher than what they get paid per hour would incentivize them more to keep their schedule full. Just wanted to get your thoughts

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ARE they literally sitting around? When do they finish extra paperwork, contact physicians, consult with coworkers on challenging cases, review continuing education, prepare in advance for the rest of the day/week? All of this is work.

What is the general view of using manual muscle tests as an objective measure of progress? Our clinic is trying to steer few of us veterans away from using manual muscle tests and it feels like they just don't want to go through the hassle of doing them. I feel like they are really easy to do and can be measurable goals. They are also indicating that there's not enough inter-rater reliability, but that actually means to me that they require more skills in this area as opposed to me needing to simply use the manual muscle test less. Please give me your thoughts all for or opposed.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Research proves they're unreliable and they're not objective at all once you get higher than 3 where the strength becomes subjective based on the rater and proper stabilization and positioning. 
I think they can be helpful for low level patients but functional measures like STS and TUG are much more objective, repeatable, reliable and obviously functional.

> **Response 2:** There’s no harm in doing it. If you don’t want to use it for goal setting then fine, but it takes 2 seconds to perform and the patient also gets feedback about how their body is performing. Our profession is ridiculous when it comes to this stuff. If you don’t want to use it then don’t, but don’t go telling other not to do it because it does provide beneficial information when used in the grand scheme of an evaluation. I wouldn’t stop using them Janell Klosterman to influence your exam findings, but may choose to use other measures for goal setting based on insurance practices

I’m doing research on red light therapy, have never used it, debating if I want to add that to my mobile practice. A chiropractor I met sent me this link. Does anyone know about these products at this website? They claim to use a different technology than traditional red light therapy.  Has anyone had success with red light therapy for mobile use? TIA


**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use it and love it. I actually have really good reviews from patients on it. My mom broke her wrist and had an ORIF last year. She can't take pain meds and she pretty much wore my vibe constantly and it was the only thing that helped her pain.

"$500k/year" 

That's what someone just told me they had sitting there unbilled or clients that are being turned away because they can't find qualified therapists.  

First- it's amazing what our clients are accomplishing in their practices that this is what's waiting in referrals and being turned away. 

But more importantly than that, it gave me an opportunity to talk about something I've been noticing a lot recently. 

Many people and potential clients of Uncaged only want to talk about how to grow a business and how to make $$$$ in a practice. They LOVE talking about the ENGINE of a business but very rarely talk about the BRAKES of a business. 

Are brakes sexy? no. It's way cooler to talk about how many horsepower a car has 

But one of the quickest way to derail your practice/business is to sacrifice the quality of care, delivery, and boundaries. 

Don't build a business that is all horsepower and no stopping power.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Amen! I’ve found my business really flourishes when I say no to the opportunities that don’t feel right but have $$$ potential and yes to the opportunities that resonate with how I want to practice as a clinician. Takes guts and faith to trust the process.

> **Response 2:** Turning business away is hard. Often we hold on to it too closely and when we tell people "no" we feel that we're letting them down. 

I still have to untangle from this in a non-clinical role... and I was REALLY wound up in it while working clinically. (Mostly because if I said no, they had to drive for hours to find another OT... which sucks.) 

But you're SO RIGHT that when we focus on our areas of strength and pass on the opportunities that are outside of our zone -- we do more good and impact more lives in the long run. 

I've been leaning into this more this year and every time I say "I need to pass this project to someone else" I cringe, but it allows me to stay in my zone and find the best fit clients. 🙂

Need some advice. I’m starting up my mobile cash-pay practice this week. I had four clients scheduled to eval on Friday. One of them had contacted me by phone several weeks ago to get on the schedule, and I had asked her if she had checked out the website for information, and she said she did and agreed to schedule. I didn’t specifically mention the cash-pay piece because it’s on the website, so I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, assuming she had seen that part. Fast forward to this week. She completed the intake paperwork, and one of the consents that she had to agree to was the payment policy which SPECIFICALLY states it is cash pay and that I do not bill insurance. Today I had an email from her asking where she can upload her insurance information on the portal. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I responded that my practice is cash pay and that I don’t submit anything to her insurance but that I can provide a superbill for her to apply for out of network benefits. She responded and said she had misunderstood and that she wanted to use a practice that will take her insurance. I emailed her back some information and explanation, but I understand her decision.

So all that to say, do any of you have kind of a script in your head to have that conversation with patients when they want to schedule with you? I shouldn’t just assume that they know it is cash-pay, and I want to handle it tactfully.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always do an intake call, and always say “just so you know, we don’t take insurance. But many of my clients submit claims on their own for out of network reimbursement. If that’s something you’d like to do, I’m happy to provide you with the paperwork after each session.” Then I tell them my prices.

> **Response 2:** I’ve found it’s easier to assume they missed something critical even if they have looked me up. I also schedule an initial call with every new patient to gather basic info and enter them into my system, during this call i have a written template I pull out, which prompts me to ask for all the proper details and discuss all topics I need to ensure folks understand, so i know they’re cool with everything before I even do the work of sending a welcome email and intake paperwork. 

I collect the usual name DOB address, contact info etc. Topics I go over include my pricing and out of network status, pet policy, and at one time my mask policy since I live in the south and using masks were a dealbreaker for some patients. I usually ask about entrances/ stairs so I know what to expect.

Nothing annoyed me more than wasting a bunch of time getting everything set up, just to have them cancel last minute over something I could have spent three seconds pointing out in the intake call to double check, so I set it up this way and I highly recommend!

Hello! I am a mobile PT in central Wisconsin looking for advice from other mobile PTs on a vehicle they would recommend or don't recommend for the job?

Does anyone lease?

I currently have a 2017 Jeep Cherokee Limited with about 180k miles on it. Love it but have heard some issues with the newer ones.

My problem is my vehicle has been in the shop too many times with issues that it's now impacting business too often and costing me more money to have a rental since it takes weeks to get in and at least a week to fix. I'd like to fix this one as a back up but have a more reliable one.

Thank you!
Amanda

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 163k miles on my 2008 Toyota 4Runner. I’ve owned it for 5 years now and turned in a 2013 Volkswagen Passat for it (absolute lemon of a car)

I’ll always be a Toyota fan! Never any problems and fixes are cheap and easy to handle. Most reliable cars and trucks on the market

> **Response 2:** My 2015 crv is at 300k and traded it to a new crv and gave it to my daughter. Then bought a little Honda civic 2017 at 160k running strong. Mileage is mileage. It's how you take care of it my friend. Good luck!!!

Back pain post work out gives the impression you are seeking young active patients . Geriatric patients could be big clients of yours .

> **Response 2:** try  "Has your back pain increased since starting your workouts" or ...since you started to workout"

 "I am a mobile physical therapist offering one on one care in your home"

lastly you offer "an hour" not "a" hour

Revenue will likely see another 25-30% growth for 2024.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Awesome, how is your patient-staffing ratio? Would you mind sharing ratio of clinicians to support staff? Daily-weekly productivity stds? Billing in-house?

I'm considering doing hybrid as well but not sure how to go about starting out since I'm not currently affiliated with any Medicare or commercial insurance. Struggling with leads as a solely cash Mobile practice.

What certifications and extra training has resulted in the biggest ROI for all you cash based peeps?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Short answer:
Dry Needling & any Pelvic Floor knowledge.

Long answer:
Learning about whatever I’m most passionate about — in formal and informal ways.  Me being excited & having solutions for my clients is more important than any single certification. 

Mentorships — informal from colleagues & formal online programs. 

Getting treatment from a wide variety of other providers.  Even a bad massage  has lessons to be learned. 

Manual therapy — if people like the quality of your touch, you’re gold.

I only dry needle ~50% of the people who specifically book asking for DN. Often they are relieved it’s optional.  

But yes, I do think DN is a good skill for cash PT — unless you can adequately compensate with other strengths.   

The more I learn about Pelvic Floor the more effective my sessions are.   Much more powerful than DN.   I only do external PF and it’s still been a game changer.  (Well PF Dry needling is great too!)

> **Response 2:** manual therapy cert.....the skills, not the extra letters.......and its not even close

**Original Post:**
The first thing I noticed was all of the ice plunges…

So, I’ve deliberately tried hard to spend less time on social media lately, both posting and consuming…

A little bit of margin from it, made something abundantly clear to me.

When you scroll through social media land, I’m struck by the amount of posts and stories about people’s daily lives, their morning routines, ice plunges, workouts they do, things they eat, etc. 

We cover it with a noble facade of “I’m motivating others around me.”, but I believe it reveals something much deeper…

It reveals that this generation is constantly looking to be validated by our peers and by the world. An outward facade of “I’m trying to motivate others” is actually covering up an inward feeling of “I want others to think I’m special”.

I’m not being mean, just truthful. I promise this ends very positively. 

But think about it - Men, who want SO badly to be “hard” and to be seen as men, because they were never told by their Fathers that they are…
- Post nonstop about their workouts
- Their ice plunges
- Their discipline that they want to show the world.

The problem is: True resilience and strength will actually come if that same man, would stop looking for validation from the world, and continue with their routines in silence.

Just them, and their routines, doing it for the betterment of themselves, the betterment of themselves as a Father, and as a husband. Without a need to post it. Constantly seeking validation from others is actually what’s stopping this generation from truly growing internally as men and women…

And the ultimate problem is this: You are already worthy. You have been made in the image of Christ. You have nothing to prove and everything to gain from seeing that your true identity is as a beloved son and daughter of Christ.

So, let’s put our phones down. Let’s stop looking for validation from the world, and start looking toward our Father in Heaven. The world will never give you what only the Father can.

The best growth comes when all of those things are done in the secret place, without any “want” or “need” in you to post it for others to see. But, only for your Father in Heaven to see. It will free your soul.

If patients are willing to pay $500-$700 dollars a visit does that mean I should? At what point is it a ripoff?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t understand the question. 

Are you asking if you should charge $500-$700 a visit for PT? If so then heck yes! 

Are you asking if you should pay $500 to $700 a visit for PT? If so then Heck no! You already paid $100k+ in education. Just do it yourself🤣

> **Response 2:** Impossible to narrow down to a range because it’s subjective. I think buying a new sports car is a rip off cuz I don’t care about cars at all….but other people find that a great use of their money. 

Don’t put yourselves in other people’s wallets. You just tell them the benefits of working with you, and if you position it well and they see the benefit, they will pay whatever you’re charging.

Good morning fellow practitioners! I’m a PTA and have been considering going back to school to do my DPT and I have 2 questions: 

1) any schools you suggest that either has a bridge program or a hybrid program that most of program can be done online? 

2) is it worth going back for? 

I’m fully open to any suggestions or advice anyone has! 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would encourage anyone and everyone not to go into PT until direct access is fully granted, and reimbursement increases significantly.  The tuition cost and time commitment to become a PT is definitely not worth the pay and grueling hours.

> **Response 2:** Not worth it. For what you pay in tuition (student loans) will not be comparable to your salary which is less and less each year. If I had to do it over, I’d taken the PA route.

I wouldn't trade this 🎠 ride for anything right now.

But I also wouldn't have gotten on it in the first place without knowing I'd have support to get through the lows. The coaching from Kevin DeGroot , Josh Payne and David Bayliff in their Pathway program does exactly that. (And it helps make those peaks and valleys not quite so extreme.)

Keep climbing, y'all. Keep building what you're meant to build.

**Original Post:**
Update: thank you everyone for the feedback. After your feedback I sent an invoice via certified mail (so they couldn’t say they didn’t receive it). I also sent them a message letting them know I was cancelling their next appointment as I hadn’t heard from them, that the equipment needed to be returned by the end of this coming week (they could just leave it in a bag by the office door) and that if it wasn’t returned and the outstanding balance wasn’t paid I would be going to the PD for theft of the equipment and moving forward with filing against them in small claims court.  That was enough for them to resume communications. 

They’ve agreed in writing to return the equipment. I’m hopeful I’ll get paid too. They did send a vague threat of negative review which will suck if that happens.  I’m still glad I took actions to hold my boundary instead of just letting it go.  

Any 100% private pay providers ever have a patient steal a session? Does anyone know what channels I have for recourse? I’m in NH if that makes a difference. 

This is a first for me in 11 years. 
I usually make sure people have a credit card on file. In fact my system requires one to book an appointment online but every now and then I’ll schedule a new patient over the phone and forget to get a card.  Still nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

The patient in question came in for an eval. I verbally told them on the phone when they scheduled that I don’t take insurance and my price. They also got an email with the appointment confirmation stating that I don’t take insurance.  They signed 2 forms before the appointment stating that I don’t take insurance and they are responsible for payment at the time of service.  

We get to the end of a 2.5 hour eval (I specialize in PTSD and chronic/complex issues) and when I asked what card they’d like to use they told me to bill insurance.  When I reminded them I don’t take insurance they told me they lost their wallet.  I asked about Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, etc and they said they don’t have any of those.  

I sent them an invoice through email hoping they would pay it.  We actually communicated by text for about 4 days after the appointment so I was hopeful that maybe they would actually pay.  It’s been over 2 weeks now and I’m being ghosted.  No response via phone, email, or text anymore.

If it makes a difference I also loaned them a piece of my equipment to use and then bring back at their next session. I’m kicking myself for not getting my equipment back once they asked me to bill insurance and said they lost their wallet.  I just got so flustered and was late for my next patient that I couldn’t get the words out.  So I also need to either get my equipment back or charge them to replace it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Honestly for one time I'd eat the cost to avoid the stress and cost of the collections/court.  I had one patient that acknowledged the cost of a 20% coinsurance, signed papers, then refused to pay and it carried on. It was around the holidays last year and was somewhere between $100-200 due. She was very chronic and had some mental involvement with ptsd and a lot of ups and downs. Treatment was going great and then it was like she snapped about all kinds of things and said her psychiatrist wrote off her private due charges. I said it was illegal for me to write off insurance agreements.  In agreement with my insurance assistant, I ultimately wrote it off that one time as "uncollectable" instead of taking her to small claims after trying many times to collect payment. I called the referring doctor and discussed the situation as well. I was upset about it for a little while but the continuation of pressing further wasn't worth it. 

With the equipment...it depends. Sorry you had that experience. Patient avoidance behavior is really tough. I agree on pay before.

> **Response 2:** I had this happen once. The eval was 1.5 hours and super complicated guy and he kept complaining that my table wasn’t padded enough. Then-said to invoice him-which I did and he didn’t pay. When I  reached out he was angry about the table and the fact that I asked him questions about what he wanted to do but could not do due to his injury (a subjective interview!!) and threatened to report me to the board. 

While the board report wouldn’t have mattered since I didn’t do anything wrong-it was still something I really didn’t want to go thru. 

I just let the payment go. I try to reflect back and see if I missed red flags w him 🚩 

Hope karma does its job!

Hello there! I want to be uncaged but currently don’t have the brain power or time to do so…  (mom of a 3 yo and 9 month twins). Can someone shed some light on the whole “you can’t provide therapy services under cash pay because they’re billable to Medicare” thing? Do I have that concept wrong? I see people offering “wellness” rather than therapy. 

If the above is how it works, aren’t you by default not providing skilled therapy covered by Medicare if you’re not documenting your services? There is no skill of a therapist if there is no documented skill of a therapist, and no physician signed POC right? What am I missing here or do I have it all wrong? 

Thanks for helping me out if you can. I have a few clients in home health that told me they’d hire me if I started my own practice, but there is absolutely so much I don’t know and I don’t have the time to figure it all out 😅 I’ve just been lurking in here trying to slowly glean information and wrap my head around this concept. Thanks 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great question Veronica Erlenbush, and let’s get some clarity here. The reason why most PT’s say that you cannot charge cash for Medicare beneficiaries is due to the Meidcare Mandatory Claims Submission Rule. Meaning, if it is skilled PT that Medicare covers, it is mandatory that we submit a claim. Where it gets tricky, is if you have literally no relationship with Medicare, there is no way for you to submit a claim. Here is where it gets confusing: If there is no way to technically submit a claim online, but it’s still mandatory for you to do it as a non-participating provider……you can now understand why this is talked about so much lol. Here is where I can give you clarity: Medicare does define wellness as essentially skilled care for the patient. So, if it is unskilled like simple strengthening and endurance, technically that is NOT covered UNLESS a pre-qualifying injury or hospitalization takes place. See where I’m going here? So, if a Medicare aged client is seeking you out for general strengthening and well-being and they aren’t being treated for a specific injury or disorder, you can have them sign a Medicare beneficiary form decided under their own free will to pay you out-of-pocket for wellness services.

I know it’s a mess. Honestly, I’m with PT’s who have battled this and called it unconstitutional. They have created a monopoly essentially. 

I believe the only true loophole left, is if they are truly wellness (which the funny thing is that’s about 90% of HH clients I have seen after they have been discharged from therapy). Then, as long as they are deciding under their own free will because they want to get stronger and pay you, technically they can.

You just have to be okay with some physical therapists saying it’s “risky”. I believe Medicare has struck immense levels of fear into our profession to try to make sure they keep their monopoly in place.

But, if a Medicare aged client who doesn’t need skilled therapy comes to me and wants to get stronger to age better, I’ll see them 10 out of 10 times.

> **Response 2:** As a parent, I'll give you parent version.  You can't take cash from medicare patient for what would be something medicare pays for.  If you a rehabbing a post op knee, can't do it, but if you are keeping them from having pain while playing golf (not a covered service by Medicare) you can.

Hi everyone! I started my mobile cash based pelvic floor PT practice about 2 months ago. After going to countless doctors, I'm realizing this is not the best way to market. However, I haven't been successful yet and was wondering what people did for marketing/battling the "if I have insurance why should I pay cash" ideology. 

I have posted on some moms groups in the area and made an Instagram account that I post in a couple times a week. 

Any insight would be super helpful! TIA!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dont brand or sell yourself as PT to customers bc they may associate that with insurance

Just call yourself the Vagina Wizard or something and watch the clients roll in

Im half kidding half serious about the name, but you might get my gist

> **Response 2:** I have the same business model as well. I helped organize a local "women's health providers/fitness instructors" lunch meet up where we had doulas, midwives, Pilates instructors, personal trainers. stroller fitness teachers, etc. we have a great referral network with eachother . I also have a working relationship with the local OBs and pediatricians. Also- other concierge medicine providers are great referral sources. I also have a small instagram account I started just as my virtual business card and friended only local moms and local business owners instead of trying to market to the masses on social media (I rarely post but it's just so people can get some visuals)

Hi Everyone! I am so grateful for this community for keeping the vision alive and the passion in my heart. 

I left my outpatient job earlier this year and when initially meeting with an attorney was told my non-compete most likely wasn’t valid and that if I was providing mobile cash services (that my previous company didn’t offer) I wouldn’t have to worry about my non compete at all. I went ahead and started the bootcamp course, established an LLC and the early steps of beginning my business. Then when I met with him again he had oddly flipped his advice and said after further review he felt it was completely valid and I should just lay low for the 18 month non compete term. I feel SO stuck. I have multiple people reaching out for services and I am terrified to move forward. I have a good relationship with my previous employer and told them my intention’s. It’s a company with 3 owners, two of which I directly worked with and know well. The third was relatively removed and not the friendliest individual. My direct boss even offered to mentor me and share his business journey. BUT something in my gut is telling me to tread carefully because I don’t entirely trust they wouldn’t pursue something if I completely disregarded the non compete. The attorney’s recommendation was to save any profits I make if they do decide to pursue litigation. I have seen a few people cash pay but now I feel as if I shouldn’t. I took a job at a local facility for the time being and I even had a previous patient contact me at my new job asking for services. I feel like it’s such a disservice to my previous clients to just “lay low” for 18 months but I really don’t want to end up in litigation. 

What are other peoples experiences with these types of situations? If I do wait the full 18 months what courses, resources, or readings would you recommend I work on in the mean time to be ready to hit the ground running when the time is right? 

Sorry for the rant! I’m reviewing the boot camp course again today and feel so torn on how to move forward. I miss my patients and I just have so many ideas I can’t wait to explore. 18 months feels like an eternity but I know it’s not the end of the world.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Mobile. Set your office address outside the milage of the non compete. Simple.

> **Response 2:** Most non-competes for our type of work won’t stand up in court. I would continue on

I take a patient's initial subjective history as it comes. My sentences are choppy, out of order, and often have typos. The story is there, but I wouldn't want to be the one who has to read it. 😂

Presto. A few tweaks, and it sounds significantly cleaner and more professional.

**Community Responses:**

I talked one of my previous patients into continuing on a cash basis since she has a high deductible anyway. Something to think about.

  Personally, I have chronic low back pain.  I will get on the table with the light for 20min in pain and have zero pain when I get off.   It’s extremely relaxing.   I was not expecting instant results but more benefits after routine sessions.  It was immediate results in my case.  
We have people use it for skin dermatitis, psoriasis with improved symptoms within 2-3 sessions.   I want to test it on neuropathy patients.

I have a Biomax panel and a stand that tilts horizontally so I can roll it on top of patient treatment areas with better proximity to the body.

> **Response 2:** I use a red light during session and if patient wants one I direct them in where to purchase. Very relaxing. I recommend reading and researching it more. It can be great for pain and inflammation.

I know this topic has been covered before BUT I had someone approach me about seeing their mother for PT. Her mother is on medicare. She and her mother would prefer to see me over an in-network provider but I told her I am not comfortable seeing medicare patients because of legality questions. Now I'm questioning the grey area of can we, as cash-based PTs, see medicare patients for PT? I have avoided medicare patients entirely thus far but would like more information. Can anyone give me a more solid answer on the rules for treatment of medicare patients as an out-of-network provider? Does anyone have a good healthcare lawyer in Massachusetts that they can refer me to so that I can answer more of these types of questions myself?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t see why this is even an issue. You aren’t defrauding anyone, the patient is making their own choice to see you and  use their own money. What is best for the patient trumps anything else in my opinion.

> **Response 2:** This rule applies if it is a covered service by Medicare. Medicare only covers “medically necessary services”. If you can justify that you’re seeing her for something that is not exactly medically necessary you should be fine. 

I would also argue that no one really cares. Medicare isn’t going to come for you and say “you should have taken our money, not the patients.” But that’s just a risk you would have to be comfortable taking if you do think it’s a covered skilled service and can’t argue otherwise.

**Community Responses:**

I sometimes had a table to use and sometimes not. When I found a location to settle in, the first modality I purchased was the Dolphin MPS Neurostimulator and this is a requested modality and people will pay out of pocket. No one has ever requested Heat, US, or estim.

Hello all.

Im doing homecare PT for Medicare part B patients in NY and I make 62.5$/hour plus all the benefits. 

Ive noticed that the company i work for gets reimbursed about 200-220$/(empire) visit which makes me want to open my own company and work on marketing myself if this is the reimbursement rate. Why shouldn’t i do this? 

Having to see less patients and having more time for myself would be great. Please let me know What are your input from those who have done the same:

Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There is no way they make that for 4 unit treatments for Medicare. They may bill that. Steven Glukh is in NY he can give his thoughts.

> **Response 2:** Pretty certain you are looking at what was billed. Example, I operate my private practice and I bill $60 per 15 minute unit for Part B mobile outpatient. That comes out to $240 billed for 4 units/1hour. After payment we are looking at $100-$108 actually received. Add in the cost of EMR, liability insurance, marketing, billing, book keeping, etc that $100 becomes a lot less real quick. Add in a 3.4% decrease in CPT codes reimbursement for 2024 and I average a $5 decrease for 2024 reimbursement per hour. Depending on what I bill for. As an owner you are taking 100% risk and when you come home from seeing patients you are wearing all of the hats. You are also risking that something was billed incorrectly and you are not getting paid. Consider that above and if you are willing to proceed go for it! Owning your own biz is the way to go! I love what I do! 

If you are talking Home health part A. That's a bit more complex, as you have to adjust for community/institution, complexity, and patient diagnosis. Two 30 day periods and how it's reimbursed differently for every patient admitted.

For those who moved into mobile outpatient… what are the top 3-4 items you use now that you initially didn’t expect to when you first started… and what are the few that you did purchase that you get a lot less use of than you thought?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I work in the neuro/geriatric realm, I love my yoga block. It acts as a hurdle, a small step to work on SL weightbearing, an item to reach for, a cone to walk around, a non-threatening item to practice form before loading functional patterns like squats.

> **Response 2:** Not sure where you are located, but now I have each patient buy what they need so that it could be in their home. I don’t carry anything￼

If you are a mobile PT who brings a portable table with you and it fits in the trunk of your vehicle, what kind of vehicle do you drive?  After a year of making it work, I need a vehicle that can fit my table in the trunk so I don’t have to put it in the back seat where my kids sit!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Toyota RAV4 Hybrid
Which I bought almost a year ago and LOVE the gas mileage and that I fill up every 2-3 weeks).  But for your concerns, before my RAV4, I had a Subaru Outback and my table easily fit in there as well.

> **Response 2:** VW Atlas. The table fits perfectly & can still fit in a double jogging stroller in 3rd row with 2 kids in carseats in the 2nd row.

You got into this profession for a reason. It wasn't easy to get through school. It wasn't easy to make the sacrifices that you made but you still did it for a reason. 

Then you got jaded. A bad boss, frustrating work experience, etc put you in a position that you felt burnt out. 

Now you're searching for how to fix the burn out and you're incessantly marketed to that MONEY is going to solve your problem. 

It won't.

It might be a salve on the pain for a bit but that isn't going to get you back to why you did what you did in the first place. Why you made all the sacrifices and did all the work. 

Businesses should be created so you can reengage with the why and passion you had for loving, serving, caring for and leading other in the first place. Not so you can get over your jaded attitude by making more money.

**Community Responses:**

PSA that Luna Physical Therapy is not your friend. When you work with them, keep your eyes wide open on what their mission is. They are prioritizing hospital based outpatient therapy and hospital systems vs indpendeant PT practices. The business model has evolved since I worked with them early on. At first they were the anti-hospital establishment, lower cost alternative for the little guy and partnered with indpendent PT practices to expand reach. Now they are blatantly assisting hospitals in "fixing their leakage" problem by keeping patients away from independent PT practices and scrapped their entire initial mission of making physical therapists more independent and less reliant on hospital systems. If you sign up with Luna to do some stuff on the side, just be aware they and you by proxy will be working against your own interest of building an independent PT practice. They are now in the business of doing the hospital system's bidding.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not a single mention of patient outcomes or satisfaction, financial impact on the PATIENT, or how it can benefit patients to go outside of the hospital system. Yikes. Don’t get me wrong, hospitals need to stay in business - especially those in rural communities - but this is just propaganda.

> **Response 2:** Can’t you just transition the Luna patients to a wellness program for cash?

OK, are you brainiacs out there? Figure this one out

Wednesday  afternoon

slipped on let’s just say a banana peel not sure what it was. I did not fall. I did not have any impact. I caught myself and my final position of my leg when I caught myself was foot flat,  knee to about 50 degrees , flexion internal rotation of the hip and adduction of the hip 

For several days, I’ve had super patella swelling , some point tenderness around the fibular head and on the femorsl condyle  anterio-lateral. 

This morning I wake up with bruising on my fibular head , on the lateral tibia proximal  right next to the fibrillar head and on the femoral condo, not on the patella  and a smaller lighter bruise on the medial tibia condyle

I’ve had difficulty with weight-bearing until it gets warmed up and then I have no problem with flexion extension weight-bearing just pivoting. I have no trouble at all doing quad sets since the beginning!

Can go up on left tiptoes no problem

This swelling in half what it was

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No pain ascending stairs

Descending discomfort at full flexion..likely swelling

> **Response 2:** I am now 48 hours past injury and the only symptom I’m having is discomfort in the femoral head 
where the bruise is so I’m beginning to think that I have a tear in ant-superior 
Tibiofibular ligament which interestingly enough is where the most bruising is even though it’s already discolored and Brown, after only 40 hours

Still some supra patellar swelling, but it’s going down significantly every day and quad contraction of any kind doesn’t set off any symptom

First, please tell me I can do this. I’m terrified! 😬
And second, through whom do you all have your disability insurance. I see that HPSO has a plan. That’s who my malpractice is through. Your opinions are greatly appreciated. 🙏🙌🏼💪

**Community Responses:**

As I’ve made more money and been around people who make a lot of money I feel it’s important to remind people that the people who make a ton of money have the same core problems you do. Yet so often we chase money as though it’ll fix root issues in our mindset, families, friendships, health, faith, etc 

Please don’t fall victim to that belief.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dropping bombs 💣

> **Response 2:** Bravo. I cringe occasionally at the “prosperity gospel” messaging I see in this group, and others, online. And I would like to add a perspective “from the other side” if you will: after working in the PT industry for years, in the 90s i had gone back to school for a post-professional doctorate and opened a private practice. Huge success, dreams coming true left and right, then in spring 2001 my life partner was diagnosed with cancer. He died two weeks after 9/11. And suddenly none of that success meant anything. There was NO amount of money that could have kept him with me, and I would have paid ANY amount of money for just 5 more minutes. And not a single minute of all of those weeks, months, years of spending 50,60,70+ hours/week working, studying, away from home could be reclaimed. I was 38yo! Please be mindful about what you wish for. Honor the sacrifices you (and by default your loved ones) are making to achieve your wishes. And make choices so that you have no regrets later…no matter the outcome.

Incoming gushy post.. 😅 So I'm about to celebrate my 2nd year as an independent and UNCAGED CLINICIAN  and I can't help but feel a huge sense of gratitude. ❤️

I took a completely different approach to freedom and decided to serve blue collar workers in the industrial field. I have been in this field for 5 years now and have had more success than I could have dreamed of. 

Thank goodness for the support of family, friends, other therapists, and sites like this. What a wild, nerve racking, and crazy ride. 💯

Is it kosher to be contracted with Medicare part B, but choose to not contract with all the Medicare HMO Advantage plans and just charge cash for those patients?  I'm ok with straight up Medicare, but all the Advantage plans are giving me reflux. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

Long rant. Feeling a bit down. Love working for ourselves rather than someone else. But I am in a mental rut. Like big time. There is a never ending list of things to do/get caught up on and I feel I'm just tredding water (i want to be in a place where i have maybe 1 or 2 PTs at most working with us and not just status quo). Once we get systems in place and all the dust settles from switching documentation systems from January, I hope things improve.

But what do you all do to stay focused and motivated?! All the small random tasks that keep holding us back are just so daunting. 

The funny thing is when we worked for someone else, we basically did EVERYTHING we currently do.....so I thought it would be a quick transition. But it's such a struggle to get ahold of our new setup with no true systems in place. I literally cannot focus on getting my notes done because all I can think of is the back end of things with all the tasks that need to get done. 

Sorry for the long post....but gah! We are coming up on our 3rd anniversary in September and truly thought we would be in a better spot in general (not necessarily financially) just with workflow and growth

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Well 😂😂 as long as your business partner doesn’t steal the bank and run off … I’m betting you got this.

Got good advice once in 1971…keep your brain where your feet are and to thine own self be true

And after 53+ years as a PT I still use it every day

**Community Responses:**

It just depends 

If you need some strategy and support and love an artist, I think it’s worth whatever it costs 

I don’t personally care that much about my logo and has that made on fiver 

I’ve worked with artists on graphics I really cared about and spent a few hundred dollars each graphic

I’m seriously considering leaving the hospital setting and starting my own practice by myself. I’m hesitant to do it because of all the energy and time starting a new company takes with small kids at home. I feel I don’t have much more time or energy to give to something else but I want a change in schedule and more flexibility. I’m a person that needs to know numbers. How do I find out what the private practice- self employed (1 clinician) makes in a year and how many hours they work?  And have this related to my geographic location? I need a comparison locally. Also need to look at other benefits- what does insurance cost and where would you go through for medical benefits as I would loose good medica benefits, PTO, retirement matching, etc.
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am currently starting my own mobile outpatient practice. Been working on it since about May of this year, and just launched my website last weekend looking to start taking patients in January. My kids are 3, 5, and 6. I did the uncaged boot camp classes in the evenings, and I took a course to become certified in my specialty by waking up at 5am to do the coursework while everyone else slept. I developed my own website in the evenings or on weekends until it was ready to launch, and now I don’t have to mess with it. My sister also started her own mobile outpatient practice with four kids at home. It’s definitely do-able, but you have to look at how you’re spending your time and give yourself grace to develop it slowly if it’s really what’s best for your family life. In the meantime, I still work full time in home health. If you went just PRN with a HH agency, you would probably have better pay and more flexibility. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** When my kids were little I really enjoyed working PRN,  because when I was working I could focus on work but when I came home I was present for them. 

Now that they are a bit older I recently started my own mobile PT practice. Not gonna lie, I feel like it was a lot of work to get everything in place. But I'm a bit OCD lol...This might just be me but when my kids were little I would not have wanted that responsibility. The other thing is I don't need the benefits as my husband's are good.

Pay in my area...outpt PRN 40ish per hour, Home Health PRN 55-60 per visit plus wear and tear on your car. A lot more paperwork especially if you have to do start of cares, I find they are not worth it being PRN.

If you can find somewhere that does mobile outpatient PT in the home much easier on paperwork. 55 a visit in my area. The best way to do this is to sign on with a few companies and keep your area very  very small. Drive time is everything. 

For reference with Medicare and the supplement I get about 105 a visit, with my mobile PT practice and I am doing my own billing and pay for my own equipment car,  gas, all that. But look at the pay difference...I feel like it's worth doing it on my own. 105 vs 55...no brainer.
Another good option if you're not ready to take the leap is look into Luna in my area they pay about 70 a visit mobile outpatient PT in the home. I know people give them a lot of shade but I love working for them too. I'm an independent contractor with them so they help fill in my schedule a bit. Plus guaranteed pay on the spot
Super easy paperwork and you can just focus on treating.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have more questions

This question comes up often here. Our health insurance is going up again this year and we pay for everything anyway bc of a high deductible. Who has switched to Healthshare and can share their experience positive and negative. I am about to make the jump but want to hear from some people who have switched. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Zion healthshare and absolutely love it. Their customer service is amazing. I am actually dealing with a whole cancer situation that required genetic testing (that they normally wouldn’t cover but did), and will be having surgery in a few weeks—once i paid my $1000 deductible every single thing has been covered and I don’t have to pay out of pocket, they send me a virtual credit card. 

The process of saying you’re self pay and getting itemized receipts takes a second to get used to but I haven’t had any issues getting reimbursed or challenges getting care.

> **Response 2:** Ok now I’d like to know, do these health share companies cover prosthetics? My prosthetuc leg was $89,000. It’s out of warranty and broke.  I got a charitable organization to pay the $12,000 repair bill, but I’ll eventually need a new one and could really use a new socket (about $10k for that).

Do one thing differently!!! 
For my mobile patients…. Anyone that’s a senior, disabled or a veteran I run their property tax exemptions if they own their home. This person missed two exemptions for the past five years. Their property taxes are lowered now by $700 a year and they got this refund. ￼ checking this takes me about five minutes a person and I couldn’t pay for advertising with this kind of effect. #ThinkOutsideTheBox 🎁

**Community Responses:**

I think I've seen you post about this previously. Is this a federal thing? Or your state and/or county exemption?

To recertify a board-specialty…or not?

I would love some discussion from the hive mind to help me mentally work through this. 

I have a board specialty, and am proud of the hard work that went into obtaining it years ago, but beyond the initial boost in knowledge in my specialty area, I can’t say that I see it continue to pay off. 

I can think of LESS than a handful of clients in those years who said they found me because of the specialty or because someone recommended them to me because of the specialty. I can think of no referral sources who place it above location, reputation and relationship.

The costs are kind of outrageous. Over a 10 year MOSC cycle, $760 in MOSC fees. $470 each time for an every-3-yr required course, and an extra $200 in supplies if you don’t have them. $180 for an application review at the 10 yr mark, and $810 to sit for the recertification exam at the 10 yr mark (provided you’re an APTA member). That works out to  $3300 over 10 years. Just to have it!

This is having shades of a “sunk cost” fallacy.

New grads come out, have a good argument about their schooling costing more and inflation and salaries doing what they do, and can start not far from where an established clinician with a board specialty costs. The board specialty becomes a non-factor as a bargaining chip for salary and pay discussions. 

Has anybody had similar thoughts or experiences? Has anybody decided, for themselves, to recertify? Why? Has anybody here decided NOT to recertify? Why?

Any help and discussion as I mentally work through it would be so welcomed!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you all so much for your input on this. Seems like many of you have reached the same conclusion I’m feeling but not ready to fully accept yet. This is unfortunate, and more unfortunate that board specialties are still promoted like they are as a gateway to career advancement, increased pay, etc.

> **Response 2:** All these are namesake nomenclature with zero financial benefits.... if you are a employee or employer in our field of practice ... the bottom for reimbursement is license to practice... 
Any PT can be equally knowledgeable academically without getting this certificates and still treat patients.... 

All these certificate BS is created by our lovely APTA to make money for themselves and those CEU companies .... as I was taught All this manual certification courses at my university while pursuing my masters and it is listed on the course syllabus...

As they say Doctors "Practice".... and everyone knows "practice make man perfect".

Welcome to stupidity in healthcare. 147 claims (I have yet to be paid THIS YEAR) from the state telling me I forgot GP on each claim.  Well that’s healthcare dollars well spent. 441 pieces of paper, ink, 147 envelopes and postage.  All could have been resolved with one phone call.

🔥I just got a pelvic floor referral from a large OB/Gyn practice. The pressure is real! I need to do extremely well with this patient. 

After taking multiple pelvic rehab courses I’ve been unable to break into the pelvic health setting except for one patient who decided to give me a shot, and now they are my biggest cheerleader. This could be huge with helping me develop my skills as a provider and scaling my practice with this niche. 

I can’t believe I’m starting to reap the fruits of my labor. 

God is good ya’ll! Keep grinding and good things will come!

**Original Post:**
Is anyone using red light therapy beds in their practice? 

We’ve had multiple inquires about it recently as there is no one in our geographical area offering it so we’ve star￼ted to research it more. 

What are you marketing it for: pain/inflammation relief, neuropathy, sports recovery, body contouring & weight loss?

What kind of results are your patients/clients achieving with it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a Pelvic Health PT, I use an inter-vaginal red light device to promote increased self-lubrication and decreased pain. This is really important during peri-menopause and while breastfeeding since estrogen levels decrease (this can lead to a lot of dryness in the vaginal canal). Usually topical estrogen creams are the go-to intervention for vaginal dryness, but many of my clients prefer the red light because there is no risk of chemical SE and they like the idea of not using synthetic hormones. My clients are huge fans and see results within a few weeks using red light! 

Other than using red light inter-vaginally, I don’t currently have any panels or beds in my clinic. I personally use a Joov red light panel every morning that I meditate in front of. 

My dad become very curious about red light therapy for athletic recovery after hearing that many collegiate football teams have installed red light rooms in their locker rooms! This was a big selling point for him and he now purchased his own red light panels to use at home. 

Since red light targets the mitochondria of the cells it contacts and increased cellular output/function, it helps to optimize most body systems. Because it can be so broadly used, I would inquire into what exact uses your clients are looking to use it for and perhaps design your marketing around that!

> **Response 2:** I don’t have a bed, but I have several pads that I use. I advertise it for pain control and tissue mobilization at a cellular level. My clients really like it. My mom used a pad for 10 min after having knee pain for weeks and walked away with zero pain, and I did nothing else to her knee.

Hello, everyone! 
Looking for help! 

DPT and first time mom here! I’m in the middle of my maternity leave and the idea of having to go back to work and leave my baby girl is daunting! I’ve always toyed with the idea of starting a mobile cash-based practice but chicken out everytime! I took a Herman & Wallace Pelvic Health course last summer and never got to use anything I learned. I’m seriously considering attempting to get something mobile started now and would like my focus to be on pregnant and postpartum mothers. I haven’t taken any classes on pregnancy but would love to. I’m not able to do this fill time but could start slow and see where it takes me. What is the reality that something like this could work? Mobile cash-based pregnant/postpartum patients. Any insight is more than welcome. Can anyone weigh in on this? I’m so over working for other people and would love to give my girl all of the attention she needs! Thank you!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d say this is definitely doable but don’t just fall for the fantasy of how great it sounds. It CAN be, but after a lot of work, even if you plan to start slowly. There will be a lot of work to go into starting a business you won’t know about til you start, even slow/part time. I did this coming back from my first mat leave and I have no regrets, but wish someone painted a realistic picture for me. It was way more work and is now the flexible venture I wanted. The end goal of working part time and being with my kiddo was possible, but the work to get it going wasn’t as simple or “part time” as I thought. I would much rather work hard for myself than someone else, but just want you to have a realistic view of what it entails. 

I also think you’ll need to take more coursework to adequately treat this population as a solo provider without mentorship. 

I’d also recommend the Business Accelerator course through Pelvic PT Rising. It’s an investment that will save you a lot of headaches and mistakes as you launch!

> **Response 2:** Definitely doable but don’t get confused, it’s not “less work” or less time.

Don't know who needs to hear this but as a reminder, your business should work for you not the other way around. 

We use the wrong metrics to determine whether we're  successful. revenue each month, new clients, profit, etc. 

These are all focused on the business as the primary focus for growth and success as opposed to the business owner and members of the organization as the primary focus. 

I believe that most KPIs are helpful and obviously you need to have an understanding of them to know if your business is actually sustainable financially but if we're stopping here we fail to recognize what matters the most. 

Let's see some focus on KPIs of personal growth, health, lack of anxiety, peace of mind, and general joy and fulfillment in our businesses.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So true Kevin! Since starting my own business this year I have been able to focus on my own health and stress levels. I have dropped 35# so far and my goal for the calendar year is 50#. Plan on crushing that! Hitting my Kory Personal Indicators- the new KPI 😄

> **Response 2:** So much yes to this!!!! Here are some great changes I have seen in myself since becoming uncaged ( well even before being fully uncaged but starting the process) 
1.  Feeling fire again to learn and be the best PT I can be. 
2. Better sleep 
3. More energy 
4. Improved time allowing for self care which has resulted in 26lbs of weight loss 
5. Boosted self confidence 
6. Allowing myself the opportunity/giving myself permission to dream again… and then go for it. 

So many great things!

What to do on personal trainers promoting “balance training” for people? I feel like that is not in their scope of practice. How would you all combat this? Their website is basically promoting physical therapy and saying they work with people who are “recovering from illnesses or injuries.”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As long as they are not stating that they treat illness its perfectly fine for them to do training balance etc. The difference is we treat they don't.

> **Response 2:** You guys would be surprised at what personal trainers are capable of. They have a lot less restrictions on them than we do. A lot of them are now receiving training on "corrective exercise", which overlaps greatly with what we do. As someone who consumes a lot of content on Instagram and YouTube from both physical therapists and personal trainers, I will tell you that there are some amazing personal trainers out there.

I've seen personal trainers provide exercises to help with balance. I do not feel that it is out of their scope. But to treat a diagnosed balance dysfunction is where the differences arise in our training . But guess what, they can do it anyway and no one can do anything about it.  

They can practice across state lines, they don't need a physician to sign a plan of care, they don't even need to worry about their state practice act because there is not one as far as I know. If I'm wrong correct me on this. 
And they can treat Medicare patients until the cows come home and charge whatever they want. PT on the other hand,  a totally different story.

Does any unicorn in this group know if animal-assisted therapy under the supervision of a physical therapist is a covered service under medicare? From what I’ve read it seems like it’s not but skilled PT is….and it would be a combo of the two. 

If not, how do I go about finding out? 

I’m hoping to start offering private AAT services with my certified pup.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are always a therapist providing therapy with a code appropriate to your treatment. You just happen to use an animal as a mode to deliver it. They stress this in my hippotherapy certification classes.

Looking for any clinicians who specialize in concussions and/or have online resources! 
.
I was recently introduced to a 30 y/o male who has sustained multiple concussions and is looking for further support. He’s seen multiple concussion docs and hasn’t gotten much help. This past week, he met with the most renowned concussion expert on the east coast and the only advice he recieved was that he should stop all forms of exercise because he’s very tall (🤷🏻‍♀️). 
.
He’s actively searching for a PT who specializes in concussions and offers virtual sessions. He’s interested in a consult to help put some pieces together and treatment as well. Any online resources would also be helpful. 
.
He’s desperately looking for hope. He hasn’t been able to work and used to play on a high level ultimate frisbee team before his first concussion. He wants his life back and wants to find support beyond docs telling him he is fragile.

*Client is located in PA

**Community Responses:**

For the folks in mobile med b and cash only mobile practice, do you plan on adding some insurances to fill your case load…do any other insurance reimburse for mobile services other than med B or have a higher reimbursement rate and are worth getting credentialled for a solo mobile physical therapy practice…sorry for a dumb question.. I will be practicing in northwest Indiana

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The headaches of dealing with insurance companies was one of the main reasons I started my own practice.
Medicare is so easy to work with.  The private insurance companies require lots of extra paperwork, all while breathing down your neck… not to mention the difficulty of getting accurate information when you call and speak with a rep.
As a solo provider, it’s not worth the extra time/effort (in my opinion).

> **Response 2:** To help me make this decision, I did research in my area in regards to the payer mix. For an example 98% of the population have insurance, Medicare and BCBS of GA at that. I had to also consider my niche population (Lymphedema and Geriatrics) which requires frequent episodes of therapy care which can add up if cash pay. Another factor was the economic status of patients.  Taking into consideration the people I will serve and my area, insurance contracting was a no brainer. However there is opportunity for me to partake in the 2% cash pay population in the form of offering Wellness Services

What are people using for HIPAA compliant phone/texting systems?
We currently are using Google voice, but definitely are growing out of it and need a more comprehensive and better system. I did a demo with a company called Quo (formerly called open phone) and I was really impressed with them. Loved their features and everything really seemed great, but then when I started doing some digging and reading reviews, there were too many recent ones that were poor and has made me want to reconsider. 

We have four people that all need to access the phone and we need to keep texts and voice messages organized so things are not getting dropped.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting, I actually started with Iplum and had a hard time with it. I found a call quality to be poor when I was out and about, and the whole phone tree set up was so confusing . I had a hard time reaching anybody from Customer Service. That was like five years ago though so maybe they have improved ￼

> **Response 2:** Update: currently transitioning to quo…. I’ll keep you posted how it goes!

I had someone want to pay for wellness services with a HSA debit card.  I told her, um, I don't think you can use that for what you are doing with me.  She said she uses it for everything, massages, this/that (other things that I think sound questionable) and she has never had a problem with it.
I was in a hard spot because I hadn't told her before the visit that I take cash/check only.  I'm not set up for credit card payments, but I know I need to be.  So I took the card number with the intent of getting set up with Square or Stripe and then charging it.

BUT, if I charge her card, and they audit and deem it an inappropriate charge - will that come back on me?   Or will it go back on her for using it for a non-covered expense? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes !!!!!

> **Response 2:** If you are set up as a medical provider, she can use her HSA card.

Can we talk social media?  Have you found social media presence to be a big boost to your business, and if so, which platform has worked best for you?

I'm toying with the idea of really increasing my presence on Instagram. Honestly I love the platform so it would be more for fun, with minimal expectation, more as a hobby, and to learn.   But I know it's a time consuming venture so was curious if over time you had true benefits to your business doing this?  Or did you find it to be a total time suck?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is such a great conversation because I recently hired a virtual assistant/marketing firm to help me grow (and serve) my presence on social media. ￼At the end of the day it’s the last thing I gave energy to do. We see geriatrics, PD, vestibular a post op primarily. It’s been helpful for clients and their families two see us in action and get a little bit of community. ￼We’ve had no direct client growth but have “secured” clients as they reported “we saw your legit.” 😊

> **Response 2:** I think it would depend on your demographic. My patients are mostly older and I get most referrals from word of mouth and home care therapists. The only patients I received from social media were family members of friends who saw I had started a business. If you are treating younger people I would think it might be helpful. Personally I prefer making connections in real life especially being mobile and going into peoples homes.

I just want to get this off my chest about Medbridge. Since HEP2GO died I've been looking for a better HEP software.
I want to use Medbridge's HEP suite with all the bells and whistles that comes along with it because it seems to have all the features I want. BUT as a solo practice that only needs 1 license I can't just purchase the small business level of HEP services. I either have to purchase the "premium" 1 subscriber level for MORE MONEY with LESS features or purchase 2 HEP only subscriptions to get access to all the features I want at nearly the same cost as the "premium" subscription without any of the CEU opportunities. 
I'm trying to give Medbridge my money and it's like they don't want it. Rant over!

I’m reading Profit First and was wondering if anyone Is doing this method? What do you think? What bank do you use? I’m using OZK right now for my biz as it is a bit more local. 

I’m also at a cross road because some has advised to open a business credit cards to earn points. But how does that work with the profit first method? 

Thankkkss

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** NOVO banking. All good things 😘 and such a great book

> **Response 2:** I do it to an extent. I don’t have the accounts with a separate bank, but I’m following them for the most part. I do more of what Uncaged Boot Camp recommends.

My local bank was extremely easy and thankful for the business. No fees.

I have a business credit card simply for cash back to save on expenses. I think it is worth it for the free money if you are in top of your finances.

MMM stands for monthly maintenance membership, and our MMM is called the Diamond Club ￼

￼we used to also have a premium membership.

Hey! 

Based on some convos I've had with people in this group, I put together a beginner's guide on putting together an email list

Considering the return on investment of an email list is an upwards of 4400%, I think its a great thing to get started on!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks!

> **Response 2:** Something I’ve done is create pdfs of specific info (postpartum return to exercise, csection scar care, etc) and place a flyer with QR codes in doctor offices, gyms, coffee shops, etc. The QR code takes them to a landing page (I use mailchimp also) they can enter their name and email and then the requested material is automatically emailed to them. To get the automatic function you do have to pay the lowest fee of $13/mo but I think it’s worth it!

Physical therapists treating Medicare beneficiaries for cash using the  “we have no relationship with Medicare” thought process is like saying, “I don’t pay taxes because I have no relationship with the IRS”.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think I get what you’re saying here… I just want to post my two cents about Medicare

Understandably we’ve paid into the benefit through taxes, and it should be used to buffer the cost of healthcare at the age when all those expenses are hitting. 

But if individuals have the means to not use the benefit, it should be less complicated to allow them the ability to control how they spend their money. 

Advantage plans can con people right out of traditional Medicare, and into the palms of private insurance corps. But providers aren’t given a clear cut way to educate clients on resources or strategic healthcare spending…

The insurance gambit is a fixed game against providers and patients.

Medicare/Cash Based Question!  

**I tried searching through previous questions and haven't quite figured out my answer.**

I have a side cash-based only mobile PT clinic (my main business is animal PT).  I'm mainly only doing this side human PT gig so I can keep using my dry needling skills and help people with acute or chronic muscle spasms, hence the cash-based only.  So many people ask me for my services and I want to get paid for my time and needles vs giving treatment away for free (which happens a lot with family/friends).

I had a patient with Medicare contact me and she wants me to bill Medicare.  Since my business model is cash-based only, I do not need to see her, correct?  I know as PTs we can't opt out of Medicare, but if my business model does not incorporate Medicare or any other insurance, I can safely decline to see her provided I offer her other companies that accept Medicare?

Thank you in advance!

Pic for attention!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** i don't know the answer but would love to learn more about your animal PT biz

> **Response 2:** Yea not being able to opt out doesn't mean having to see patients if you don't want to

🗣️A MESSAGE‼️

A violinist played for 45 minutes in the New York subway.  A handful of people stopped, a couple clapped, and the violinist raised about $30 in tips. 

No one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the best musicians in the world. In that subway, Joshua played one of the most intricate pieces ever written with a violin worth 3.5 million dollars.

Two days before he played in the subway, Joshua Bell sold out a Boston theatre, and the seats averaged about $100. 

The experiment proved that the extraordinary in an ordinary environment does not shine and is so often overlooked and undervalued.

There are brilliantly talented people everywhere who aren’t receiving the recognition and reward they deserve. But once they arm themselves with value and confidence and remove themselves from an environment that isn’t serving them, they thrive and grow. 

Your gut is telling you something. Listen to it if it’s telling you where you are isn’t enough! 

Go where you are appreciated and valued. 

Know Your Worth.

Hello!

I'd love your input. I launched my practice five months ago, but I'm struggling to gain traction. I've partnered with a marketer who holds an extensive lead list in my local area, boasting 2,000-3,000 potential leads. He sends out emails for me 1-2 times a week, featuring a short video that I create. We meet weekly to brainstorm video ideas, and he's also working on getting me into gyms for workshops. His fee is $750/month and he covers all the operational costs. I'm planning to collaborate for three months to assess the return on investment. Do you believe his services justify the cost? As someone new to marketing, I'd greatly appreciate your feedback. 

Thank you so much for your input

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What type of cash practice.. what population?

> **Response 2:** Are you out in the community and networking? Have you met with your local direct care physicians? Reached out to nurse case managers, ones in private practice and within in hospital systems? Visited your local senior centers and give talks about your services, disease process, fall prevention ect.. whatever your target population go to where they are and be visible. I'm scheduled to talk to a local Parkinsons support group and a dementia caregivers group in January- emailed them myself, introducing myself and asking to speak on the topic. You have to put yourself out there!

I may have been the silent spectator here. However this group has provided me with lots of info and guidance in starting my own mobile cash PT. Thank you to the wonderful admins and  generous contributors in the group. 
I will continue to seek guidance from here and continue to provide help to my fellow PTs and my wonderful community that I serve. 

I waited over 3 years to get here due to lack of confidence. I am finally moving the needle. If you are on the fence, please do not waste time like I did. Seek guidance and motivation sooner! 

Here's my brand new baby:

How are all of you cash based PTs handling the demand of Shockwave therapy? I treat mostly tennis players and feel like many of them are wanting me to have this device to my practice. However I am a woman show, they are pretty expensive, and I already get great outcome with my other techniques such as dry needling. Wondering if anyone of you are dealing with the same issue and what your experience has been?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Message me and I’ll share the one I got. Researched quite a bit and used it on my own lateral epicondylitis and it’s been amazing!!

> **Response 2:** I decided not to do it because I'm an intentionally small practice. I primarily stay home with my kids. I'd have to fill my schedule with shockwave to pay for it and I like being a PT. I didn't want to trade it for being a shockwave technician.

How do you all figure out times per exercise ? If I have 60 minutes with a patient and 3 -5 minutes goes towards getting subjective and objective info that leaves 55 minutes. Rest/ transition time not billable. How do you document and justify your units. Does anyone have a system they use to meet these time requirements.  Guessing how long it takes and actually timing give different results depending on the pace of the patient and I find this time consuming to get accurate. Would love to hear how others do this quickly and accurately, justified documentation.  Thanks. I’m really on top of myself for this and wonder if most therapists are ethical about this requirement and how I can learn to be quicker.  I find myself adding lots of justification to my documentation to cya and I’m a seasoned therapist.  I find this requirement very challenging. But I do it for every patient.  Even cash patients that won’t be audited because I care about being consistent.  There has to be a better way than I am using.  One patient might take 3 minutes to do 3 sets of 10 each leg and another might take 6-7 minutes. 🤷‍♂️. Would love to hear from you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** For the record, I 100% think you are overdoing this.  I have never documented time per exercise.  I do document time per cpt code but never per exercise or rest break or any of that.  If you are spending one on one time with your client for an hour, all of that time is billable.  My note would look something like this:

97110 Therapeutic exercise (25 minutes) - strength and flexibility training to address deficits in XYZ strength and XYZ ROM

97530 Therapeutic Activity (20 minutes) - whole body activities to retrain balance, body mechanics, posture, and movement patterns during functional activities

97140 manual therapy (15 minutes) - MFR to XYZ and MET to XYZ to address pain and dysfunction 

And then below this description of my CPT codes I would list each exercise and/or activity performed. 

Therapeutic exercises and activities performed during this session: 

1.
2.
3.
Etc

This list would be thorough with reps etc but I would not list time per. 

Then in my assessment section I will document what cues were needed and response to exercise or improvements noted and challenges still present etc. 

I think documentation is already the worst part of the job and it sounds like you are making it a hundred times worse by forcing yourself to time these things. 

If I absolutely felt I had to place a time value on each exercise because insurance required it (Medicare does not and I don’t take other insurance so I haven’t seen that), I guess I would simply take my 25 minutes and arbitrarily break it up next to my list of exercises until it added up.  I wouldn’t even think about it.  I’d just say - let’s see there are 12 exercises here - 2 min each exercise and 3 min for one - done.  I would include “rest time/transition time” with the exercise - we are human not robots.   Pretty sure BCBS isn’t going to challenge your time.

> **Response 2:** Rest breaks are part of the exercise. You are not billing just for the time they are actively moving. Education is also billable. All that time is part of your treatment. If you're with them and providing care you should be billing.

Is it illegal to treat Medicare patients on an out of pocket bash based basis for physical therapy?

Background: have started a mobile cash based practice and initially had the target of under 65. I’ve had a physician want to send his folks to me- but most of his people are Medicare. I was under the impression that physical therapists cannot opt out of using Medicare for covered services- and if not lisenced by Medicare then you can’t see them. 

Is this true? If so, is there any specific site or paper I can find this written at?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are not in network with Medicare you cannot treat a Medicare beneficiary with skilled physical therapy services when the services are medically necessary.

> **Response 2:** Simple answer is no. If u want to treat Medicare beneficiaries for PT services that are covered by the Medicare program, u must enroll in Medicare.

Ortho PT’s:  any advice on retraining VMO after months of atrophy and MPFL 5 weeks ago?  I have provided an NMES unit for daily use/HEP per protocol but minimal progress.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t currently work in private practice but I have worked in D1 training rooms for quite some time, so this is actually very much my domain if you don’t mind me commenting here.

1) what e-stim machine are you using?AND What are the parameters you use using on the estim and what is the machine? Most portable machines (especially ones that can be purchased on Amazon) aren’t actually powerful enough to provide the kind of feedback to bounce back from true AMI after surgery unless meeting certain standards. Delaware produced a study not to long back looking at units and their ability to produce true motor recruitment. I have since switched to the Chattanooga portable unit (it’s about $400) and can be programmed for your patient and is a wonder!) I can forward this article. If you are using a non-portable Chattanooga device then try not using Russian estim setting, and instead trying utilizing symmetrical biphasic wavelength with 420+ phase duration and frequency of 55+ with cycle time of 10/50 for 15 mins. Still dial it up to reach borderline intolerable tetany. 

2) what are the size pads you are using? Wisconsin and a few other power 5s are utilizing 4x 8 inch pads and I got this tidbit about a year and half ago— I’ll never go back. For my smaller patients I’ll still never do smaller than 2x 4 inch pads. (Also noted in the Delaware study) the size of the pad allows you to recruit larger portions of all the muscles of the quadriceps and disperses the stim over a greater area allowing you to crank up the machine even higher and provide more electrical feedback. 

3) there is some recent research published as well on the utilization of ice specifically over the knee joint itself (basically just the patella and patellar and quad tendons and you can even put the same on the backside of knee joint) DO NOT GET ICE ON ANY SURROUNDING MUSCLE TISSUE (aka not on calves or quads) for about 10 mins immediately prior to activity. It shocks the joint proprioceptors to pay better attention to the joint motion and will decrease pain response which may be contributing to the AMI itself. 

I would try all of the above changes before ditching estim … anddd I would do all of this with quad sets so it’s not a difficult exercise when they are getting used to increased biofeedback/stimulation.(Estim should not be ditched before 80% LSI is achieved— which is much later in most rehabs than most people discontinue it— this is what OSU protocol indicates- there may even be an article I can find to support this)

Then…

4) TKE/SLR etc can all be cheated with muscles that work when you have AMI— I would switch to exercises that isolate (as much as possible the VMO) like SAQ AND ISO LAQ- although formerly believed to be taboo it’s extremely important to integrate E-stim with SAQ AND utilize E-stim with iso LAQ (belted at 60-90 deg— due to early precautions then progress) as quickly as possible in rehab (I have integrated it as early as 2 weeks post op given my patient is comfortable with 90deg flexión and min/no swelling)— estim with these two exercises specifically will help much more with the VMO (albeit the patient usually feels a bit uneasy about them— especially if it’s a quad tendon repair because they feel a bit of a tug)

your patient is 5 weeks post op so they should be able to tolerate both of these after changing parameters and pads with quad sets. The other commenters are right though MPFLs are much slower than an ACLR but you are right to be concerned. VMO activation should be back by week 6 at the very latest for probably good outcomes (not that it can’t happen… but it’s a longer bumpier road if not)

Happy to post the articles I referenced here (most of which are extrapolations from ACLR research) and I hope this helps!

> **Response 2:** To those of you who suggested BFR, what brand of device do you use and what training did you do?  (I’m mobile)

Have a post op ACL patient I’ve been seeing. He’s about to be 5 weeks out.

In my mind he’s doing great. Were able to do blazepods for balance and hip strengthening. We do BFR for short arc quads, straight leg raise, and hip abduction in supine.

He definitely does a lot of exercises at home so I’m not sitting here doing all the basic heel slide/quad set exercises so we can focus on the big stuff that he can’t do at home.

He had his appointment with the surgeon yesterday and he was not happy at all and told the patient he may have some permanent limitations because his range of motion wasn’t 100% yet.

Patient is a big hypochondriac and is freaking out. So I tried reassuring him that according to our protocol we are doing fine and to not worry. And I told him at the start of 5 weeks we’d be doing a lot more such as leg press/mini squats and really start working on the knee itself as far as range of motion.

Any advice from anyone?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t assume what he heard is what was said. 

Trust your gut. 

Unless you are in the room at the follow up visit what he thinks he heard is likely only the voice in his head.

OK. I come here as a scared and nervous dog with my tail between my legs. I know I keep getting told to build relations to get my side hustle, cash practice moving. But HOW?!? 
I have been a "loner" my whole life and am so incredibly introverted. Like to the point a cabin in the woods is my dream. 
I am still trying to work the boots on the ground approach, and literally my anxiety gets so high I feel nauseous. I start shaking. It becomes hard to unbuckle my seat belt. I don't go places regularly and don't have many friends. So my connections are minimal at best. 
How does one get past this phobia of talking to people? How do I start to put myself out there? How do I start to build relations with businesses and others to get referrals? 
Thanks for any input.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This has been hard for me too! Although I am not an introvert, but I think there is some level of anxiety for everyone! Something that helped me is reaching out to local business email or social media. Then that gives me a foot in the door and I just say "hi I'm a local business new to the area (*describe a little about yourself/business*, I love how your business does *xyz* and I can really see how we could be a great referral source for each other. Would you have any time to meet in the next 2-3 weeks for me to take you out for coffee and hear more about you and your business?" It works pretty well for me, most people either respond... or ignore me lol No one has ever been nasty... and I live in Jersey lol It gets easier with practice 🙂 you got this!

> **Response 2:** Start by committing to get there and take the seatbelt off.  Make that commitment.  Get dressed, drive there, and take you seatbelt off.  once you find yourself there it will be easier to talk yourself into the rest.  mini steps that put you in a position where it's ia almost silly to stop there.

Dear group, looking for a little advice here.  I've been in private practice PT for over 20 years in my area.  Our local hospital is purchasing many of the independent PCP offices and establishing satellite clinics all throughout our surrounding area.  I was speaking with one of their physician's regarding referrals.  He informed me if any of the provider's use an "outside" (PT) referral they will usually get a phone call from someone within the hospital system asking them why they chose to use an outside source.  In other words, the provider's are strongly 'encouraged' to refer in-house.  This has to be illegal!!  Any advice on how best to address this?  Thank you.   Please feel free to DM if needed.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have the patient ask for a physical copy of the referral. They have every legal right to that and in the end it doesn’t matter where the referral is written to for physical therapy just that it exist and the patient can produce it for the PT clinic. ￼

> **Response 2:** These hospitals are buying up all competition and getting reimbursed more for their services by insurance companies than outpatient clinics. Greed is taking over the healthcare space

Since I've gone mobile I've been having the same recurring problem, and it's making me want to tear my hear out!  I was hoping you all could share with me if you've found a useful solution...

Why does no one know their wifi passoword?  Young people and old people alike do not know their password.  They sometimes don't even know which network is theirs.  I have tried tethering my hotspot on my phone, but it sometimes won't connect and continuously gets disconnected.  

I feel it's very important for me to give them a valuable and professional looking HEP on day 1, not to mention it's nice to be able to document directly into EMR during sessions, and this problem has kept me from being able to do those things.  I've looked into getting an iPad with a cellular line just to tackle this problem, but it seems expensive and extreme.  Is there an easier way?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am more privacy oriented about this but I wouldn't give my home wi-fi password to ANYONE but my family when here. I think it is inappropriate to ask people for their wifi password.

> **Response 2:** I've never given my wifi password to anyone who comes to work in my home and don't think I would if asked. I use my phone or work offline and then upload when I get home.

Explain to me like I’m a PT toddler…in a Cash Based Wellness setting can Medicare patients cash pay? How do I document  to reflect Wellness only?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I feel like everyone is over complicating this. The OP said cash based welless practice....

It depends on what services you are offering this person in your "cash based wellness setting". If it is truly a service like personal training or fitness related and doesn't fall under physical therapy, then absolutely you can accept cash. 

Now you can't just rename it wellness if it truly is a physical therapy service, that requires the care of a physical therapist and you are treating a specific diagnosis.

But if they're seeing you just simply to get stronger, get in better shape, lose weight, etc and it doesn't fall under physical therapy, you can charge cash.

I hope that helps a bit!

> **Response 2:** “Patient is able to perform independent ADLs and self care, but is seeking additional interventions to improve tolerance and skill for recreational activities” 

Can really write whatever you want. Have a justifiable reason and get an ABN and you’re fine. Medicare is not going to come after you for saving them money, you’re just justifying receiving cash in case a patient tries to get reimbursed on the back end later. If you make sure they know it’s not covered you are unlikely to ever have an issue.

Alright everyone, I’m just looking for some advice/ place to rant. I’m ready to start seeing patients. I need to get my NPI and my consents ready but I don’t think that’ll take long, I can do consents this weekend. I’m getting discouraged because the local marketing I’ve done and will continue to do will be geared towards seniors, the clientele I like to work with. But I’m not even close to enrolling with Medicare. I know it’ll take a while to get that done. How do I deal with the calls coming in if they’re Medicare patients? “Oh yeah sorry I can’t see you because you have Medicare, OR we can only do wellness” like, this sucks! I don’t want to sound uneducated in the subject or like I can’t see these people. Probably like 85% of people I’ll be seeing in the future have traditional Medicare. It’s just so discouraging when you’re trying to get started. Any advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Getting enrolled in Medicare does not take long at all! ￼ if it’s something you want to do which I highly recommend if you’re seeing older adults, you could literally do it today ￼ and get approved in a couple weeks. Also, when you enroll, you can technically start seeing clients because it’ll go back to the date you enrolled as long as there are no issues. ￼ I’ll send you some info on the Medicare enrollment.

> **Response 2:** Once you complete the application, you can treat immediately. You would just have to hold your billing until you get approval.

Any of y’all who do group exercise classes…how did you learn how to run them lol. Any advice welcome, any classes or CEUs I’m very interested in! I’m a PWR moves certified PT so I want to feel more comfortable structuring group exercise for people with Parkinson’s 🙌🏻

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Taking exercise classes yourself can give you ideas about structure, scaling, intensity, variety etc.  I participate in a small group strengthening program myself and now run three groups for 55+. I add more agility, balance and scaling options with my PT experience.
I also follow the Modern Management of the Older Adult section of ICE. They have great social media, podcast and cont ed content.

> **Response 2:** I’ve done a couple courses from varying sources from the type of class I want to lead. (In the process of putting together a business plan.) What I find challenging is the variety of abilities that I’m *hoping* will show up to class and making it fun but challenging for everyone from an athlete to couch potato to wheelchair user. Because the group exercise classes I’ve taken more structured around splitting up ability levels which 1) doesn’t work for chronic conditions like PD and the other Neuro dx I enjoy working with whose abilities can change on the daily and 2) that rubs my DEI(inclusion) training the wrong way. So not sure how that will go until I dive in, but hoping my PT brain will serve there 😅

As others have mentioned, every course I’ve taken recommends making an outline to follow. So maybe I’ll just flesh out the outline with options to increase and decrease the intensity.

Hey group!

Just throwing a line out for some advice. This summer I am leaving my clinic for 6 weeks to join my spouse who is stationed overseas with the military. My supervisor would like me to come up with ways to minimize the financial impact to the clinic. I find it slightly odd for me to come up with ways since we have a team for this, nonetheless I will be compliant. 

Any ideas? 

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is your supervisor coming up with ways to minimize your financial loss from not working for 6 weeks? 

-signed a military spouse who has had enough of employers acting like serving our country is a vacation.

> **Response 2:** This post tells me that Ashley needs to start her own practice.  Based on what you say here, you already are the driver of this one.  It’s just that neither you nor the supervisor see that 😃

Hi everyone, I have been on the sidelines of this group with 
"analysis paralysis" for quite some time. I've had plans to start my own mobile pediatric PT private-pay practice on the side while I have a full time job, and grow slowly to see if it can become something more. Recently, I was at a conference/vendor fair and met a great local referral source who is looking for someone to provide the exact services that I would offer. It lit a fire under me to get things going and fast. My question is-what is the quickest way to get up and running and learn about the basic business side such as compiling a super-bill, covering liability, etc. I'm in SoCal. Thanks for any advice you can offer!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What Justin said, plus I'd recommend a website too. Even if  just a one page Google site for now just to get you going.

> **Response 2:** Other than the great logistical advice here,you might check out Sarah Arnold Hall on IG - she provides coaching services very relevant to getting out of being stuck in planning and systematically executing goals. She had been a huge help for me as a newer business owner! Good luck!

My car is probably going to the junkyard😵 just trying to get some opinions on what people have found works best for mobile PT (I have a table I need to fit as well as two child care seats) 😅 TIA!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Toyota RAV4 Hybrid.  Def go hybrid.  I love it!  It’s def more expensive up front but I fill up less often and the bill each time I fill up is less.  (For reference I had a Subaru Outback before, at best 28mpg and cost to fill up was around $50 and I def had to do it every week; with RAV4 Hybrid, it’s like 38mpg, cost to fill up is about $30 and I typically do it every other week if not occasionally every three weeks)

> **Response 2:** C-RV or RAV4.  I've seen more therapist with these 2 than any else, and I've been doing it for 15 years.

Hey y’all. This is a question for everyone who has started their own mobile practice.

What was the main reason you started it?

Looking back at that reason specifically, has it lived up to your expectations?

Also, looking at it now, what are YOUR biggest pros and cons of starting your own mobile practice?

Thank you in advance for your responses.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Less overhead, getting out of my W2 job, being able to provide exceptional care without having insurance dictating what we could do (cash pay practice). Better income potential than W2. And yes would never go back

Pros: flexible schedule, not paying rent for a clinic, pts love the concierge level experience vs what they get with HH

Cons: driving to other pts but isn't that big of a deal

> **Response 2:** Pro: flexibility, time to research best/updated practices, spending time with patients rather than documenting for the insurance companies, I found a new passion for business operations. 

Con: time that goes into start up, marketing takes $, balancing a job with benefits and slowly decreasing that caseload so I can slowly increase my private pay caseload.

This is just a reality check. If you are a clinician and not directly paid by Medicare and you are being paid by another entity (employer)…this is why the owner should make more money than the employee. Clearing house hack February 2024 and not being paid by Medicare October 2025. I know owners that have already taken out six figures of a loan/credit line to make ends meet this month.  This is part of this business. This is not part of any other business.  Restaurants don’t wait months to be paid by their customers. Hair Salons don’t wait months to be paid by their clients. Don’t put all your eggs in one sour basket.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** IMO this will push the UPTA civil rights lawsuit violation in the fast track. Why does the government think that we will work for free? And then tell us we can’t charge cash? Make that make sense

Had my first clients today!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HECK YEAH!!! CONGRATS!!

As far as an HEP program, it depends on what you want to provide, and who your audience is.  If it is a tech savvy audience, I love SWITCHBACK HEALTH.  I can generate my own pics or videos on the spot (or at home) and email them to the client.
The client downloads the app (free for them) where everything goes. So, now, when they want to see their exercises, the exercises can all be found in one location.   
You also have the ability to see if the client is actually going to their exercise “folder”

> **Response 2:** I use Medbridge it is good for HEP and for Con Ed

I’m hiring! I’m the owner and founder of The Healing Spot Physical Therapy, a 100% cash-based physical therapy practice in Colorado Springs, CO specializing in women's health PT during pregnancy and postpartum.

I am currently seeking an experienced therapist to join my team at approximately 10 hours per week. There is potential to work up to a full-time position, depending on the success and growth of the role. 

We currently have a 6-8 week wait list for patients who are eager to see us and get started with their care. 

I built my practice to be an environment that I love to work in - 15 minutes between patients for writing notes and no more than 7 patients daily, with full hour-long sessions so that I would have the energy to show up fully for each patient. 

My PT practice is anything BUT a PT Mill and I'm looking for someone to join me who has a passion for working with perinatal women. 

Even if you are not interested in the position,  maybe you know of someone who might be? If you have any leads or recommendations of someone who may be relocating to the area, or who is currently in Colorado Springs but is not satisfied with their employment situation, I would be incredibly grateful if you pass along the information!

Thanks so much for your time and consideration and any help you can offer. Feel free to reach to me with a DM if you have questions! 

Pay and benefits are negotiable.

3 important factors that helped me the most to grow 2 very successful businesses over the past 7 years:
1. Imperfect Action - taking action even when I felt that I didn't have everything perfectly set up. I was led by one leading factor - I have what it takes to help someone significantly, and I'm not going to delay in giving others value because I want to be perfect. 
1. A WHY bigger than myself - Your reason WHY must move beyond yourself. "No one should seek their own good, but the good of others." - 1 Corinthians 10:24 NIV
1. Being humble enough to ask for help. Asking for help and getting mentorship was one of, if not the TOP factor, that helped me to succeed. I would suggest you do the same.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm working on the first one...does not mesh well with my type A personality 😜

Can PTs create an LLC? I’ve been doing some research and it looks like “medical professionals” can’t open a practice using an LLC it has to be an s-corp? 

Thanks for the insight!

With Q4 starting, we are all thinking about future plans and growth.

With the current Medicare proposed cuts for 2025, where do you realistically see the profession in 2, 5, and 10 years?

What are you planning to do to combat the potential cuts and remain profitable?

Just want to open the discussion to let people brainstorm together and share ideas.

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Depend less on insurance and implement more cash services

> **Response 2:** I just hired 4 part time clinicians and got my first brick and mortar (we’ve been telehealth).   I also know that when Medicare cuts other private insurance products follow suite pretty soon.  I’d love to know the secret of those who are full and busy only doing private pay

This year has been very challenging for me… 

Overwhelm….
Underwhelm…
Frustration…
Boredom….
Overwork….
Underwork…
Underpay….

All these emotions/ situations wrapped up in a single day, week, month and starting the year.  Getting away from my roots and proven known business concepts has left me paralyzed.  Speaking with my accountability partner these last few days has left me with the realization that I fill my days with tasks that don’t serve me, my family, my finances or my business. (Yes in that order). I feel busy, but what I am doing is holding space for tasks that won’t move me forward and missing opportunities that could… self sabotage is real and this is my limiting belief… “being busy will get me to my goals”. I’ve been lying to myself for the past 30-40 years and have limited myself dramatically.  This year will be different.  

I refuse to allow myself to be held back and kill my dreams… I am working through my limiting beliefs and making changes to fix myself.  Saying no to things is the first thing I am changing. Let this year be YOUR year to make amazing changes so that all your dreams can come true and you can change your life.

This comment from a patient today made my heart smile:

Patient: I love that you are so open and willing to talk about sexuality and gender identity. It’s rare to find a Doctor that isn’t either dismissive of me being non-binary or they just choose to dodge the topic entirely. It’s just refreshing to have you as a provider. 

This is why I’m pushing so hard to show LGBTQ+ people that they have an ally in their local healthcare community. There is such a huge disparity on how they are treated. 

When my patients come see me they will feel heard and be treated with kindness, empathy, and respect of their own individual belief systems.

What are everyone's thoughts on being an APTA member? Worth the cost?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a member.  We have no better option for power on Capitol Hill!  If we lose that, our profession heads in a very bad direction (or continues to).  If we had even half-way decent membership % we could push for some real change and reimbursement.  If not, we can probably just keep watching reimbursements fall 🤷🏻‍♂️

> **Response 2:** We have 100,000 members but there are 500,000 PTs and PTAs in the US. Membership makes the APTA stronger. Without membership we lose our collective voice. We need advocacy for our profession. Become a member, attend local chapter meetings, or join the board of your local chapter. As a member and board member, I recognize many benefits: connections/networking, professional development opportunities, continuing ed, online resources, and reduced rates for conferences to name a few.

Is the grass really greener? Is it though, really?
That’s what I wrestle with on a daily basis. I’m currently working full-time in large hospital. It’s standard corporate healthcare, with all of the usual BS. I like my job, though. I get paid relatively well (or so I think). No weekends, no holidays. My patients love me, and I love them. I am a parent of young kids. I value my time more than anything. I like that I don’t have to think about work when I finally come home at night. And yet, I still struggle with the “what if?”… what if I’m missing out on something? Would becoming Uncaged and breaking out on my own make me happier? Would it make me lonelier, not constantly being around coworkers? Would it mess with my mental health? Would it steal my time away from my kids? Does anyone regret going out on their own? I’m sure there are many opinions out there, and maybe this group is inherently biased towards breaking out, but I’m curious and would love honest feedback.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** "I value my time more than anything", is what you wrote. My perspective is this - my business is my 3rd child. The nice thing? I have flexibility over my schedule when the first borns need me. The hard part? The 3rd child always needs attention to! 🙂

> **Response 2:** Based on everything you said - stay where you are. If/when you start hating your job and you want more schedule flexibility and more control of how you treat your patients in order to eventually get paid more to do less, then branch out. But right now…. Stay put my friend! Business is not easy, especially at first. I was lonelier for sure. I’m eager to get back into a team setting at some point, but would only ever join a primary care practice.

So we are almost 2 years into our business. Holy moly what a ride! We are now switching from LLC to S-Corp (we are in Ohio). We are converting our 2 indep contractor PTs to employees. Looking to add front office/admin help. We are in works of expanding our business plan with a God size dream with things outside of the PT realm. 

Does anyone do business consulting where we meet a few times to look at current structure, help get things more streamlined before more growth, make sure we have good systems in place? I don’t know that we want extensive business coaching long term at this point? Basically need help tidying up before growth. The business took off way faster than expected and some unorganized things so I feel we need some more organizing before more growth. Look at insurance, P&P, etc and how to hire essentially. We feel pretty good but always nice for an outside expert to take a look.

**Community Responses:**

I’m curious what your thoughts would be if you learned of a chiropractor in your area basically performing physical therapy in their clinic. Today I learned of a relatively new chiropractic clinic near me who advertises their services as “chiropractic adjustments, dry needling, functional rehabilitation, Gaston/IASTM, FAKTR, and cupping.” She also advertises pregnancy and postpartum care including stretching and exercises. I’m not exactly sure what all chiropractors are trained in, but it seems like this practice is blurring the line between chiropractic and PT. The name of the clinic doesn’t even have chiropractic in it. I’m on the fence about reaching out to this chiropractor as a potential referral source (her to me and me to her). I’m also trying to have the mindset of “there’s enough to go around” and not see her as competition, but it’s hard not to.

Update: I called and spoke to the chiropractor yesterday. She hasn’t even opened her doors yet but does next week. I’m meeting with her next Friday morning. She sounds really nice and was excited to hear from me. 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A good chiro and a good PT should practice pretty similarly

> **Response 2:** Chiropractors can bill 97110 and 97112, so what they are advertising is perfectly fine.  They just can’t call it physical therapy. 
I market myself on social media performing grade V manipulations of the spine, but I call it manipulations and not adjustments or chiro care.  We are very similar professions, so there is a lot of crossover.

Hello UC friends, I'd love to hear your thoughts. 
Is it possible to hire a PTA as a 1099 IC?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did!!

> **Response 2:** My husband is a labor and employment attorney. He did a whole webinar on this for PTs. An IC shouldn’t be performing the same work as your business (think hiring a painter) and you can’t tell them when and how they work. If you really follow the rules, it’s pretty hard to hire an IC that’s a PT or a PTA.

Hey guyys, i've seen some people talk about this, but honestly I don't know how I feel about it. I have a PT I work with that's COMT certified and his treatment methods are very different to McKenzie methods. Ive seen  posts where is has  been mostly COMT PT's bashing MDT PT's but honestly I'm trying to see where they find Maitland methods to be better.
A lot of the good McKenzie therapists, does not see this as "everyone does extension, they get better." They see it as a diagnostic tool. There has been several patients in my career that have been not extension responders but have been even
flexion or rotational movements. We over flex as a society given that functional activities are in some form of flexion mostly. That's why I think most people respond best to extension because we over flex which cause changes in the spine/discs.
For those who have had both Mckenzie training and Maitland training what do you feel is a more ideal method to diagnose and treat patients?
Also, do you find one method or the other to be better for different pathologies?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No one should be bashing any one style. The reality is, they all help for the right patients. Some patients will respond better to Maitland, others to Mckenzie, others to [insert other style]. Your job as a PT is to have as many tools in the toolbox as possible so that when you come across a patient, you can not only fit them into the right style but the right technique in that style. Not everyone is a Mckenzie patient. And that's ok. I do a lot of counterstrain- and not everyone is a counterstrain patient, and that's ok.

> **Response 2:** I’m Maitland certified and I think it’s appalling that any PT is bashing another technique.  
I think the best PTs are the ones with lots of varying tools available to them.
At its core, Maitland is an assessment approach (not a treatment technique).  The accessory mobility assessment does often lead to treatment (ie. Mobilizations) but in actuality I find the treatment often aligns with preferential directional treatment (which I believe falls under the McKenzie theories).

I’m not McKenzie trained, but I have worked with McKenzie therapists… and I think the two approaches actually blend quite well together.

Friends! I need personal PT help! I was running out to the front yard this evening and while taking a step felt and heard a snap in my L gastroc muscle belly. Immediate pain and I couldn’t put weight on my foot. It’s not my Achilles. Currently I’ve been icing and elevating, have a compression sock on my lower leg, and have taken Motrin and Tylenol. I have significant pain if I try any DF with knee extension, and I’m able to DF some but not to neutral with my knee flexed to 90 with gravity eliminated. I don’t see any bruising and my calf is VERY tender to touch. 

Obviously I tore my gastroc, but does anyone have helpful tips? I already ordered a CAM boot that will get here in 2 days, and I have red light, cups, ice, a pretty crappy US machine, and rock tape. Anyone else want to throw an idea at me to make this miraculously better?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like might be plantaris tendon rupture. 

MICE. Movement.ice.compression.elevation. Just be aware of compartment syndrome very unlikely but good to keep an eye on it. 

This will get better and good luck!!!🍀💪

> **Response 2:** I had this exact thing last year. I’d limit anti-inflammatories unless the swelling gets out of control. Let the healing process happen. 

I used BFR, sleep, and walking as much was tolerated. Slowly added stairs.

I tried some KT tape to just assist with that hug everyone loves, but it was really only helpful for 1-2 days when acute.

For those that use Luna to see patients that want to use their Insurance, what is your script when discussing pricing? Initially I imagine you discuss you are OON and your Cash price. If they decide they want to use insurance, then what are you saying to them to put them through the Luna system? Are you verifying their benefits to know if they might be better OON, than paying towards deductible with Luna? Wondering what has been successful for others using this method.

**Community Responses:**

Anyone running a cash based clinic for geriatric clients (Medicare beneficiaries), how do you notify your clients with Medicare that you can’t provide PT? Do you charge less for wellness sessions or keep the flat rate? Can this even work? I go back and forth in my head thinking it can and then that it can’t…in need of some help here. I love working with seniors, really anyone over 50, and really want to make this work. Want to be able to provide PT to non Medicare beneficiaries but know most will be 😖

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Heather Reichenau nope! I know it sounds funny but that's what I meant. I truly believe that the results for which many older adults are looking, require a focus on wellness sessions which help to establish a lifestyle change. Those results are not possible in your typical therapy POC...which is why so many just continuously go through the cycle of immobility after discharge from skilled care, never reaching their goals. Educating medical providers, families, and most importantly patients about these legal cash pay services is the future. One by one we can change the lives of so many. 

To add to this, which may sound even crazier, the quality of care with the insurance based model has gone so far down, that patients don't even want it. But anything medically necessary has to go by the rules.

> **Response 2:** It is very tricky because if you treat a Medicare beneficiary and falls under the realm of skilled PT you cannot accept cash.

I work a lot with the geriatric population as well I was really hesitant about having to deal with insurance. But I did go ahead and enroll with Medicare and  they paid very quickly on my first client.
Their rules are actually quite simple and as long as you follow all of the documentation and CMS requirements you should be fine.
When you add Medicare and the secondary it was about $105 a visit.
You can always add non covered services to the mix that are not covered by Medicare but you'll have to be very upfront with your patients so they understand what constitutes a covered and non-covered service under Medicare

Hi 👋🏼 need some advice on how to tell a patient you can’t see them anymore. He’s a real energy sucker, and I need to protect my mental health. He’s been through a lot and I gave him a contact of a local counselor in our area to work things out with. I’m seeing him for a total knee replacement since the local PT clinic doesn’t take his insurance. I am out of network with his insurance though and had to get pre-authorization to see him. 

He had his operation July 21st. Probably needs a manipulation (active range is about 90° flexion incredibly painful and he’s lacking 12° extension). I came into the picture about eight weeks postop. 

Any advice is appreciated. I live in a small rural community so don’t want a bad name because of this

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always play the card of wanting them to get the best care, and emphasizing that you’ve exhausted what you think you can do. Recommend back to ortho or trying another PT who “may have other tools or skills available”

> **Response 2:** I would tell him that you think you’ve taken him as far as you can and refer him back to the Dr. something is not right and beyond your scope of service if he has not progressed past that, especially with the extension. Does the Dr have a good reputation? They are ultimately responsible for patient response if they did the surgery.

How do you create breaks in your day?

When I was in my mobile practice, I got my breaks driving from client to client. 

Doing so gave me the opportunity to “get outside”.

Now that I spend my days mostly on zooms, I find that I have to be intentional about grabbing a mental refresher. 

No matter the weather, I love to get out in the sun if but a few minutes.

Yes, even in the summer when it’s 115 degrees. 

I’d love to hear what your favorite thing to do is as a “break” in your day.

Next week I start one day a week working on my own practice! I have a space, an LLC, a name, a treatment table, and a disdain for insurance billing. I have never done it on my own, but know I don't really want to. 
- I will likely have to contract with Medicare because my ideal population is Geriatric. Otherwise, I live in a pretty rural area with significant low-income population. 
- What I am wondering, or hoping I guess, is that some others who are practicing cash based in rural, low- income areas may be able to offer advice or ease of my concerns about charging enough to make this all worth it and not scaring away patients d/t cost.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Out of curiosity, what does it mean to be “in contract” with Medicare? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of being cash-based? Sorry, i’m a new grad so this is all new to me.

> **Response 2:** I am working one day/week in a small rural town. I am finding it very difficult to drum up the business I would like. I think I can break into some community education and make a couple bucks that way, and possibly pick up some clients too; but cash pay is extremely new to people here and they believe in their insurance. Tough to break through that facade and clue them in to the benefits both physically and financially of cash-pay healthcare.

I have a cash based pelvic floor PT clinic and I also take Medicare. A patient called me and said she had Medicare, so I scheduled her and then had her email me her Medicare card. This is what she sent me. Is this a Medicare advantage plan? Would she have to be a cash pay patient since this isn’t Medicare? Thank you. New to this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, that is an advantage plan and you would have to be in-network with Aetna. It may have out of network benefits, but I doubt it.

> **Response 2:** Yes, this is a Medicare Advantage plan, as others above have stated. Because it is a PPO, she has out of network benefits and you can bill her insurance without your practice being in-network or having a contract with Aetna. These PPOs often have a large deductible or out of pocket max that the patient has to meet prior to insurance “kicking in” for services. You are allowed to have these patients private pay since it’s not a traditional Medicare plan (sometimes they’re more willing to go this route if you can provide them with a superbill so they can submit it to insurance themselves). Hope that helps!

Medicare has me scratching my head… I am starting a cash based mobile PT business very soon. Many of the patients around Cape Cod have Medicare and have reached out to me for services. I am fearful and confused on pursuing the Medicare populations for compliance purposes. So far everyone I have spoken too are mixed about it. I just did a random chatGPT search and this came up. 

Anyone treat Medicare beneficiaries and have some insight and can provide insight onto how to approach Medicare for payments, etc?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Gwen Simons is a PT/attorney and a great resource that many cash based therapists. I signed up for her program and she's helped me navigate all of this stuff. Highly recommend!

> **Response 2:** Are you individually enrolled with Medicare? If you’ve treated patients recently through an employer that accepts Medicare, chances are you could still be enrolled, so this would be relevant and you wouldn’t want to accept cash pay from Medicare beneficiaries. You can check the status of your Medicare enrollment though the PECOS portal

Not having the bad doesn't make you good... 

I've had several times over the past couple weeks where I've been on calls with people interested in starting a business and they say something to the effect of, "I just want to get away from the crappy way healthcare is run." 

I get it. I've been there and have had some really bad experiences in healthcare and in jobs in the past. 

But just moving away from the bad and not being like them only goes so far. 

Each time I've asked, "what do you want your business to look like, what's the GOOD you're going to bring?" and each time the person couldn't answer it. 

Absolutely move away from the bad in healthcare but don't start there. Fill your business with things that are inspiring, hope providing, excellent, client focused, etc.

What HEP apps is everyone using?  I want something that will do RTM.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use switchback health app. Been loving it so far and was built by a PT for PTs.

> **Response 2:** I think truecoach does this where you can have a dialogue with patients directly through the app. In theory this is great but it isn't cheap. Medbridge allows for patients to check in but not sure if it allows for dialogue. Also medbridge makes it really difficult and not pretty to make workout splits, ie different exercise on M/W/F while true coach allows that pretty easily. 

Because of this, I just use google sheets with commenting turned on. If i had more cash pay patients, I'd probably use true coach .

I despise marketing emails.  I hate getting them... they immediately get trashed.  But "everyone" says to build your email list and send out the emails routinely.  I read in a book recently that you should expect about a 1% conversion on emails if you're making an offer.  So, despite hating the very thing that I was advised to do, I created a flyer and sent out an email with an offer of 20% off multi-visit packages through the end of the year.

You guys.

I sent the email out FOUR days ago to about 180 people, and I've sold SEVEN packages since then - about half of those are routine clients who would've purchased packages anyway, but at least one person is someone who had been a client earlier in the year and the email kickstarted him to come back.

Moral of the story: send the email, make the offer!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Truth

> **Response 2:** And to piggy back off that conversation we had about it, better is different for each business. I look at it like air. Air in itself isn’t good or bad but is dependent upon the circumstance. Air to survive…extremely good and vital. Air to a fire…more destruction. 

Better depends on both your short and long term goals. And like we talked about before, comparison is the devils tactics. Better for what I need could be detrimental to someone else if they are using better as a comparison.

Hello! I just finished a PhD in Health Sciences, Human and Sport Performance. I am practicing as an LMT but also have CSCS. 

Right now I’m a mobile massage therapist as I gain clientele. I specialize in Thai massage on the mat, clinical sports massage, and lymphatic drainage massage. 

I have extensive training in teaching mindfulness and meditation. Hoping to add small group classes when I find the perfect studio space.

I’m also approved as a CE provider for LMTs… 3 different categories: Business, Ethics, and Perinatal

I’m just beginning to navigate the waters of what a business could look like for myself. I’m finally released from the demands of the dissertation! I feel so free. I’m open to any suggestions you may have! We live in South Carolina

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Such a big need for therapists with lymphatic knowledge in my area - wish you were closer! If I were you, I’d reach out to cancer centers who can refer people with lymphedema, as well as plastic surgery centers who may have clients that could use this type of massage to release fluid after surgery (e.g., tummy tuck, liposuction, etc). Good luck!

AI Receptionist. So I had an interesting demo this week.

Background: I got a part time receptionist who is horrible answering calls/talking to people etc. afraid of what else is out there with my limited income, I started looking for VAs. Came into a facebook ad for virtual AI receptionist and filled form for info (was curious). 

About 5 min later I got a call from the company. Hayle spoke to me, answered questions, scheduled a demo. I get a text confirming, an email with zoom and a PS: hayle was an ai not human. I could never tell. 

I was super excited for my demo yesterday. They build you a full system. Your receptionist answers calls, questions, emails, texts. They teach her everything. They integrate with chat gpt.. it schedules appointments, reschedules, call, email or text patients after sessions to follow up how they are doing, sends intakes, call each lead about 5 min after they click your ad (apparently anything less than 4 min is considered creepy by people 🤷🏻‍♀️)…. Call patients who canceled and not returned within few weeks to check what is up… the only thing it doesn’t do is check insurance verification. If they realize patient is very upset, situation is critical and require a human, they say it will have doctor call you back after next appointment. It even takes payments and leave credit card on file…

I was all in until cost: $7500 set up fee + 0.2 a min call (email and texts are free). Well to br fair after i had a heart attack with price and hang up they did text offering $5k if i paid in 1 payment. 

I don’t worry that much of the 0.2 min call… because my volume is low. But set up not being sure it will work is scary…

Thoughts? Any experiences?

Ps: for an extra tour Va can have your own personal voice and be “you”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a consumer, AI gives me the ick. Knowing who is answering and seeing them when you get there is special. Hunt you down a a good human and lay expectations hard before they start. We are on our third receptionist in 5 years (none got fired, just moved away) but our girl now is amazing!! I think we just got better at voicing our expectations.

Hello 🙂 

I put together a checklist of things that I would consider paramount to include in any rehab, wellness or recovery plan 

1. Are you hitting the physical activity guidelines (2+ days per week of muscle strengthening activity and 75-150per week of vigorous aerobic activity)
2. Are you sleeping 7-9 hours a night?
3. Are you hitting your recommended protein target (1.6g/kg body weight)? 
4. Are you hitting your daily fiber goal (25-30g)
5. Are you getting >5 servings fruit and veg per day?

I see a lot of talks in here about what to charge for dry needling only sessions, how much a red light therapy coffin costs or what frequency vibrations should be in the vibration stimulation room. Are these the most health promoting things we can be spending time and money on? 

If your patients don’t hit these markers, is there a push by you to achieve them? If not, why? 

Finally, are you hitting these markers yourself?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BAM 💥 
Let’s talk about the factors causing the problems 💪👊💥

If you let your license lapse or cancel it, can you still call yourself a Doctor of PT because of your degree, and then get like a personal training license and technically practice under that with no stupid rules or restrictions?  Thinking out loud 😬...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have OFTEN wondered this….

> **Response 2:** My understanding is that you are always held to the highest standard of your education (always makes me think of a person with a black belt in martial arts getting jumped in a nonprofessional fight on the streets, then the courts considering her hands as deadly weapons when she harmed the attackers🤣) . So even if you are not a licensed PT and are a certified personal trainer, your actions can be held to PT standards. 

More thinking out loud…I am also an athletic trainer and have wondered several aspects of this conundrum over the years.  One factor is which of many “stupid rules & restrictions” is one trying to avoid. The other would be the state practice act..think my state does not allow the use of “physical therapy” or “physical therapist” if not licensed, so one would have to be careful on verbiage with advertising, etc…but saying “Doctor of,” “degree in Physical Therapy” would be fine as long as misrepresentation of licensure is not alluded to. Another factor is in the last several years, I have discovered that a lot of the “stupid rules & restrictions” are actual folklore/myths perpetuated in our profession and by graduate programs who have not updated their curriculums, as well as being confused with requirements by insurance carriers, including Medicare.

Anyone out there with experience with a tibiofibular cyst?  This is a 16 yo

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Multiple structures are often injured with a lateral meniscus injury and when repaired the meniscus is repaired but the other elements of the arcuate complex are rarely addressed.  This fixates abnormal
Mobility of the meniscus but neglects the other structures that MRI doesn’t pick up.  

In my office I’d check multiple angles of varus laxity (involved vs. uninvolved), tib fib motion as well as ankle mobility (tib fib mobility is exaggerated with ankle lateral instability) and appreciate under US the other stabilizing elements of the lateral complex bilaterally.

If you have a shockwave system it can help scar the capsules and components of the lax ligaments. Electrical dry needle placement on affected ligaments can help decrease laxity, but you’d have to place it on both ends of the affected tissue with the anode/cathode, and the needle placement needs to be precise.

Has anyone ever treated or worked with someone with Slipping Rib Syndrome? I have a new client coming in tomorrow who is desperate for help, and I’ve never even heard of this disorder before. I’ve done some research tonight and it looks like core stabilization and general trunk and upper body isometrics will probably be best, but I’d love some tricks of the trade of anyone has some.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I treated someone post surgical for slipped rib recently. They were given very poor guidance from the surgeon as this is a very rare occurrence in our area but she did well once her surgical pain was managed. She was very debilitated and needed to work on  endurance, core and postural exercises.

> **Response 2:** Recently had an older patient with 12th rib slipping, very painful to walk but sitting was fine. Her husband is a retired physician and they did a lot of research and didn’t find much. She gets some relief from TENS and regular injections. Unfortunately nothing else seemed to help.

Here is a visual of why someone would pay you cash.. no insurance. This is a “not small business” (>1000 employees) a family of 3…. Would have to spend $45,000/ year before insurance kicks in. Why even take the plan out??? Just get major medical and pay the rest yourself. What a joke

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What makes it worse is that there are instances where you could find better coverage on your own but you aren’t allowed to purchase because your employer offers you a plan… they literally tie your hands. Only way to finally get the lowest premiums I have ever paid for family coverage was to go self employed.

Hi guys,

How do you guys contact gyms, yoga studios, or any facilities that you want to build a relationship with? 

What type of marketing do you do? 

I am starting a cash based mobile PT practice but unsure how to get started on marketing. I am in the process of completing my website right now.

I would appreciate any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just started my cash based mobile PT business about month ago. I stopped by some local gyms/studios that had a similar mission. When speaking to the owner, I told them how I could benefit them by keeping their members healthy or help them recover quickly from an injury. Now they are putting my info cards in all of their new member bags. I'm also providing inservices to their trainers.

> **Response 2:** Give more than you take. That’s super important when starting relationships. I highly discourage going in to meetings/emails just touting what you do and how you can help their clients. I suggest trying their services out, taking some of their classes, collaborate on a workshop/event, build a relationship—this takes time.

**Original Post:**
I have never been in this situation before, any insight is helpful (especially if you happen to know labor laws). 
We have a new therapist who began treating patients but due to a variety of issues is being let go. Since starting a caseload about two weeks ago, this therapist has seen patients for several visits but has not completed a single note (yes, despite being told to, yes despite knowing it’s required to have notes done within 48-72 hours… all part of why she isn’t going to work out).

On this past Friday she was let go, and she was given until Sunday night to complete all her notes. Upon reviewing the notes on Monday, it was evident that none of the notes had charges attached and frankly, all were incomplete (e.g. no mention of skilled care, incorrect execution and interpretation of outcome measures, goals that were very poorly written). I’m reluctant to submit any of them for Medicare because they don’t meet basic documentation requirements and would rather not risk making us vulnerable to accusations of fraud or abuse. I detailed all areas of every note that need to be corrected and gave her until this evening (Tuesday) to make the corrections; however, my practice team and I are not optimistic because she acknowledged the email but otherwise we have not heard from her and the notes remain unchanged. (In the email I told her that I insisted she work with the practice manager to correct these errors, but she has not heard back from her). 

Any idea what my recourse is here? 
If a therapist doesn’t complete notes, am I required to pay them? 
And before anyone suggests that maybe her training or support from the practice factors into this, please know that this therapist was provided with many hours of training, support, training materials, one on one meetings, offers for meetings, education… At some point the therapist just has to do their job. We can’t see the patient and document for her. (For reference she is a W2).

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To make it easier on her and yourself I would tell her you are going to contact the board if she doesn't finish the notes. It will lead to a greater chance of getting the notes done.  Following through with the board thing will probably take an enormous amount of time and the notes will still be incomplete.  Best of luck

> **Response 2:** I started with holding the last paycheck until all records are turned in and I put this in their employment agreement. Not sure if its too late.

Also if she tries to claim unemployment, not completing documentation goes against company policy and thus she was fired, not eligible for unemployment. Fight it so your rates dont up.

How often are your patients having adverse reactions to dry needling?  I try to warn them that they may be sore for 1-2 days following our session but I feel like with upper traps specifically, my patients often have an increase in their pain for a few days.  Is there something I’m missing with upper trap techniques for dry needling specifically?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Describe your treatment approach - not enough information for anyone to accurately answer. 

I first learned dry needling from a more aggressive, piston-until-it-stops-twitching, treatment philosophy. I was so excited to use it in clinic the following Monday, and on the first patient I could - a pretty irritable glute tendinopathy. They did come back for a second session, thankfully, but asked that I never dry needle them again!

What I’ve found over the years is that certain body parts are more sensitive to it, that certain people are more sensitive to it, that I had eventually gravitated to “piston less, stim more” before Paul Killoren coined it as a phrase, and that we always need to appreciate the symptom irritability of the patient before us.

I would treat that “first patient” so much differently now than I had that day.

> **Response 2:** Soreness after needling for 24-48 hours isn’t uncommon but it shouldn’t be excessive, otherwise it’s an indicator that your techniques were likely too aggressive. 

The upper traps have an emergent point and motor point in the same ballpark so they tend to get extra ‘twitchy’ - those local twitch responses from pistoning can definitely make someone pretty sore and achey, so have to feel out your clientele to judge whether or not you think they can handle it (and if it’s even appropriate)

**Community Responses:**

Don’t make the mistake of charging al a carte for those services though. Just charge what you would charge for an hour and include what you think the patient needs

**Original Post:**
Hello felllow Uncaged!  This post is a follow-up to a post that I made last week about offering paid wellness visits that are NOT considered PT.  I met with my lawyer today, and she told me the following facts that I thought you all might find useful:

1) While it is possible (of course) to charge for this service, whether it is considered "legally physical therapy" or not is up to the law where the patient is present when receiving the service.  For example, If the patient is in Ontario when you performed the service (in person or over phone/video) you would be subject to laws in Ontario.  It is nearly impossible to know how each jurisdiction would behave in the event of a law violation or complaint EVERYWHERE in the world.  

2)  The typical course of action of a governing board such as a state PT board to a practic act violation would be a cease and desist.  If you are sent a cease and desist, you can try to present evidence that you are NOT, in fact, violating the practice act to see if you can convince them to let you continue, or you could simply cease and desist and let it go.  They would only have you cease and desist in THEIR jurisdiction.  For example if the California state board felt that you were performing PT without a license there, they would send you a letter demanding you cease and desist what you are doing IN California.  The chances of legal repercussions or losing your license is low.

3)  You need to advertise what you are doing clearly and specify how it is NOT physical therapy.  The best method to do this is to define Physical therapy as precisely as possible (I.e. performed by a licensed physical therapist, consists of an evaluation, PT diagnoses, customized goals and treatment), and then point out that your wellness program is NOT that (i.e. can be performed by a person who is NOT a licensed physical therapist, does NOT include an evaluation, PT diagnosis, or customized goals and treatment).

4) My lawyer suggested having a contract for the client to sign where they agree to terms, including that they have been informed that this is not PT and will not include anything that would be considered PT or would take the place of medical treatment.  I'm sure that's not all the contract will cover, but she is writing up something formal for me.

5)  Medical liability insurance may not cover a consultation like service.  You need to check with your liability insurance company about whether they would cover it, and if not you need to get general business liability insurance.

6)  Keep records of visits, but those records should not look like a medical record or a Pt evaluative or treatment note in any way.

7)  Treatment or advice cannot be custom unless you are referring to things other providers have already diagnosed them with/advised them of.  Example:  if a neurologist has diagnosed someone with Parkinson's, you can provide them with a general handout from the Parkinson's foundation and go over it with them.  Example 2:  If a doctor had ordered PT for this person recently, but the patient refused to go due to the time commitment as the clinic is far away, you could encourage them to go to PT and help them find a clinic that is nearer to them.

8.  USE YOUR PT KNOWLEDGE to know what is considered NOT PT!  You are literally the expert witness they might call to see if someone who is claiming not to practice PT is practicing PT!  You know the definition because you are the expert.  So don't do anything that is considered PT!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was just dealing with this very issue for a prospective telehealth client - thank you!

> **Response 2:** Re:#5, are “free consults” in a typical PT sense covered by our traditional liability?????

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There is McDonalds... and everyone else. 
There is Starbucks... and everyone else. 

Fox has spent lots of money establishing themselves as the Kleenex of physical therapy. Nobody says "Grab me a fascial tissue." They say grab me a Kleenex. 

So since Fox owns the general home physical therapy space, you can build a presence in the specialty space. You can be the post surgical knee guy or the skin breakdown guy or the ??? guy.

Just go one layer down.

> **Response 2:** Weighing in after watching this for a while. To compete with Fox you have to be different than Fox, but also don’t be afraid to collaborate with Fox. What can you do to build up your reputation to be ‘the best’ option? Quality therapy? Specialty programs? Better/more direct customer service? Market as a locally owned business? Make the most of your smaller scale - get to know the providers and local home health agencies so they know YOU and trust you are the best option for their patients. And reach out to your local fox manager to let them know you can help if there are regions they can’t provide therapy in. I know my local fox regional directors and often refer back and forth if/when we can’t accommodate someone due to waitlist or territory and they do the same for us. We often have patients seeing a Fox PT and a Healthy Aging Physical Therapy OT etc. make friends ..not enemies :)

I'm not sure what to do....one of my contractors went into labor early and lost the baby. What is something I can do for her? (besides giving her unlimited leave) Just something to say I'm sorry and I care. I just can't imagine the pain she must be feeling.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a loss mom-I can give you one piece of advice: LISTEN to her, give her her feelings back.  Please do NOT say 
1) God needed an angel
2) It will get better in time
3) God has a plan
4) God only gives us what we can handle
5) I know how you’re feeling 
Instead, here’s what you CAN say
1) “What can I do?”
2) I don’t know what to say
And I can tell you-send her a grocery list of paper towels, toilet paper, paper plates, napkins, & food. 
I am SO sorry that she is going through this. This is the WORST possible pain any mother can go through.

> **Response 2:** I want to say thank you for changing the perspective and giving her your support. I been in the corporate PT where they didn't care of your loss and bombard about getting notes done and just not being supportive during the process. She will be very appreciative of just knowing you are there to help her. 

This is the type of boss I imagine myself being to not just think financially but also treating my employees like family and giving them time to grieve as needed.

**Original Post:**
I currently have a cash-based mobile PT side hustle that I plan on doing full time soon. I was approached by a local PT who has a booming business (>6 month wait list) to work in her office (still be my own biz owner). She mentioned taking 20% of each visit for my patients and 50% of each visit when I see her patients. My patients are defined as anyone I bring in (for example, if I treat one of my mobile patients in the office) and her patients are anyone who calls to see her (so if someone calls to see her and learns of the 6 month wait list and doesn't want to wait, she'll direct them to me). 50% seems really high to me so I'm curious to get other's opinion's on this! For context, she has a great reputation, >20 years experience, has mentioned she'd be willing to teach me in some specialized areas and otherwise is very flexible with no min number of days/hours required and I would still work for myself. That being said, it's still 50% for a finders fee and I would be doing all of the work with the patient. Since I'm just going from side hustle to full time, I am a bit nervous about building up a case load and this would be one way that could majorly help with that. Does anyone else practice in a similar model? What % split seems fair and reasonable given this situation? I'd love to hear all thoughts an opinions! Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When you hire someone you plan to pay them 30-50% of the revenue they bring in. It sounds like she’s looking at it like you’re an employee

> **Response 2:** I can understand why this may sound as if the price is skewed to her benefit, but IT SHOULD BE! I won't advise on numbers or percentages but will offer you the view from the other side of the coin. When you are just starting out as your own business, it may seem as if the therapist is doing all the work(providing care to the pt and completing the documentation) and yes this is the revenue for the business. However, you need to realize how much goes into the greater picture of running a business than just treating patients and as many people in this group are just starting out, the full picture isn't visible yet(it wasn't for me until this year as I decide to grow my business with additional team members, services, products). As she is a business owner of a brick and mortar clinic, >20 years of experience, high reputation and an impressive 6 month waiting list, she has done EVERYTHING!  She has put in her time, effort, risk, sleepless nights, 60-80 hr work weeks, covering any shift a staff can't, learning HR/bookkeeping/accounting/compliance/risk mngmt/leadership and the cost/time each entails, mistakes in hiring/pricing/policies/EMRs/risk mngmt/scheduling, overcoming and improving on her processes to avoid those same mistakes in the future, cost of property, marketing and advertising,  paying staff instead of herself probably during slow times and so MUCH more!!!  She is also taking a risk on bringing any practitioner or employee into a business she has built for 20 yrs. Her profit margin is not 50% if she pays you 50%. If the business runs on a 5-10% profit margin and she pays a % higher to her team, that's a significant loss in the margin, so as the CEO, that comes out of her CEO salary so to speak. The COST of Attraction, Aquisition and Retention has been Tens of thousands each year for 20 years in addition to overhead costs of admin, environment, etc. We, as a profession, are kind, good-willed humans, and we can be that while being a business owner also, which includes setting your boundaries on what it is worth to the owner to continue running the business. Referring patients out would be giving away her very hard earned Attraction and Aquisition potential to only to give it to someone else for their profit. There is a great likelihood that referring them to someone like a new Uncaged clinician, she will not get them back because that Uncaged member is going to do everything in their power to retain that client, right?  So then she would have worked for years on Attraction and Aquistion(the most costly for the owner) only to give the source of revenue to someone else. That first phone call can make or break a client, so that's the most important call, that's when you get the commitment from the client. For the same reason becoming Uncaged is risky, is the very reason she must work her numbers wisely. Imagine working diligently to get your schedule up to your first 10 clients, your max,  and having to give them to someone else for no return on investment to you. She has INVESTED 20 years of building trust and respect of the community!  Huge accomplishment! Congratulations to her!  Now you just have to decide if you want to be part of what she has already built or if you are ready/willing/capable of doing the same.   Either way, choose what is right for you. Respect the process. Even if you were to work with her and didn't appreciate the numbers, you may be able to learn lots just being involved in her system with your new frame of mind as a new business owner. The whole point, there's another side to the coin. Thanks for letting me share. Good luck no matter what you decide!

I’m always waiting for the IRS to knock on my door. “Well hello this is my kitchen office, this is my bedroom office, this is my family room office and this is my office office. Now will you help me put straws in these cups” 😂😂😂🫠 #HappyMonday ￼￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use my home address for my office address too. I was cleaning out my garage about a year ago and had a ton of old computer stuff to get rid of and also chemicals. So I loaded it up and headed to the dump. The guy nicely informed me that the minute I chose to claim my home office now my home was a business and I would normally have to pay per pound ... He was kind and let me dump for free ONCE. Saved my $500!

Ok, I got a bad review from someone that has never been our patient. It’s a fake review, likely orchestrated by a disgruntled ex-employee (yes, the one who was stealing patients to start her own clinic with). It’s not a HIPPA violation to respond saying that she’s not our patient, is it? Seems like a dumb question, but I just don’t want to make a misstep with this.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would say something like “I’m sorry you’re unhappy. As the owner, I wanted to look into it and don’t have a patient in our system by this name. Please reach out so we can discuss this” or something like that.

> **Response 2:** Bury it with good reviews! Your current clients will want to help you. Don’t be afraid to ask

I’ve been lurking here for a long time. I’ve had a private practice in addition to my university clinic practice for years.   This Fall, I found a great space and opened on January 4th.  I have an amazing team working with me. But I am scared.  Going from a business that did nothing but generate extra income to one that is currently hemorrhaging cash - is unnerving.  I know that once I’ve spent some money on marketing everything will be fine. But wow- this game is scary.

Hi everyone! Just looking for a shoulder to lean on at the moment. I’ve worked extremely hard to get where I’m at today. I’ve finally gotten the word out enough and a patient recommended I sit on a panel for a national organization to talk about my specialities treating pediatric spine conditions. I’m so pumped but my SO is being a buzzkill and says I’m wasting my time because I’m not getting paid for it but in my mind I’m on stage with leading experts with so many opportunities for networking and essentially presenting my cases that I feel would generate a large amount of patients/consultations. They are also doing free marketing in my mind saving me a ton of time! Anyone else struggle with family or partners who don’t understand the whole concept of free screenings, community service, talks, etc to generate patients? 😠

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In any business there are times you have to hustle and not get paid for it. I think that is what sets apart entrepreneurs from worker bees, entrepreneurs risk their time, money and energy for an opportunity. Non entrepreneurs will only work for $. If it doesn't hurt your relationship, you do you! Don't look for validation even from your SO.

> **Response 2:** This is a great opportunity and you are clearly excited about it! That's all you need to focus on. Not every minute of every thing you do in your profession has an immediate monetary return. Do your thing, be confident and enjoy the experience!

Is anyone using anything that is free (or close to) for documentation? I'm trying to keep start up costs minimal, but maybe then expand into something like Jane. So I'm thinking about using squares free version for scheduling and payments initially, but is there anything basic out there for the documentation (Google doc or word even). The only other thing I'd need is some consent forms, so if anyone has leads on that as well, I would be very greatful! Thanks uncaged community!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Healthie

> **Response 2:** Consider the long term goals for your practice. If growth is in your plan, then it may be more cost effective from a time management perspective to pay for an EMR platform now. Most will handle scheduling, billing, documentation, reports, template builds, super bills, etc. If you wait to make the swap once your business is busy you may not have the luxury of time to setup your EMR the way you want to. 

On that note, I locked in PTEverywhere at a deep discount before I had a single patient. I am so glad that I did. I was able to create templates, scheduling, billing when I had the time to do so and now have access to look back at financial reports and patient data to day 1. 

It cost $48/month. I am exclusively out of network.

I’m trying to decided between Hellonote & PT Everywhere for EMR; pros & cons (besides hellonote 1/2 price than other ) 

I will be a brick & mortar 1 PT cash based clinic for now beginning Jan 
Thanks for help!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PtEverywhere!! 😉

> **Response 2:** PT Everywhere user here in a 1 PT mostly cash-based clinic. They do have some nice features, namely their patient interface that lets the patient fill out intake paperwork ahead of time, but it's not intuitive. The platform in general is also kind of clunky. I can try to design eval or daily note templates, but when they get exported as a pdf (to send to physicians, worker's comp, etc), it gets un-formatted and difficult to decipher. They have a 'help' page, but it's just a huge document that is unsearchable - you have to literally scan through all the text to find the topic you're looking for, and even then, it's often just basic info that's not usable.  There are major issues with being able to see what documents I've emailed or faxed to varioius people, as there is no record of that at all, and there is also no way to save common recipients (so I have to fully enter fax numbers or email address for literally every document).    If I were doing it again, I would elect to use the cheaper option, as the patient interface ability is simply not worth it for me. Maybe if I had more time to figure out the program, I might be able to use some of the other features, but as it is, it just takes too many steps to write a note and get a legible copy and CMS1500 form over to payors.

I'm a mobile PT with a patient with very stubborn frozen shoulder.  Any good tips besides passive and active stretching?

Addendum: doing lots of mobs in all planes and dynamic functional reaching. Addressing scapula and TS and CS.  She received a cortisone shot last week.  Not able to do dry needling because I am in CA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree with RK in that it is more of a chemical/hormone problem most likely. 

The manual and Therex is great but it really just serves as theatrics until the body figures it out. 

I find that once my patients understand the reality that it isn’t dangerous and they should stop or avoid doing things, they tend to embrace the “it is what it is” attitude and do pretty well. 

I explain how exercise may acutely benefit the chemical environment, so it doesn’t matter what you do as long as you do something and do it frequently.

Hello everyone! I've officially started my in-home pediatric private practice this month (yay!!) and have been using Zelle for accepting payments. I now have a new patient who is "challenging" me on this and states they do not want to use Zelle because it is not HIPAA compliant. Can anyone help me with this?

I've deep dived the internet and there are random articles stating it is necessary to have HIPAA compliant payment methods and some other articles saying otherwise. I've finally found a more reliable source, but am still questioning myself on the proper/legal way to go about this.

https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/index.html
* if you look at the last paragraph of this link, I think it's clear that payment methods are exempt...however, I'm unsure if it's simply stating I don't need the signed BAA portion, but still need to be  "HIPAA compliant"?

In addition, the parents wants me to remove my privacy notice section stating I have permission to access their medical record and speak to their PCP; parents want it to be on a case-by-case basis. I don't mind changing the form for them, but would this cause issues in the future??

THANK YOU, this group has been extremely helpful in helping me start my business and feel more confident in it :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like a complicated client/parent. Challenging you etc. Tell them to pay you cash or check if they don't want to zelle you. Or get a credit card reader from PayPal or any other provider.

> **Response 2:** I'd be concerned about them not wanting you to speak with the child's physician. What if there is an issue that needs to be communicated? You would solely be reliant on the parents and you wouldn't know what was actually communicated.

**Success happens over nights - not overnight**

It is so easy to get bummed out or to feel like a failure when we see others doing great things in their practices.

Two things:

👉 I am willing to bet that when you see those wins, the intention is meant to motivate and inspire you.

👉 The subliminal message in those posts is: "*After a good period of busting my butt, being obedient to the process, and trusting the process, this has been the outcome... and you can do this, too!"*

You know those new music artists that suddenly bust onto the scene? They've actually been working on their craft for years. 

Those public speakers who captivate an audience? They have logged hours honing that skill.

An athlete who can perform a particular move with ease and grace has put in thousands upon thousands of reps to master it.

Clinic owners who are "crushing it" have gone through their own frustrations of rejections.

If you are struggling, then ask: How are you struggling?  Where is the block?

In our experience, it is one of three things:

👉 Their Identity has not been defined

👉 They struggle with conversations (due to #1)

👉 All of the above

"Overnight" success is achieved when we enjoy the journey to getting there.

Keep taking steps.

The UNCAGED team and myself are cheering for you.

Tax Prep!
Is it ok to do your own taxes?  Is Turbo Tax good enough for a small LLC?  Tell me the pros and cons.  I know it’s last minute.  I was about to upload all my info to a CPA but then I figured I might as well do it myself.  I am the only employee with basically a side hustle income.  Thanks for your input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just a quick back story. I'm from a farm and have helped my parents with tax prep for many years but they always went to a CPA to put it all together. I thought I knew everything.

This year, I decided to do it on my own. Last year was the first year of my PT business. I also had a W-2 and another small business. I just received the biggest return of my life... I mean huge. All because I used TurboTax, learned the system, and studied the rules on the IRS website. 

Teach a man to fish as they say. Some CPAs are amazing. However, most of them just collect your info and submit. They don't have time to go through all the potential write offs and holes. My GF was about to submit hers last week. I calculated it and she initially owed $750. After I was done, she received a $1600 refund. I learned all of that info from doing mine this year.

> **Response 2:** We just paid $900 to have ours done. We have 2 very small LLCs (just us). I think I might return to Turbo Tax!

Haven't ever worked in ortho, but try to keep up my ortho knowledge best I can. My 80 year old dad who hikes everyday injured his back pulling out finished plants from the garden and now can't walk without a walker. Sent him to an ortho PT and was told If disc is ruptured he would need surgery. This is different from what I remember learning. 
So my question is: 1) Do you see pts who need surgery for a ruptured disc?
2) effective exercises when everything is painful?
SI joint correction brings mild relief that doesn't last. Unable to perform meaningful extension standing or prone due to pain. Flexion worse than extension. Feels best on back with legs raised or on side with a pillow under top leg. 
Went from a painful back to not walking in a week. I would have expected him to get better not worse over the week. 
Thanks for your responses.
Edited to add: Positioning, distraction, and NSAIDs minimally helpful,  but still helpful.  
Pain radiates down right leg to outside of ankle. Constant ache back of thigh,  top quarter.
Getting a Rx for imaging since he is a Medicare recipient and doctor referral required for imaging.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would definitely get imaging for compression fracture. With these patients, very gentle mfr around area, core stabilization (hip isos), gentle sh extension with bands and focusing on stabilization stabilization stabilization. No ROM until fracture cleared. Usually with that their pain goes down but need to clear fracture before doing ROM.

> **Response 2:** Thank you for all the responses.  Positioning, distraction and NSAIDs minimally helpful, but still helpful. Getting a Rx for imaging since he is a Medicare recipient and requires a physician rx. Truly appreciate the insights.

For those of you who don't know me, yet - I am Kalyca! I work closely with Josh Payne, David Bayliff, and Kevin DeGroot at Uncaged Clinician. 

Over the past two weeks I've had the incredible honor of sitting in on our bi-annual Board Meeting Calls. These are something we do twice a year with each one of our Mastermind Students. 
The goal of these calls is to check-in, vision-cast, and better understand how we can truly show-up and support each individual business owner. 

I recognized something REALLY awesome yesterday that I wanted to share with the whole group...

If you know Josh, David, and Kevin ... you probably already admire them for their modesty and humility. All three of them often say the phrase, "it's not about me"... in reference to how IT IS all about each of our coaching students and IT IS about how we can serve them and care for them to the best of our ability.

Since they would never say this about themselves... I'll open up my loud mouth and share what I've witnessed. Watching them show up over and over and over again for every single one of our students is nothing short of REMARKABLE. 

They are so uniquely talented in recognizing what each person needs, articulating it in a supportive way, and truly serving from their heart so that each person can leave the call with their cup filled in just the right way. The manner through which they intuit this is actually pretty mind blowing to witness...

Support can come in many forms ... sometimes a gentle push, a shoulder to literally cry on, or an accountability partner. These guys always seem to know exactly what each person needs. 
Witnessing this gift in each of them makes me feel energized by how much they are living into their purpose. 

If ever you find yourself wishing you had this level of support... you should certainly consider seeking mentorship from these three... in my completely unbiased opinion 🙃😏🤣!

In my post from today, multiple people asked me to share **my top 5 books** that I've read of all time that were valuable in me growing in business.

Overall, before I get into it I must say that there is no other book that has impacted me more as an entrepreneur than the Bible (Read Proverbs if you don't believe me 😄) . It is packed with useful knowledge that God has laid out to help us to realize how to run effective businesses in the marketplace. 

These are the FIVE OTHER books that I have read that have made the biggest impact on me and our businesses. I'm also going to share what its helpful for as well. I believe strongly in reading a specific book with a specific goal in mind. This requires us to know ourselves, know our businesses, and be self-aware enough to know what needs to be worked on in the business. 

Here we go! (in no particular order)
1. Marketing and Selling: ***Book Yourself Solid* by Michael Port**.

It's a classic that I still come back to. I've read all the modern books out there on marketing, and this is the one with principles that are tried and true. 

2. Finances in Business: ***Profit First* by Mike Michalowicz**. 

Simple method to get your finances under control, and to save you years of headaches with your finances. 

3. Mindset specific for entrepreneurs: ***Gap Or The Gain* by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy. **

It will radically shift your perspective of how to think as a business owner. 

4. Managing and understanding your team/people: **6 Types of Working Genius by Patrick Lencioni**. 

Incredible book and testing system to understand how each person on your team plays a part in the overall function of the company. 

5. Scaling a business: ***Traction* by Gino Wickman. **

I read this book too early as a solopreneur from a recommendation from a friend and I really wasn't able to grasp the importance. When reading it years later, it was profound. The right book at the wrong time isn't very helpful. The right book at the right time can work wonders in a business. If you aren't in a position to scale yet, I wouldn't suggest reading it until you are (just my opinion). 

Hope this is helpful to you! 👊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Woah and I actually missed a sixth one that has made a massive impact on Uncaged Clinician as a whole: The Carpenter by John Gordon. Incredible book that teaches the most impactful values that a business can have!

> **Response 2:** I think it depends most on what hinders your growth which can vary from person to person.  My most impactful books to date have all to do with personal growth and mindset.  

Just shedding some light for us outliers out there 🙋🏾‍♀️❤️

Hey all! Starting my own PT clinic and wondering what software you all recommend… I am taking insurance. ￼￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Currently using the WebPT with Therabill integrated with it. Pro’s EMR is simple, made for PT’s; supposedly ease of billing from note to therabill. But there are some hiccups; easy Filled CMS forms printed if needed. WebPT is good if you are planning to have more than 3 clinicians and multiple locations.

Con’s: customer service on both parties are a hit and miss, but more miss on my end; prices on webpt are ala carte, a little bit higher premium on price but worth it for the ease of documentation.

> **Response 2:** I love Prompt ❤️.  It saves so much time not having to log in to multiple systems (clearinghouse) and makes everything accurate because of that.

Give me ideas of 15-20 minute treatments to compliment a doctors Botox, skincare party. Thinking about tagging along and offering manual, dry needling, cupping, etc. Heather Cascio Flexer Kim Hazelton Santi Villamil

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What am I ChatGPT?

> **Response 2:** Facial cupping and lymphatic work. I know in the past it has to be before Botox though so you don’t spread it around. 

I also have natural serums and a skincare line that i would be offering in addition to their Botox treatment to improve results. You might want to consider adding this if you plan on following around with Botox parties regularly

Okay, so, real talk. I'm feeling defeated, desperate and overwhelmed with the therapy world and really want to dive into this thing - but I'm terrified.

I am currently 26 weeks pregnant and my husband was recently traumatically injured in a work accident on 4/26/23 where he will be off work for an extended time (he lost 2 fingers and will need multiple surgeries for his two remaining).

In your opinion, is this feasible given my circumstances to dive in now? Or, would you wait until after baby is here? Just needing some real life advice I guess. I know there are many contingencies.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m sorry to hear of your husband’s accident. Maybe this is not the time to dive into a new project or make big changes or decisions, take care of yourself and your baby, help your husband and revisit the concept of job or career changes after you recover from childbirth

> **Response 2:** No question for me, wait! Get settled in new baby world, let someone pay some maternity leave as you set up your business. Also, don't let crazy pregnancy hormones rule your decisions or how you interact with your new clients. What if you go 10 weeks early? What would you do, you aren't set up, etc. Get excited and planned...that's my real world advice. Life will be challenging for the next few months, after that, dive in. While there's no perfect time, this doesn't seem like anywhere close to the right time based on the info you provided.

What tips do you have for staying positive after you get a string of calls who all immediately ask about insurance then want to check with insurance before booking?

I'm doing fine in my biz so I know I shouldn't take it personally, but man I get so tired of having to explain insurance over the phone and then having people not book when I know I can help them!

I know this is the bane of every cash-based provider's existence so just looking for a little solidarity and tips on staying positive! Thanks friends!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I usually start off with a “tell me what’s going on” intro.  if they are really focused on me answering that question first I will tell them that “I am not in network with any insurance is followed by but tell me what’s going on.”  I try to get them talking about their problem to create some investment on both of our parts.  The conversation at least goes a lot smoother versus just ending with a no. At the very least the person has told me their story and they know that I’m interested in seeing them. No one likes to tap to tell their story twice so it gives me an advantage.

> **Response 2:** “Do you want to work with your insurance, or do you want to work with me?” If they were a warm lead from a recommendation that tends to help. Also my google reviews are good so I’ll point out the difference between my reviews and others. If they are set on using their insurance then I flip right into a mode of being very helpful about where to go (you usually know the good clinics or clinicians in town). At least then I’ve won them over down the road if they don’t like the in network experience. It’s that mindset shift that stops me from getting bummed out

I also set a reminder to call back in a few days. I’ve gotten someone that way because the in network places were talking deductible and they read some reviews. Oh and they could t get an appointment for 3 weeks. Fortune is in the follow up

Hi everyone, 
I'm an OT who is planning on doing cash pay only on the side. Couple questions.
-Am I good to call it wellness services and see patients without a referral? 
-Am I in violation of any laws by doing so?
-OT is not direct access but does that matter if I'm not providing OT but am instead providing wellness?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What kind of services are you going to provide?

> **Response 2:** Do yourself a favor and review your practice act and ch 15 of Medicare benefits manual, so you have a clear understanding of the rules. You cannot have Medicare patients private pay for services that that would be considered skilled and medically necessary.  There are also the maintenance therapy rules which again, need to be skilled and medically necessary, but generally is not on a consistent basis unless you have a complex case and can justify the ongoing need for skilled care. Self pay for Medicare patients would be only for services not covered by Medicare.

Letter from Medicare stating we bill more  therex than our counterparts ....  I'm not sure what to think ...  what else are you to bill besides therex as a PT OT.... I could see if it was all Neuro or an Therapeutic activities that is billed higher .... 
...the letter stated for us to look into our billing practices in the next 6 months 

Thoughts on this ....

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The best way to avoid audits is to diversify your billing.  Any exercise can be billed under any type of code, it all depends on why you’re doing an exercise.

Straight leg raise = ther act if you’re prescribing it to help the pt get their leg in bed 

SLR = neuro if regaining quad and hip flexor cocontraction. 

SLR = ther ex if doing it purely for strengthening. (Generally though, aren’t you strengthening something so the patient can DO things?) 

I bill ther ex the least because I’m usually prescribing an exercise to have the patient regain a specific task.  It also bills the least.

> **Response 2:** A lot of therex is them telling you that you aren't focusing enough on function, which is all that medicare wants to pay for

Hi everyone! 👋 I’m a mobile outpatient PT located in Texas. I started a group called Rehab Professionals of Texas (PT, OT, SLP) to help make it easier for PTs, OTs and SLPs in Texas to refer to and connect with other clinicians in the state. 

I don’t benefit financially from people joining - it just  makes it easier for me to refer patients to other clinicians in the state. I got tired of not having good recommendations for patients that were moving or asking me about referrals for friends and family. So if you’re in Texas please come join us (and invite your Texas rehab friends) and help me grow the network!

The beauty of the "uncaged life" is being able to say: "I don't treat/specialize in that, but I would be happy to provide you with the contact information of someone who I think would be a great fit to help you" 

There was a time when I felt so pressured to take cases that I just  wasn't confident treating...even though a clinician better suited for the case was often in the same clinic 😖

It honestly makes me so happy to have the resources to refer to clinicians that I KNOW are a better fit than I am :) 

Happy for this group that has opened my eyes to this  AND introduced me to great clinicians in my state and other states!

Help! I am starting a mobile side business in CA. I just opened an S-Corp as we can’t do an LLC here. When meeting with my accountant for personal taxes he told me it was crazy to open an S-Corp prior to having 60/80 K in profit and I should just be a sole proprietor. He recommends that I un-incorporate as s-corps are extra steps and expensive in CA. I did the s-corp so my personal assets are protected but he insisted that a good insurance would cover that. This is against any and all recommendations that I have received. Any thoughts/recs??? I am so irritated about the prospect of starting the process over as I am just about ready to start accepting clients! Thank you in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Regardless of what your CPA says, you as a PT can establish ONLY an S-Corp in CA. The CPA may not be aware of that

> **Response 2:** I actually don't think any of the below answers are correct. You don't HAVE to be an s-corp because s-corp is a tax designation entity. It has nothing to do with the structure of your business. Physical Therapy practices cannot be LLCs in California but individuals can elect to be either a sole proprietor or professional corporation. All professional corporations in California are registered as c-corps initially but can file form 2553 to become an s-corp. The benefits of an s-corp is that taxation is passed on to the shareholder (you if you're the only owner of this corporation) instead of being taxed at the corporate level as well. I don't know the full scope of how profit levels might affect how this pans out but I can say from personal experience that it's fine if you have yours designated as an s-corp. But at the end of the day, consult with another trusted CPA if you want sound advice for your specific circumstance.

**Original Post:**
“How much should I pay my employees?”

This is always a question that I’m fascinated by the answers people respond with. 

Without outright saying it the general consensus is to pay what you can get away with. To squeeze profits out of employees. 

If you’re a business owner, how’d that work out for you when you were working for someone else? They squeezed you for as much profit as they could get and you felt burnt out, frustrated, taken advantage of, disrespected and more.

And that’s the answer that we’re going to go with when we run a business? To take advantage of the next generation of therapists who don’t know better?

I just heard a quote that trauma that’s unhealed is repeated. Let’s be a part of breaking the cycle not repeating it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** All of this is true. You need to pay them their worth and you also need to make sure you’re making at least 20-25% profit. You can’t just look at reimbursement related to pay to your contractor. As a business owner, you have other overhead to consider: EMR, rent, supplies and most importantly, risk. Be fair to them and be fair to yourself. A business that breaks even is not a business.

> **Response 2:** Good discussion point and very timely,  as I'm offering full time positions,  lol. I always felt that when I had a business,  I would pay fairly, and  better as the business did well. I also like the idea of base pay, but opportunity to earn more by doing more.  
Since you started the discussion,  I would love to hear others' ideas of pay, benefits and other rewards that keep employees engaged and happy.

It seems like “coaching” is completely unregulated. Why should I continue to fight insurance companies on reimbursement for CPT codes and to network for referrals from MD’s who don’t really value what I do? I’m in one of the 3 states with no direct access for a PT. Why not just become a “coach” and “train” people with a rehab/therapy mindset? Essentially be strictly Wellness. Surely I can find a masseuse to work with to offer manual/soft tissue services.

I’m obviously not in a professional crisis AT ALL…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s a tricky! I’m an OT in same place. I’m doing educational consulting/coaching for families but very low key. I want to expand but am worried

> **Response 2:** If I remember correctly there were some PTs in Texas that tried this. They were punished because they were held to the "limitations of their highest license". Essentially they were PTs with personal trainer Certs "training" people. They were in violation of direct access laws because the grey area was deemed to lean towards therapy and not wellness. So be careful with all your notes and wording you use. I'm not the extent of the punishment, but it was mentioned on a Jarod Carter podcast.

I’d love to say I’m just nosy but I’m really just curious. What are your clinic’s (or clinics’) average units billed per session?? Mine from 2022 Mobile 3.44 brick and mortar 3.42

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Right at 4 mobile. 3.9 I think. 

Some 5 unit visits (evals, longer tx times for higher level pts) get offset by 1-2 unit visits when tolerance is low, pt having an off day, etc when tx cut short.

> **Response 2:** I’m pretty consistently billing 4 units for standard treatment. I cant justify driving out to a clients home to do 3 units. I do 55/60 min treatments because i can only do time math by 5 mins LOL obviously it will vary. sometimes it’s 3 units, really really rarely is it 2 units and at that point I’m telling the pt to cancel if they can’t do a full session of therapy (24+ hour notice). I have some maintenance Geris but mostly younger athletic groups though.

**Original Post:**
If your a therapist, You MUST read  this book & read this chapter first (in the pic) to see the profound correlations￼ between ethical fading in all areas of business and the REHAB world. 

I will share public on my personal business page if you want to share! 

I summarized the chapter below putting all my (therapy correlations in parentheses)

CHAPTER 8: Ethical fading:￼ When structure replaces leadership

-the infinite game means to run a business with no end goal, just help advance humanity and help people. 
-The finite game means to run a business always looking to win, reach a goal, quota, number, productivity percentage￼
-if ethical fading can happen where integrity is taken really seriously, like the military, then it can happen anywhere! And it does! 
-if you Create processes, check boxes, quotas or productivity percentages to be reached, they will always will tell us what we want to hear, but it may not be telling us the truth
-when leaders choose to implement processes and demands (like productivity rather than clinical judgment), The opportunity for systemic ethical fading persist, especially if these demands are not only unreasonable but are OUTRIGHT impossible. 
-pressure comes from the top down (director of rehab telling you what to do) but also pressure comes from the bottom up (in an effort to stand out, new grads/those looking for a raise/brown nosers want to appear they can do everything, so they work off the clock or provide fraudulent therapy to reach productivity) and a failure to do these bad things makes others look bad. Submitting a false report helps the system run smoothly and keeps their careers on track. Because the punishment for being honest is greater than for Lies, (therapist) feel they have to lie or cheat to meet the requirements placed upon them. It’s a catch 22. They will do this while believing that their high moral standards have remained uncompromised. They don’t see this as unethical or lying, they see it as part of the bureaucratic process of checking the boxes, just doing what leader ship wanted them to do. 
-When these seemingly minor transgressions become pervasive in a culture, it is a sign of ethical fading!
-the irony is that when we apply finite related solutions to address a problem of ethical fading, that finite minded thinking created, we get more ethical fading. When we use processes and structure to fix cultural problems, we get more lying and cheating, then the behavior becomes normalized. 
-calling someone a lazy leader is not calling them a bad person just like calling someone a lazy person who doesn’t want to exercise doesn’t mean they’re a bad person. Their decisions are often very well intended. They actually believe these demands are going to be helpful but because leadership never experiences these demands they’re oblivious to the problems they create. 
-More structure is not the answer! 
-ethical fading  is a People problem and we need PEOPLE to correct a People problem
-THE ANSWER is an infinite mind set
-leaders who give their staff a just cause to advance, and give them a trusting TEAM, Will build a culture in which their people can work toward the STG while staying ethical, NOT because they are told to, NOT because they have a checklist that requires it, NOT because they took the companies online course, they did it because it’s the natural human thing to do. 
-my input…
-leadership should let their SNF therapists know that if they let their productivity dip below 90% because it was ethically correct to take time to talk to a family member or doctor which is non-productive time, the company may not have enough money to support raises or other employee request this year but if they also support the just cause of “ let’s help our seniors age in place and keep them as mobile and healthy as we possibly can” by selling more 1:1 gym training or wellness programs, we can fund more employee request! Now if your higher ups and COEs are making millions or billions, THATS A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is 💯💯💯 . I love Simon Sinek

> **Response 2:** I’m starting to wonder if people are ignoring their ￼ moral compass

I am in the process of starting my own mobile practice. I will be the only employee. Are there others like me on this group? If so, any advice would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 🙋‍♀️ you are going to get a lot of really great advice from a therapy perspective and a therapy business perspective on this page. I also work with a SCORE mentor (it's a free program across the country that links you up with someone in your city who can mentor you for starting a small business). I have found it really helpful for non-therapy, but state specific stuff. They will help you write a business plan, they will look at your books to help you figure out where to be more profitable. They will teach you where free resources are (like market analyses on the local library website). Mine happened to have mentored another OT in the past, so I was able to connect with others to network. It's been very beneficial along with the great support from the mentors here!

> **Response 2:** Me!  Been on my own for two years now and I haven’t regretted one second of it. I say use groups like this to get ideas but make sure you do your own research as well. Some well meaning people may give wrong info or things that maybe only pertain to their state etc…
Good luck!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I used Raintree previously and loved it. It’s a bit complex when you first learn, but you can template so much and it makes it great. It has by far my favorite flow sheet for exercises. 

I’ve also used Prompt and it is very easy and documentation was fast on it. They are very responsive and our billing department loved them.

> **Response 2:** We like hellonote for documentation. But I have to say they absolutely SUCK at getting you set up. I mean we were 6 months in and having to call them about stupid stuff. Very frustrating

I hired a new grad who found out last night that she failed her licensure exam.  She has already moved to Charlotte so she could start working here as soon as she got her license.  I can’t really hire her full time until she can start seeing patients except for a few things such as putting together workshops, shockwave, etc.
Do any of you have things she can do remotely to help you out to earn some money?  She will re-test in January.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Unfortunately, I don’t have work for her. I just wanted to say that you’re demonstrating the type of leadership we need in corporate America!  While you’re not obligated to find her temporary work, you are assisting her with it.  I wish more employers cared about their people like this. 

I wish her good luck on the exam!

> **Response 2:** I made way more money waitressing evenings & studying for the exam during the day when I was a new grad compared to when I worked as an aide for the experience/resume builder.

Hi! I originally built my own website on godaddy and it needs an upgrade. My business is doing well and my consultant recommended I use a website marketer who specializes in OT/PT. This is great but it costs $4000. The idea is that it will get more google referrals with all the fancy stuff they can do for SEO, etc. 

Can anyone attest that it was worth paying that much for a website?

Thank you!! I am struggling with this decision and need some opinions!

**edit- I’m not looking to rebuild it myself on a different platform. I need to outsource and want to know how much I should be paying for this service.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Me too Amy! I built mine on GoDaddy and have been considering hiring someone to update it and change it to Wordpress. Have not bit the bullet yet!

**Original Post:**
Apologies in advance for the long post but I need some advice/guidance…

I am a PTA that left my private practice job to go out on my own. I’m working the “grey” areas by getting my personal training certification and using my background in PT to market more experience and to more of the clientele that I’m used to, such as balance/neuro/general strengthening etc. My clients are ones that were unable to continue PT due to insurance or being d/c due to lack of progress, but all with hx of progressive diseases.

My question is, I’m doing documentation as I normally would but with different wording as a CPT, I’m keeping track of mileage, receipts, checks, and making initial agreement forms. I have a waiver and liability form but I have no idea if it’s written the way I need it to. I’m not sure if I have too much or too little as far as covering for taxes and getting everything together. I don’t have an account (too new, not enough income) and I do my taxes through turbo tax mostly. Do I have everything? Is there a certain way to do some of this so it’s easier?  It feels a bit overwhelming starting your own business and I’m not sure if I have everything I need in place.

Feel free to send me a message if that’s easier. Thanks in advance everyone!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Let me say this, don't get hung up on your PTA license, because you can't legally practice PT without a PT setting a POC right? As long as you aren't caliming to be offering PT services, legally you are fine. At least where I live, you are now providing wellness services.
You cannot turn the PTA knowledge part of your brain off, use it to help your clients. You can market your years experience in the field, that's perfectly fine, its true information. You can't offer PT services, that is true. The services you'll be offering will be wellness. Wellness is a huge umbrella that you can work under. Stay licensed!
I have a PTA friend (still maintains her license) that went out on her own and offered STOTT pilates (she is certified)...she now has 2 studios and several employees. She can't not use her PTA knowledge when addressing issues for her clients. She uses it all the time. Legally she isn't providing PT. 
Also, I think you should document as you see fit for helping your clients, and keep track of your expenses and mileage like a normal business of any kind. 
That's my take on things for what it's worth.
Good luck on your new journey!😊

> **Response 2:** Here is a thought if you are growth minded.  Find a PT that may also have mutual interests in the areas you are trying to impact ( patient type, niche,etc….) and function as a PTA along with wellness types of services that you offer. It may sound overwhelming but it sounds like you’re already doing some heavy lifting in your current business endeavor.  Nothing big to start, maybe a PT that is looking for a side hustle. You may be surprised how appealing your business sounds to a PT that may be looking for more flexibility of schedule , smaller scale and functioning outside the more traditional models out there.  I know this does not address your questions in regards to needs of operations but just a thought.

**Original Post:**
For those who have started their own mobile and/or cash based business. Do you feel that there is a need for years of experience before doing so or is it more about just doing it?

Sometimes I feel that if I am going to charge cash rates that I need to have a couple of extra skills like dry needling and/or manipulations so that I provide more than just the average PT.

Or is it just providing that amazing customer service. What really is the thing?…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I remember a therapist telling me exactly this. “Work for 5 years. Develop your skills and make connections. Then go on your own.”

Total BS. 

You can hire experience instead of waiting to gain it. 

In a cash model people aren’t buying the commodity of PT. They are buying “The Experience” not YOUR experience. 

Every year you spend not doing things that move you toward your goal is a year driving in the wrong direction.

> **Response 2:** This is a great question 🙂 and I’m going to say what I think you need to hear, maybe not what you want to hear. 

I’ve got 3 thoughts that I think will be helpful:

Most people will consider clinical skill, personal growth and finances, so let’s tackle them. 

1.  You need clinical mentorship, always. In a busy clinic sometimes you can’t actually get that anyway….sometimes you can.

Just be honest about what you specialize in. 

The problem comes when I see someone say “I’m a chronic pain specialist “ or “I’m the ankle guy” 

When they haven’t taken any CEUs in that content. 

There is a difference between interest and mastery.

With that said, I have 3 clinical mentors, 2 business mentors and my own business with a speciality in pelvic floor concerns and sexual wellness. I also offer mentorship in this arena. 

With either option, make your circle full of people that inspire you, it’s worth every penny. 

My meetings with my clinical mentors are by far my favorite day of the week. 

Truly understanding your clients and knowing how to help them is wayyy more valuable than any manipulation or dry needling course.

People buy from you because you can give them a result, that’s the important stuff. 

👏👏Again because this topic gets me fired up: People invest thousands of dollars and their time in life altering results , not any single modality. That’s where our gold is. 🙂

Your question made me pause because this ☝️is really important for everyone 🙂

I can sum up all my advice in that one sentence and will forever stand by it. 

Being able to say “I love helping this person get this result and I’m really fucking good at it” is a prerequisite to be successful  imo. I’m curious, do you feel this way about a specific population? 

If you’re choosing between a first year job that offers clinical mentorship with someone you admire and your own business, I’d choose the mentorship. 

If you’re choosing a shitty factory job and your own business, I’d choose your business. 

2. The other problem here is if you don’t  know who you are clinically yet. 

Some people finish school thinking “I love acute care” and end up working in and loving pediatrics. 

It’s never a rush and I think giving yourself time to explore and try many jobs for a few years can be helpful if you aren’t sure about who your ideal client is. 

The beauty of having your own business is being able to help the people that you best serve and enjoy helping. 

I think it’s helpful to have an idea of who that is first and jumping around in this way is harder as a business owner. 

It’s helpful for you so that you love your business and life in the future. 🙂 

3. Financial. 

Let’s not discredit this elephant in the room. My first few years working for someone else, I was miserable, thought about quitting daily and made $30-$35 an hour. 

Now I’m a business of 1, today I have 4 dream clients and I make $20-30k a month. Hearing those numbers, sounds super tempting especially if you owe massive amounts of student debt, as I did. 

My advice here is that, if you already know you are entrepreneurial. You will be successful and you will earn that income. It’s a matter of timing. 

It will happen, so it doesn’t have to happen today. Someone that says it does, might be trying to sell you something 🙂 

Starting a business is a huge emotional investment, at least it has been for me. You will suprise yourself and be so much more successful than you ever dreamed. Give yourself the gift of the process. 

It’s a lot more fun when you have an idea of who you are clinically, what you LOVE to do and support in place. 

It will happen, so it doesn’t have to happen yesterday.  🙂

Hope this helps

Is it possible to sell your hybrid practice if you are the only clinician, a 3 year old clinic with 100+ google reivews a good profit margin and revenue of 15-18k a month in a growing city and building is in s good location

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My understanding is that a business is more attractive when the money coming in has nothing to do with you (e.g. others generate your revenue). The buyer tends not to care about things like Google reviews, novelty of practice, etc., they just care about the EBITDA. Even after selling, the buyer will likely expect you to be part of the practice for 18+ months to transition and get established. That's just based on one conversation I had with a broker. My practice has several employees, so maybe it's different for a solo practice.

> **Response 2:** At one point I was just curious what my business was worth so I had someone that buys similar businesses look at mine. The #1 thing they said is, can the business survive if me/the owner wasn't around and is the brand recognition solely built around me. If it relies heavily on the owner, there is much less value then a practice with other therapists. Having contracts with referral partners helps build value as well

most common thing heard over the last week from clients- thank you for helping me build what I want to build and not forcing me to believe that I could only be successful if I build a massive business. 

Part of what being UNCAGED is about is not falling victim to the mind cancer that convinces so many that they'll only be enough when they hit certain revenue targets.

For anyone who is self-employed, who do you use for health insurance? I gave up full-time benefits at my previous job to pursue my own business, but I need health insurance for myself and my three kids. Not sure where to start or what insurance carrier doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Christian Healthcare Ministries. It’s a cost sharing plan, but has been phenomenal. Case I’m point…my labrum repair with BCBS cost me nearly $8000 in ADDITION to premiums that were close to $1000/mo for the 3 of us. Clavicle repair in 2019 with CHM cost me $0 with premiums of about $400-450/month for us 3. Wife got tossed from her horse and literally landed on her head resulting in just a concussion thank goodness, but also a $35K ER bill. Again we paid $0. You pay OOP for routine stuff, but well worth it imo.

> **Response 2:** We use Medi share! We pay 400 a month for a family plan with 8k family “deductible”. A local direct primary care doctor told me about Zion as well, which is a sharing program but is not faith based in nature.

**Original Post:**
Win and Lesson!

I started with the idea of having a mobile physical therapy practice, just me, resigned to the idea that I will likely have to rely on Medicare payment as my source of income, because people in my area won't want to pay cash for my services. This would limit my earning potential as I can only see so many people in a day and Medicare will only pay so much, but as long as I can replace my corporate job paycheck, it will be good enough.

I found out about the Uncaged Clinician coaching program and thought, "Well that sounds great, but there is no way I can afford to pay for that and recoup the cost considering the (perceived) ceiling of my income." And, I will admit, I'm on the cheap side when it comes to paying for things, so the program seemed very cost-prohibitive for me. Not.gonna.do.it.

I was willing to talk to [Keghan Crossland](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252761052764366/user/548311312/?__cft__[0]=AZU8HqJlgHPyNxm4L0VPPL86p49te_ONVgpLnPiR1ZngfgvYZ7p7A8aVIhDX_lW2cAfOPdZ2n3r1CiE4NOfORoZjRax5x8UdbU_pRJ94lVpKVlelx_Dd48IJbyyFYrBwjb1miO5IM9jGlUFwPNP4dkeE&__tn__=-]K-R), though, because you know, *free.* He then told me that I should at least do a growth strategy call with [David Bayliff](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252761052764366/user/1269938479/?__cft__[0]=AZU8HqJlgHPyNxm4L0VPPL86p49te_ONVgpLnPiR1ZngfgvYZ7p7A8aVIhDX_lW2cAfOPdZ2n3r1CiE4NOfORoZjRax5x8UdbU_pRJ94lVpKVlelx_Dd48IJbyyFYrBwjb1miO5IM9jGlUFwPNP4dkeE&__tn__=-]K-R). I mean, I'm still not going to pay for the program, but, what the heck, it's *free.*

So, I talked to David, and then...I started to really see the value of the program...that this *could* be an investment in myself to grow a business bigger than what I originally thought. "Am I just drinking the Kool-aid," I thought? It's still a lot of money. Money that I don't currently have. But I was seriously considering it.

Then I had the opportunity to reach out and speak to someone went through the program and started her own successful mobile PT practice.  She graciously and generously answered my business related questions and also shared her experience with the Uncaged Clinician coaching program...and that sealed the deal.  And so now, I am officially a member of the Uncaged Clinician Pathway program!

So the lesson here: I was not interested in paying for this program at all, BUT, after learning more about it, I was able to realize the value that it offers me. So now I am working on changing my mindset. There are people out there that will not be interested in paying cash for my services, BUT if I can show them the value it provides to them, I just might change their minds like I changed my mind.

And there is the power of word of mouth. I mean, while I was very interested in the program after talking to David, it still felt like a lot of money. But after talking to someone who experienced it and valued it (someone that I didn't even know), I felt good about committing myself to the program.

So here I am, so excited to be a part of the program and for the possibilities that await. Let's GOOOO!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** SO. MUCH. VALUE. HERE.

Thank you for sharing, Jill Raibley Howery!!!

> **Response 2:** I love how you’re already applying this to your future customers and gaining insight. 

Gaining trust and demonstrating value takes time and a few touch points — and that’s ok. 

I have a hunch you’re going to blow your initial expectations for your business out of the water! 👏🏼

Taping experts:

6’6” 16 yo with negative MRI
Negative X-ray

Swelling and pain BETWEEN the border of the fibular  head and knee joint line Anterior

Lidocaine into tib fib joint decreased pain and swelling 

Swells and pain only with weight bearing activities 

Only swells to a point and pain to a point…never worse after 10 min of weight bearing

Need to stabilize AP tib fib …and decrease pistoning of fibula which seems to be the big problem 

Also considering a compression pad as swelling and injection seemed to stabilize some.

Thoughts…???

**Community Responses:**

Hey guys….just curious about those of you having someone doing your social media marketing.  Wondering when you typically saw an ROI.  I’m just having someone do IG/FB with some FB boosts and 3 emails a month to my email list.  IG followers have doubled, biz page fb interaction has gone up but no new clients.  Getting a little tired of spending so much money.  But maybe I just need to be more patient or switch tactics.  What have u guys found to work best?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Social media marketing is the hard way to get new patients.  Focus on you past patient list.  Next to 0 money and will get you way more new patients than cold lead marketing on social media

> **Response 2:** Lead gen is, as Ray said, most profitable through past patients. Do your have a digital app that connects you quickly with all of your discharged patients? Even sending a Thinking of You note can re engage them and /or get referrals to their friends and family.

Started writing my book!!! So exciting. See below for my intro 
👇🏼
The title is “Don’t Buy the Minivan”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a single mom of two daughters, I knew I had to work hard to make ends meet. But at the same time, I didn't want to miss out on the important moments in my daughters' lives. I wanted to be there for every sporting event, every school play, and every milestone. I wanted to be the kind of mom who could drop off and pick up her kids from school every day.

 

So, when my oldest daughter, just shy of nine years old at the time, suggested that I start my own healthcare business, I was skeptical at first. How could I possibly juggle the demands of running a business with the demands of being a mom? But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that entrepreneurship might actually be the key to achieving my goals.

 

With my daughters by my side, I embarked on a journey that was both challenging and rewarding. I learned how to balance the demands of work and family, and I discovered that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. I was able to attend all my daughters' events, drop them off and pick them up from school every day, and still build a successful healthcare business.

 

This book is my story of being a single mom and entrepreneur. It's about the challenges I faced, the lessons I learned, and the joys of being able to create a life that worked for me and my family. It's about the importance of prioritizing what truly matters and finding a way to make it work.

 

If you're a single mom who is struggling to balance work and family, or if you're an aspiring entrepreneur who wants to learn from someone who has been there, then this book is for you. It's a story of hope, inspiration, and possibility. So, join me on this journey, and let's discover together what it means to create a life that truly works for us and our families.

> **Response 2:** Nice intro
Very inspiring

What is your favorite patient rejection reason of the year?

Got my first "They don't want you back" rejection of 2024 (that I know of). The patient had hip surgery and is coming home. The daughter told my friend that "My PTA and I talked too much and didn't do enough work." 

Umm, that's because we were trying to talk them into doing the basics that would prevent them from needing surgery in the first place.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a notoriously difficult pt (OP sports) who really wanted her problem to be that she was tight rather than weak 🤷‍♀️ She resisted strengthening even though she really wanted to get back to tennis, so I tried to blend some stretching with a lot of education and gradual increase on the strengthening exercises. Eventually she came in and said:

"This isn't working. I don't come in here for YOUR EMPATHY."

🤯😂

Ok, pal. You go on with your bad self. Wish you all the luck in the world.

> **Response 2:** Unpopular opinion...
Perception is reality is tough to hear. Even if you are right, it didn't come across to the client in a way they could, or were willing to understand.  It's our choice if we want to Self improve so we can reach those difficult ones, or just stick to the easy ones. 
Sometimes,  it just won't work, and that's OK too. But after 32 years of practicing,  most of the time I can get my message across and they can benefit.  If not, refer out to someone else they may "hear" better from.

There is a chiropractor in town that advertises on his webpage that they offer “physiotherapy” in the office.  Under the description of “physiotherapy”, it lists out only modalities (ESTIM, cryotherapy, moist heat, etc).  Under the chiropractic description they state they offer a blueprint of exercises designed to help with their manipulations”   They do not have a PT on staff.  
Is this legal for them to use the term “physiotherapy” without a PT?   If not, what is the best way to address this?   I’d like to use them as a referral source as they just moved in to the building next to me, so I do not want to ruffle feathers, but I also don’t like how they are downplaying the term physiotherapy to just modalities.   (I’m in Kentucky if it makes any difference.)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely a report to the state board. 
This is a big pet peeve of mine, as they wouldn’t wait a single second to report a PT for advertising “adjustments”. 
I learned after having a similar conversation with a local chiro that they can take an elective “board exam” on “physiotherapy” which is essentially just modalities. But they’re pretty quick to change their tune once they find out they are illegally misrepresenting their business. 
Needs to stay in his lane.

> **Response 2:** They are allowed. As Chiro has a certificate in physiotherapy and rehab so they can use it. So long as they are not advertising “Physial Therapy” formally. Just word games.

I am solo PT.
 Please advise on how to respond to negative Google review.  I had discharged this patient 6 months ago and recently she texted me on my work Google voice number asking if it is possible to recover from myofascial pain syndrome. I did not reply. Now she wrote a one star Google review stating that "doesn't answer questions after session ". She also wrote name of another  PT in the area, stating  people should go to this other PT instead. How should I respond? Can I report this review to Google? Can I reply to her review and say that I had not seen her in 6 months? Will I be violating HIPPA by responding and saying I haven't seen her in 6 months?

Please advise.  Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Per chatGPT, Here are a few professional and HIPAA-compliant responses you can use to address the negative review while maintaining your integrity and reputation:

Example 1: Emphasizing Commitment to Patient Care

 “We are committed to providing the highest level of care to all our patients, and we take feedback seriously. Due to privacy regulations, we cannot discuss specific details about anyone’s care in this forum. If you’d like to discuss your concerns further, please reach out to us directly at [your contact info]. Wishing you the best on your health journey.”

Example 2: Redirecting to Professional Channels

 “Thank you for your feedback. We strive to maintain clear and timely communication with all of our patients during their treatment. However, once treatment is concluded, follow-up questions may require scheduling a consultation for a thorough response. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly at [your contact info] for assistance. Wishing you continued success in reaching your health goals.”

Example 3: Addressing the Mention of a Competitor

 “We appreciate you sharing your experience. At [Business Name], our goal is to support patients throughout their recovery journey with personalized care. For privacy reasons, we cannot discuss specifics of any case here, but we encourage you to contact us directly to address your concerns. We wish you the best in finding the care that suits your needs.”

Tips for All Responses:
 • Avoid engaging in a debate or appearing defensive.
 • Keep the tone positive and professional, focusing on resolution and respect.
 • Always provide a way for the patient to contact you offline, showing openness to resolution without breaching privacy laws.

These responses help maintain your credibility while demonstrating your dedication to patient care and professionalism.

Once he was able to contract lower abdominals painfree and do basic lumbar stabilization his lower ribs healed faster than the middle ones; we avoided rotation until it was painfree.

> **Response 2:** I would not choose to treat unless there was an X ray performed, especially if this is an initial evaluation and acute.

Deep breathing with an acute rib fracture is going to be very uncomfortable. You can teach avoiding valsalva with movements to decrease the pressure and advise on supporting his arm and avoiding overhead reaching. The advice I would give varies a little depending on which ribs you suspect involvement with.

**Community Responses:**

Also once base systems are set up, the impact on profit becomes greater with each hire.....

For PTs billing out of network how much have you seen in reimbursement for 4 units of physical therapy?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** All you have to do is submit a claim and see. Your patient won't be meeting their OON deductible anytime soon so you will have plenty of data on what the plan pays. All of them pay differently OON even within the same carrier. Some plans pay dollar for dollar and some pay a % above Medicare. If you are billing OON you need to be collecting your cash pay rate and by the time you might get reimbursed you will know what the plan pays.

> **Response 2:** Completely depends on the plan/carrier. Sometimes $80, sometimes $500 like stated above. 

We balance bill and always collect up to our cash rate if insurance low balls us. We disclose this ahead of time and it’s very legal to do so. Their EOBs even say it to the patient that the provider is OON and may charge higher than what the EOB says.

I started a small private Pilates rehab practice out of my home. Im private pay but when asked, will provide a superbill to a patient/client if they want to submit it to their insurance company. I started to see a number of older patients (over 65) for Pilates but also incorporated some balance work, falls prevention and PWRmoves (Im certified in that for Parkinson’s). Im still cash-based but after reading some of the posts online, Im wondering if I can still be a cashed-based business if they are on Medicare. As a PT, If Im providing prevention/wellness services can I bypass Medicare altogether? Im not even a Medicare provider, but thinking I ought to be (not sure of what that entails but thats a separate question ). I would appreciate some guidance on this. Im certain the topic has been covered however there are definitely gray areas so wanted to get some clarification and direction. I’ve just been charging an hourly rate or do bundled packages.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I really appreciate the insight. I feel like I can make a clearer distinction for wellness when Im seeing my healthy general geriatric pop. I feel like I run into a problem when I see patients who actually have a diagnosis, for example, my Parkinson’s clientele. Can I stilll provide PWR/dual task, therapeutic exercises (some Pilates based/some not) all out of pocket? I have a handful of people now who want to come specifically for all of these things. Can I still deem it wellness? They all understand Im private pay and are happy to see me regardless. Going forward however, like you suggested, I should be clearer on my intake form and billing. Im currently giving a bill for services the way I would a PT patient. I give them a bill on my letterhead, diagnosis code and treatment codes. I think Ive just done it that way out of habit, not realizing that my 65+ clientele really should have just a wellness bill without codes etc. because I dont want them trying to submit it to Medicare.

> **Response 2:** For anyone wondering about how to handle Medicare... I highly suggest taking Anthony Maritato Zero to Paid course. Worth the money. I have a much better idea of what is considered a Medicare covered service and can say that I have successfully incorporated Medicare into my mostly cash based practice.

I was recently browsing for courses for BFR training to incorporate into my mobile practice safely. I was considering signing up for a course with smart tools because their device seems practical for this, but then I got targeted with this ad. I’m shocked that a company who provides courses for PTs would, at the same time, refer to our service as gimmicks. 😔

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not only have I seen several of these style ads from them over the years so this is not a “new” thing for them, I made the mistake of buying $1000+ worth of their cuffs years ago. Battery died just after the warranty was up.  Didn’t even use it all that much. Their customer service was pretty cold about the whole situation and not helpful. Would not recommend them.

Sidekick scraping tools also markets like this and it made me end my brand affiliation with them

Alright all you Pilates peeps. I’ve always been a big yoga person but today I took my first Pilates class and WOW! Such important pieces of strengthening. And I was so so happy to see this class was mostly seniors which is my niche. I’m wondering if you all have ideas of where to find more info, YouTube channels, best certifications to look into for the future, etc! Central Texas if that makes a difference. This instructor told me about STOTT certification in Houston if it’s something I wanted to look into in the future, but I doubt I’ll end up wanting to be certified. Just looking to incorporate pieces into my PT sessions as I learn more.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love the principles of Pilates and often incorporate certain pieces with my patients. My friend who is a PT is Polestar certified.
I recall it being a pretty big time commitment for her and she had to go travel for a few weekends as part of her certification for the practical portion.

I don't know if this helps much but there is a PT on IG Jill Koshak Johnson who has great content.  She really speaks to the perimenopausal and menopausal female population but you can apply a lot of principles to everyone.
I did reach out to her to ask about her certification she is Power Pilates trained, said they are more old school/classical pilates. She said Stott is also pretty popular but there are many options out there.

One of the best courses I have taken is by APPI Pilates. It was geared toward Health Care practitioners and took 12 or 15 of the most basic Pilates moves and showed you how to modify them for a lower level population.  

Hope that helps a bit!

> **Response 2:** For personal preference reasons, I am not overjoyed about it, but I am in the process of becoming Polestar certified, and I have to say if you're interested in Pilates for rehab, Polestar is the way to do it. Let me know if you've got questions.

I have a former patient who wants to hire me for wellness to help him to work on overall strength. I’m driving to him and told him that my rate is $150/session.

He’s agreeable but doesn’t think he can afford to see me often. Am I pricing myself out or just setting my value? 

Considering offering him a lower rate to see him more often too.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was always taught that if you don't value your time, nobody else is going to do it for you 🙏

> **Response 2:** If they want strength- they can find a trainer for $50/hour at the local gym. If they want a doctor of PT with unlimited expertise in healthcare as well as being the top specialist in strength and conditioning, who also travels as concierge, $150 is a steal. Do not change that price. Sometimes I’ll consult with their trainer as a courtesy. So they’ll see me for PT and they can get adjunct strengthening from the trainer. I do the same for massage therapists, chiropractors, etc. If they truly want your time and your expertise, they just have to pay for it. You can give them that option and I guarantee they’ll choose you.

Ultimately I have left the field for all these reasons.

Insurance question: We are a cash based outpatient clinic. Just recently one of my clients asked me to generate a Superbill as she is going to submit a Medicare claim. I just found out that the Medicare claim can’t be submitted by the pt and has to be submitted by the healthcare professionals. I have never done this before and I am also skeptical if it’s going to affect my business in any sense? Also I don’t know if Medicare has a certain policy on how much we can charge out of network from a Medicare pt.

Please help me figure this out! Thanks in advance

Hello fellow PTs. My wife and I started our cash based mobile PT business. We consulted a law firm about working with Medicare patients. They told us that we would be able to work with patients as long as they are aware that we would not be charging their insurance. The law firm recommended we have the patient sign a Medicare Cash PT Release form. Does anyone have any experience with this? Would anyone be able to provide a template for this form?

**Community Responses:**

I needed to hear this because I have had these thoughts recently. Hope this helps some of you in the trenches with me. 

We all have bad days, weeks or months…. It is the nature of the beast of being a solopreneur and biz owner. Hell it’s the nature of life. But when is it good to give up??

I heard this from Jake Thompson today on one of his old podcasts.  “Never give up on a bad day. It’s easy to want to quit on our dreams and desires when we have a bad day, because everything in our perspective makes it seem like we should. But if you have a good day and you still want to quit, then maybe strongly consider it.”  If you can have a good day and you still don’t feel like this is for you, don’t feel bad. Realize that you have the gumption to look at yourself in the face and know that this road isn’t for you. And that’s ok. But don’t give up just because you had a rough/bad day. They are going to happen…

Uncaged clinicians, don’t give up on your dream because of a rough patch. We all have them, reach out and talk to someone: a mentor, accountability partner, a friend. They can help you through. If after a good day, you still want to quit, then realize this may not be for you, then find a new dream.  And crush that!!  Pivoting is never a bad thing!

I’m a solo practioner SLP with a very full schedule (currently at 50-55 sessions a week). I was going to hire in a PT on to my team, but have no idea how people afford to hire. I have contracts with set rates and negotiating those rates isn’t an option (peds). Her current agency offers PTO, insurance, Sick time, retirement, mileage, paid time for notes/meetings. They even offer 12 weeks paid maternity. I feel so defeated. To offer those things, you need to have a substantial amount of employees all making money for you. I don’t have that. How can I possibly grow without going bankrupt? Finding therapists in my area is nearly impossible so it seems they can name their price. I want to expand my team, offer more services, (PT, OT), but fiscally and logistically, it just seems impossible.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in somewhat of a similar dilemma, but I’m trying to think outside the box on hiring. What would drive you to work for your company? There are a good number of disgruntled PT employees out there who would probably love to be “uncaged” but for one of a number of reasons don’t take that leap. Could you offer maybe a backbone for them to grow a practice within your practice? Give them more ownership on their portion while still covering your cost to bring them in? Just thinking out loud. DM me if you want to throw ideas off each other

When you started out on your own, what did you do for personal health insurance? I’m currently in school based and hired directly so I have great insurance and my husband’s is meh 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Curious as to what y’all have found! We are currently 2 adults and 1 child in Illinois at the moment. Currently paying somewhere between $350 and $375 per pay period (2x/month) for the family.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Something to keep in mind (I did a lot of digging into this)…

If you do a plan through ACA or a private insurance company you can often pay the premiums through your business. You’ll need to check with your accountant and it’s based on the type of business structure. My understanding is you can’t do that with healthshares because they aren’t in the right tax category for the accounting forms. Also, they are not guaranteeing care. It can be a gamble for people with pre-existing conditions (protected under ACA - for now).

It’s important to look into all of it because each person will have different needs, risk profiles, risk aversions etc. If one is young with no pre-existing conditions and is cool with paying a low premium out of pocket - health shares can be great. 

It will also depend on your income. If you can get subsidies through ACA - it’s a great option. 

High earners face a lot of challenges with this.

I had an employer ask me about how someone who is an entry level employee or low wage income worker could access my expertise if I don't accept insurance. For so many reasons, I  never plan on billing insurance or participating. Just curious if any of you do sliding fee scales based on income level? Is it even legal? And how are you  providing access for all clients, not just those with disposable incomes?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have had people pay for my services with their stimulus checks. 

A woman went and got a job at a daycare after being a stay at home mom for 15+ years. Why? Because her husband refused to pay for her treatment with me. She came back after saving for a few months and paid full with her own money. (I didn’t just empower her with her health but now she has her own income and confidence to not stay dependent on another human for her well-being.) 

At times, we have to allow people to figure out how they will get what they desire. It allows them to rise above their excuses. 

That is not to say we shouldn’t discount our services at all. But it would take a lot before someone can convince me why I should earn less so that they can save on their health. 

The same people have the money for tattoos, $400 eyelashes, 100s of $$ of hair styles and highlights, money for beer on weekends, money for all the gadgets and car stuff. 

They need to figure out where they can save or earn more to pay for my expertise. 

I used to have a real difficult time not getting sucked into people’s sad stories until a coach said “would you take food out of your child’s mouth to feed someone else? That’s what you are doing when you don’t charge what you are worth. You are taking it away from your child.” That really hit home for me. 

Also, people who pay the full price are the same people who are most compliant and actually get results. In the past, everytime I discounted my services beyond my comfort level, the people didn’t even put in the work. 

People have to have their skin in the game. What they are willing to pay for soemthing is a direct reflection of how much they value it.

> **Response 2:** It is not my responsibility to be a financial advisor for my patients. It IS my responsibility to run a sustainable business model so that I am here for years to come and don’t have close my business because I’m not profitable. I can help the biggest amount of patients by running a sustainable business model that yes, includes profitability. There are rare instances where I give patients pay-what-you-can visits. ￼ Ironically, I have had some of those patients I tried to help with discounts not be grateful and no-show to those appointments. ￼

So we do our due diligence by calling and verifying benefits for every single insurance patient we have. We write everything down and keep a name a reference number as well. For every insurance patient we always ask “do you require prior authorization” and for specific CPT codes. BCBS anthem is denying payment saying we did not verify prior auth but I have all documentation that we did. They “investigated” the call and gave me 3 different stories about how we didn’t have the correct reference number, the call got disconnected, and the last story was that the call “cut out” during the time when we were apparently asking about auth. I’ve asked to hear the same recording and they won’t allow me and say that it’s not possible. I am planning to “escalate” the situation but is there anything else I can do? This is just getting out of hand and it’s sickening what insurance companies continue to get away with.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This has been a growing problem for years, and the insurance companies have no accountability. We really need to start sharing these stories with our patients. I think it would also be a great local tv story. No other industry would work the way we have to regarding insurance and reimbursement. Seriously, who do you know who worked today, not knowing when or how much money they’ll get paid. Insurance is controlling the healthcare narrative- hoping you do the “wrong thing” from “provided” information so you don’t get reimbursed. This is probably why so many of us are part of this group- to change the narrative one patient, one uncaged clinic at a time, all while giving our clients the phenomenal care they deserve. Ok, that’s it. I’m tired now

> **Response 2:** Report to state insurance commissioner.

Today I saw a patient for s/p lumbar fusion 9 days post op. I’ve seen dozens or patients with this. I did 15 min of walking with pt and doing 5 x STS with patient and her husband (retired doctor) walks in the room and SCREAMS I am not complying with precautions by doing 5 sit to stands in a row (Great form not breaking any precautions). I calmly educated him and he continued to literally scream at me. Patient was fine but didn’t say anything. I told him I understand his concern for his wife and safety but we are doing nothing outside of protocol, and I can call Doctor if wanted.  What would you do in this situation. I’m concerned it may happen again, and who knows if he blames any discomfort on my treatments and sues. Would you think it’s ok to discharge patient and recommend other OP facilities in town?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Very disrespectful. You could send her to another clinician or have family members sit out in the waiting area to provide some space to work with the client. The only time I allow family members to be in the session is if I’m doing family training.

Referral networking feedback needed:

I just stopped by a fairly large OB/GYN group in my area looking to drop my business card off and potentially talk to the referral manager. They told me they normally have people bring lunch for their physicians and basically do a presentation for them. Do y’all think that it’s worth forking out the money for the food?

Update: Looks like the general consensus is run away and put my time and money elsewhere. I agree. There were many alarm bells going off inside me, but it took hearing from ya’ll for me to listen to them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** I've owned a  practice for almost 12 years and I also started and ran POPTS (sorry, former life) clinics. I can tell you after years of doing this as a provider looking for business and sitting in on lunches for other providers, especially PT's coming in it's a complete and utter waste of time and they don't give a rats ass about you all they care about is what they're getting to eat

Hi group, long time follower, First time poster. I am contemplating starting up a mobile practice and maybe add a brick and mortar spot if the business justifies it. I currently work home heath 3 days a week and 2 Saturdays a month in acute but also have peds and outpatient experience. I am saddened on the push to DC people so soon from home health and now the census had been very low. I enjoy working with the older adult group especially those with PD and dementia as well as those who are generally weak. I'd like to keep it cash pay/private pay to avoid  insurance altogether. 

My questions are: The older adult population is heavy Medicare so can you even offer cash services for physical therapy or does it have to be marketed as wellness? 

What are good software programs to use for documenting as well as for accounting purposes? 

How do I go about marketing myself initially to the community? 

Thank you all for reading this far.😊

Picture for a chuckle 😆

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi, geriatrics are my niche and I am only cash based.  I don't find it very difficult to brand what I am doing as wellness with this population bc most of my people really want a consistent exercise program that doesn't change alot,  and they also don't progress quickly,  if at all. Medicare would never pay me for what I do with them bc we aren't working toward specific, measurable goals, and I don't modify treatment plans very often. I have a few people who are more acute and have goals but they are usually seeing another therapist under Medicare during that acute period too,  so I am the uncovered service again.  I just use Google docs for barebones documentation bc no one is ever going to ask for it 😆

> **Response 2:** Too funny, home health is my main gig too. And I cringe when they say walk right in.... always feel like a burglar 🤣

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Some cities require a business license. I would recommend checking with city hall or any city councel members to make sure there aren’t additional permits or licenses needed prior to “opening your doors” to the public. You may also need to check with the City Fire Marshall to make sure you don’t need any fire extinguishers in your space or if what the fitness center has will suffice. Good luck to you and congratulations!❤️

Question about cancelation fees -- I run a mobile practice. We charge $50 per cancelation. I've been having staff as if they get a "cut" of this fee. I've always been on the 'hard no' side of this debate because I feel like that scenario is rife for abuse. But now I don't know... Staff satisfaction is hugely important to me, and if it matters to them then I'd consider it. What do you all normally do and what's your experience? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, we always paid staff for cancellations whether % of fee or hourly rate no matter if they were contract, 1099, or reg emp. That fee is to cover their time and expected pay just as much as yours.

> **Response 2:** If I was the one who wasted my time and gas driving to the patient’s house, but you got the cancellation fee, I would not feel appreciated. If I was the one who had to rearrange my schedule at the last minute because of the cancellation, but you got the cancellation fee, I would not feel appreciated. If I had to sit around and waste my time because I couldn’t find someone to fill the opening created by the cancellation, but you got the cancellation fee, I would not feel appreciated. If you feel that you have a trustworthy and conscientious staff that you want to keep, share the fee. If anyone abuses it, deal with them. But I feel that companies that appreciate therapists are rare, so when we are lucky enough to get hired by one we take care of that company and don’t abuse their appreciation. Is it worth $25-50 to you to make your employees feel like you value their time the way you would value your own?

I’m in the process of opening a stretching and functional movement company. Ultimately I’d like to get an actual brick and mortar space, but the rent numbers are scaring me, so I’m sticking with mobile at first. I’ll be competing with a brand new StretchZone that just opened about 3 weeks ago in literally THE EXACT spot that I was eyeing to have as my space. So, my question is, are targeted Facebook ads effective? I’ve had ads for StretchZone pop up in my Facebook feed yesterday and today, so obviously they think so. But if I had to pump money somewhere, would I be better off with Facebook or doing a large direct mailing campaign?

Also, if anyone is so inclined, I’d love honest feedback on my website. Thanks! (www.stretch-ability.com)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To be honest. We have more leads in our FB than waiting for MD referrals. So go with FB ads. Good luck! Love the name!!

> **Response 2:** Good job adding this Abby Regan .As someone who has added a whole suite of wellness and recovery services to my new brick & mortar, you did the right thing if you plan to go brick & mortar soon. Do not open a regular brick & mortar with just PT. You can just rent a gym space for just PT. If you want a traditional retail space you need to pursue your stretch initiative plus more in addition to PT. Good luck!

Those of you who have worked with trauma patients, complex regional pain syndrome, severely hypersensitive to touch, etc.  What methods/modalities have been most helpful.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is my speciality. 
Trauma informed is a must. Trauma processing has 3 main stages: safety (must come first), processing, integration.  

First step is always to create some form of internal safety.   Often people with this profile have been suffering for so long their body is no longer safe.  There are many ways to help them find some area of safety internally and I’m happy to chat about them if you want more info.  
Once the person is able to identify and truly connect with an internal area that feels safe you can have them pendulate between the area of safety and the painful area or they may be able to process the emotions connected to the physical issue.

Love the idea and love you looking out for your peeps but I was under the impression that by definition you cannot provide these types of perks for 1099 otherwise they may as well be considered an employee.

Not trying to make assumptions, genuinely curious as I would love to do the same!

Enlighten me….20 sessions in 2 months … gets a second opinion from me without me KNOWING before eval he was seeing someone (I saw 20
Of 60 used checking his insurance but didn’t know what he used them for)… could someone really have missed the mark for that long 🫣😵‍💫🤯. Who keeps treating a forearm with these findings ?????
Note to MD: As part of this physical therapy evaluation, the patient presents with sudden-onset left forearm pain and grip weakness, not consistent with a localized mechanical or neurological injury. Given the patient’s history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the absence of clear orthopedic findings, I am concerned this presentation may reflect a systemic process, such as:
·Lupus-associated inflammatory myopathy
·Vasculitis affecting local perfusion
·Early signs of cardiac involvement (e.g., myocarditis or pericarditis)
The patient demonstrated disproportionate fatigue and reduced grip endurance with mild exertion during therapy, with no signs of paresthesia, cervical involvement, or peripheral nerve entrapment.
Recommendation:
I recommend medical follow-up for further evaluation, including potential lab work (CK, ESR, CRP, ANA subsets) and/or cardiac workup if clinically indicated.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I will continue to monitor the patient’s status in therapy.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is a very difficult post to understand. What are you actually asking?

> **Response 2:** Have you not ruled out peripheral nerve entrapment? I’d go there before MI. He’s a mechanic. But not enough history is provided here to determine which one based on what’s provided. What are you asking? Why not consult the other medical professional vs blasting them on an online forum?

I am currently a PTA working full time in home health but I have experience in almost every setting. I consider myself a pretty good PTA. Before I was a PTA I was a personal trainer for almost 10 years, and the top trainer at my gym for a while. I’ve been working out all my life pretty much. I’ve had multiple patients ask me to work with/train them after being dc d. 
     I want to help more people, but get paid more. I’m considering going down to PRN and starting my own thing. I would advertise as a personal trainer but also use corrective exercises, posture exercises, etc. I have a really nice home gym, I could go to there home and I have things to take to there house, or I could do online training if they needed that. 
     I feel like this could be a good small business for myself? What do you all think? Any past personal trainers turned into therapist ever thought about this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** David Bayliff who in the group is the PTA that is totally crushing it right now at his gym?

> **Response 2:** Physical therapist turned trainer. Do it as a side gig, LLC, insured, out of my house. Less paperwork and my clients WANT to work. Win win!! Do it!

Hi everyone, I’m currently about to launch online fitness programs via an app- EverFit. The programs will be specifically marketed to the mountain bikers in my community here in Denver. I’m looking for help and guidance to how to better design the programs- as clients will have varying access to equipment as well as fitness levels. If anyone has good resources on program design, please lmk!  Feel free also to check out the exercise demonstrations I’ve created and give me feedback- Rowdy Ryder Rowdy Ryder Academy on YouTube. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Would love to hear how this goes! I do running & triathlon coaching on the side and am about to start using the same app for virtual strength coaching. I’ve been putting strength programs into training peaks for my endurance athletes but have lately been getting some more requests for just strength coaching. 

I found studying for my CSCS super useful for program design. Honestly just reading through the NSCA text book was huge for me!

> **Response 2:** Check out Matt Mooney and MTB Fitness. I'd look on YouTube first. He's out of England and has workouts with minimal equipment. Good luck with your endeavors!

I was just informed by Medicare that I have to pay them back because a patient had a HH company for 2 weeks while I was treating. Patient did not let me know this and I was unaware. Is there anything I can do? Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Call the HH company and see if they were aware patient was receiving outpatient services. I’ve had to do this and had that company reimburse me because of their “late” documentation.

> **Response 2:** U can charge the pt. On our informed consent paperwork we declare that if HH comes in it is the pt's responsibility to notify, or they will be charged for services rendered.

Dear hivemind, I just read the post about a PT who’s 60 notes behind on her caseload, and I had this nagging question…

What EMR is the company using?!

More importantly, my question is, ***does anyone here as a business owner or an employed PT use Raintree EMR that they have successfully integrated with AI/Scribe/Ambient Listening?***

Asking for a friend who routinely sees two pts every hour on the hour, and has to work with Raintree, and does their notes at home. Not too much behind, but the quality of life is not great.

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Prediction AI has been life changing. After obtaining pt consent the entire eval is recorded and then summarized into subjective, objective, assessment it also formulates goals. Eval write up gone from 30 min with auto text to 10 min, daily notes from 10 min to 1-2 min. No more notes at home. For context I see between 10-14 patients in an 8 hour day. 2 evals daily.

> **Response 2:** Omg raintree is the absolute worst ! .. go with HelloNote

Edited to add i don’t do credit cards and no EMR as of yet. So it’s checks cash Zelle, Venmo, and Chase direct pay 

Advice from those who have mobile home/housecall Physical Therapy practices.   How would you eloquently respond to this ? The son is paying for his dad’s sessions  

Background:  I see 5-6 visits per day 4-5 days per week.    So , everyone before and after has confirmed for Monday.  I also often reach out over the weekend if I don’t hear back. 
I do have a 24 hour cancellation policy that I let slide for this particular client, the first two times.  So, now it’s $100 for same day cancel , if they don’t reschedule to an alternate time or day in the same week.  
Also they haven’t paid last week or this week, but often wait a week to Zelle. So I would want to mention payment upon confirming .

*help me write back please and thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Payment always at time of service. Card on file. Patients get 1 pass only.

**"I understand. Please reach out when you're ready to schedule again. In the meantime, we have two sessions overdue. Would you like to take care of the payment via Zelle or credit card?"**

> **Response 2:** Payment is required at the time of service.

Three strike rule on cancels. If they can’t work inside of that, your are happy to send them to the clinic down the road.

Had a concierge doc call me today to go do an evaluation for someone getting outpatient PT, but wants more at her home. She also wants me to do a home assessment for her. Used ChatGPT to give me an Ada compliant form so I would know what to check and make a form to fill out for fall assessment so I can give it to her. Going to find a local handyman to refer to if she needs home modifications.  This is something I have been thinking about doing, but no promoting it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jeremy Sutton let me know if you need our Home Modifications/Environmental Assessment form. I will email it to you.

> **Response 2:** That's fantastic that you're looking to support your patient with a home assessment! Ensuring safety at home is so important for promoting independence and reducing fall risks.

As an OT who specializes in conducting comprehensive home evaluations and recommending personalized modifications. Our training focuses on how individuals interact with their environment during daily activities, considering both physical and cognitive aspects.

There's substantial evidence supporting OT-led home modifications in improving patient outcomes. Collaborating with an OT could enhance the support you're providing and ensure your patient receives the most effective care.

Hi, I am not currently working as a PT (focusing on growing my mountain bike coaching business with a side of strength and conditioning.) I'm worried about CON ED and maintaining my PT license- what do y'all suggest I do to make sure I am keeping up with the requirements? I do have a Medbridge subscription and was going to try to find some courses related to athletes. Any other ideas?  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** HIGHLY RECOMMEND Joe's course!!!! It won't be a waste of time for you like other CEUs would be

> **Response 2:** How many hours do I need and in which categories? Having a hard time finding this on the APTA CO website- I need 20 hours from educational coursework- so this can be 20 CEUs from something like Medbridge or Summit?  Then what about the other 10 hours? If I remember correctly, we also need an ethics course? CPR counts for a certain number of CEUs?  Thanks, never had to worry about this before when I worked in corporate clinics and was working towards a certification as well as mentoring students.

First take of my social media intro video and photos of my new location:

Please if you are willing to watch the video give me some feedback. Also if you have anything positive or helpful criticism to say about the photos that’s great too.

Update: Thanks for all the feedback everyone. I’m going to get some branded shirts made and make a series of videos instead like some people have suggested. My goal will be to limit the main intro video to 5 min or less and each follow-up side video to 2.5 min or less.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would be a little more upbeat during the video, especially at the very beginning—you want to exude excitement right off the bat and get people interested. Nice place! Looks great. A few other suggestions: make the video more concise/short 11 mins is long for a potential patient to watch all the way through, wear something branded to showcase your business. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** Thank you for your service! 🇺🇸I love your mindset on exercise, inclusivity🏳️‍🌈, reaching goals of your clients! The clinic looks great! Shorter video, have a couple 1 min videos to highlight treatment areas and large gym. Hire a professional to film. Need a mic for better audio and filming needs editing. Fill the gym up with clients, friends working out, need music too. Will you have other staff? Add special effects/text in video to drive home key points, visual impact. You want to invoke emotion for action, I think most people only have attention of 1 min to get your message then they swipe. You are very brave to put yourself out there for feedback. Good luck!! 👊🏾👊🏼👊🏿

Best free or low cost video on demand platform to create a library of exercise class videos? Bonus if there is also the ability to purchase a reoccurring monthly subscription through the platform. I’ve been considering youtube, Vimeo, arketa. Interested to hear peoples’ thoughts and experiences.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t know about the subscription part but YouTube is super easy to use, and you can adjust how your videos are accessed. I have mine private where patients can access with a link but they’re not searchable.

> **Response 2:** Has anyone tried Arketa? I am currently trying to launch with them and the customer service has been terrible. Just wondering if I need to pivot or if it gets better?

For those who are doing mobile PT and/or pelvic health PT and have hired other PTs, how/what do you pay your therapists? Hourly/salary/rate? 
(In Texas)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I hired a pelvic floor PT (in my brick and mortar clinic) and she has a commission rate - so base pay is one rate and that’s for any non-patient / non-revenue time like consults, documentation, marketing etc and then she gets a commission rate per service for times when she’s bringing in revenue (evals, treatment sessions). 

I consulted with an employment attorney to make sure that was legal and allowed, and my employee and I agreed on a base rate. 

So for instance, if she works an 8 hour day I pay her 8 hours at the base rate and if she sees 6 patients that day she gets $xx per patient x 6 extra for that day. She earns more when she does patient care, which is what I hired her for. I own a 100% cash based practice, for reference. This gives her more incentive and accountability for converting patients to evals and full POCs - which helps me avoid burn out from having so much pressure to fill her schedule - we both benefit when she’s fully booked 🌟🌟

*also want to note that I’m hiring again so if anyone in Colorado Springs is interested (or knows of anyone looking for an amazingly supportive place to work…message me )

> **Response 1:** I use profit first and it seems to take a lot of confusion out of the process of paying myself

> **Response 2:** Gusto for payroll, integrated with Xero for books/accounting. Started off with quickbooks, but hated it and switched to Xero which is so much more user friendly.

Pt referred to PT with order 2-3x/wk x 12 wks…..

Pt discharged less than 4 wks ago after couple months tx with max potential reached……

PT eval concludes no skilled tx needed as no functional decline noted . (obviously pt is upset about it as they think PT is personal trainer from insurance) 

Now,
Question 1: does this make physician upset as well? 
Question 2: did PT do anything wrong? 
Question 3: how would you explain this to the pt as physician order specified the frequency and duration already?

All input appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** PT determines frequency and duration, not the physician based on medical necessity. If the PT decides 1x/wk for 4 wks before DC or 3x/wk on 1st follower by 2x/wk on 2nd wk. It is up to the evaluating therapist. The physician will not protect you if insurance or Medicare determines that you are over utilizing or abuse of the services.

> **Response 2:** PT determines the frequency. It's their professional judgement and treatment plan. Writing frequency on a referral is old school. If the patient's goals are met, they are done. Good opportunity to educate the physician if they are upset about it. I would guess it's just built into their EMR and they don't even care how many visit happen as long as the patient is better.

Any tips/tricks on convincing someone to hire you as an independent contractor (through your own LLC)?

Wanting to call around to several Home Health agencies asking if they’d hire a PRN DPT and would love to use my LLC so I can start using the tax benefits. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I told them they don't have to pay my liability insurance nor the other half of employment taxes and they were good with those ideas. Then I get to reap the tax benefits with deductions.

> **Response 2:** I did this! I did a Google job search for HH agencies near me who were hiring. Then I created an email and attachment to explain my business and that it's available to contract. It worked and I contract with a HH agency. They already had contracts in place, so I didn't have to worry about creating one.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Watch the massage therapists turn out to be your best asset and see your value most.... least that's my experience

> **Response 2:** When we moved to WA state, we didn’t have a job or much of a plan. I made a list of every PT clinic in the city and walked into them with my resume in hand. (I was a therapy aide at the time.) 

It was SO hard and awkward, but it paid off with interviews and eventually a job! 

When you go beyond what most people are willing to do, you reap the rewards!! 

(One job I didn’t get had a jersey hanging on the wall with my last name on it and 3 very excited-looking sports PT guys at the table.  I had no idea who the player was and at that moment I knew I’d blown it. 😆)

Hi everybody!  I am a cash-based practice and I provide superbills and help people with the insurance process to try to help them get reimbursed.  I am getting super overwhelmed though and don't have time to spend hours on the phone doing this and am looking to hire somebody who can help me with it.  What type of professional/position is it that I need to hire?  I don't know where to start!  Thanks all!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Didn’t you start a cash practice so you didn’t have to do this?

> **Response 2:** Your clients should be figuring out how to submit them! You just provide the superbill and the client takes it from there. I chose that model for my practice so I never have to talk to another insurance company again.

For everyone who's an Amazon associate!! This updated Mar 1, 24 and I just verified with Amazon. You are now officially able to text, email, and msg associate links! This is a huge game changer and makes it soooo much easier to get your patients the products they need without having to add it to your sight, LTK, of post it on social. I've been with them 13 years and it's about time they changed this 🙄
Just be careful with text still, I'm seeing some say especially for new accts, they'll still shut you down (just open a new one if it happens). Social msging is best msging option so they can still track it. 
Here's the new tos from Amazon:

***I received consent to post. R ant delt atrophy compared to L 

Hello uncaged clinicians! I’m treating an elite powerlifter. Has anyone ever seen something like this?  He was told by his doctor that his ant delt n (axillary n?) would never work the same again s/p RTC repair (yrs ago).. He trains bodybuilders so I know he has tried training his delt in all shapes and forms, but this atrophy impacts his barbell chest press numbers. Any insights? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have, could be multifactorial.

Is the nerve issue due to the MOI or is it iatrogenic from surgery?

agree EMG/NCV would be beneficial 

Regardless need to assess the radial nerve mobility and clean up any impaired issues.  

Capsular mobility?

Also, what’s his pectoral mobility like?  Needs to have close to 65degrees of horizontal abduction at 90 degrees abducted otherwise may contribute  to continues reciprocal inhibition patterns. 

If interested I’d be happy to FaceTime or zoom to talk further and even reassess so I can see his clinical presentation.

> **Response 2:** Bill Johnson, I feel like you just treated someone with nearly the same condition with massive success

**Community Responses:**

If it is the Amazon Influencer Program it is that you don’t have enough subscribers/followers and not enough engagement.

Help needed:

I have a cash based business where I specialize working with runners and triathletes. I do a lot of wellness visits /running evaluations. I had someone reach out to me who lives over an hour away and asked if I have a surcharge fee for going that far and I wanted to get everybody’s opinion on how much you’d recommend charging. With gas being so expensive and extra time driving that far wanted to be fair. I charge $130 for a basic evaluation and typically $150 for a separate running evaluation with fully analysis. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** $130-150/hr normal rate 

Driving to/from will be two hours of your time not including business expense of mileage on vehicle and gas. 

Definitely charge for time and expenses. 

Something like 20% of normal service charge for out of radius visits plus $.05/mile?

Or just a flat rate that changes with the market if you want simplicity

> **Response 2:** I wouldn't charge extra. Think of it as an extra marketing and extra word of mouth. Another person changed. Good luck my friend!

**Community Responses:**

Hard pass. Narcissists will always turn your boundaries into their victimhood.

Non-compete question! 

I’m looking at working PRN at a home health company while I work toward becoming independent with my mobile services - the non compete they want me to sign is making me question doing this! Both of our services are in the home and I was hoping to have clients from HH transition to my cash services when HH services were completed if able, but it states I can’t see past, current, or future clients from 9 months from my termination…help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So let me make a distinction. There is a difference between opening your own practice (non compete), and taking their company’s resources (non solicitation). They can absolutely come after you for solicitation of their clients while an employee of their company. Clients are the $$ of a company. Each valued at approximately $150 per referral in marketing costs. Taking clients would be considered stealing proprietary information and they could win a monetary amount for whatever their ROI is for that client.

> **Response 2:** I would double check with them on this. Because it could be a win-win. You could refer patients to your company after Home health once they have been discharged. And it's two separate services home health and outpatient, which don't necessarily compete with each other.

I own a mobile hybrid med B practice ( Healthy Aging Physical Therapy) - 16 providers (PT and OT) seeing around 900 visits/month for size and scale - and managing the new patient and eval process (between intakes, scheduling around estimated DC timelines, adjusting for changes in DC timelines, completing the VOBs and any addressing prior auth needs) is an absolute BEAR of a job. Ive built a pretty sophisticated spreadsheet system to manage it all, we’re on HENO for EMR, and use a Google form for our new patient registration to reduce the phone time required during the intakes.  I have an amazing 30 hour per week office manager who does the vast majority of it, but it is still overwhelming. I covered for her during her vacation this week and processed and booked 23 new evals🤮 booked between next week and into mid September. Everyone is at 100% capacity all of the time (knock on wood, I know these are good problems to have) - I Would love to hear any feedback from other similar sized practices how you manage it - any secrets to doing this more efficiently? How many admin staff / hours are typically needed to manage this much volume? We’re about to add two more FTE’s and im worried about our capacity to manage the additonal volume increase ..

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First off. Amazing👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

You need to integrate go high level. It will help immensely. 

At those numbers are or now or considering a brick and mortar?  

We use Jane but our intake process rarely less than 4% of the time required anyone to be called or answer a phone.  New patients create a patient profile when they try to book  an appointment. It allows them to see the schedule. Choose the provider. Time. Services requested etc.  they upload their insurance. We require a credit card. It automatically send them the forms they need based on the visit type they choose etc.  

Then after the evaluation the therapist delivers the plan of care and schedules the full plan right then and there. It adds to commitment to the plan.    

If patients need to reschedule or change because of life. They can call in or go on their portal and change the visit on their own.  I promise you less and less people are going to call in each year.  2 years ago we had a 300% increase in online bookings. Having never spoke to anyone. This year we are at 437%.    Returning patients almost always use it unless they are 85+ and we are down to less than 6% of new to the practice patients that call in. Everyone else does it themselves. 

And you know what. 

Patients tell us how happy they are, how easy our system is and that they specifically chose is the first time because the other place the phone just rang and rang.

> **Response 2:** Hi Katie Wadland - we are similar.. started mobile and still have a team that does that next to a growing clinic base. 

We do roughly 800-900 visits a month.

I'm also on HENO and have a google spreadsheet empire - in particular for our onboarding process management 

We have partnered with rehab CEOs for years and out that have a nice flow in go high level CRM and also the guidance there across many clinics is generally 1 front office fte for every 110 visits or so.. so you're definitely pushing into 2nd front office hire territory. 

We also partnered with VA Rockstars - a PT specific virtual assistant staffing company.. because you're mostly mobile it sounds like and a lot of this being a discrete repeatable task - a VA could be a great way to get that hire done 

Lastly - I'm in a similar scenario as we grow and I'm looking at onboarding in and of itself as a discrete phase or 'project' - with that I'm looking at project management software solutions ... Things like Asana, motion, Trello or Monday - I'm still sorting out if this is the move myself

You have to have people like that. People who will plant seed of greatness. People who will encourage you. People who wants you to win. People who will bring out the best in you. Not the worst in you. 

Captain D thanks for all the encouragement and mentoring you provide. Not just for me. But as well as the rest of the UNCAGED CLINICIAN !!!

Happy PT month from GeriHab Physical Therapy and Wellness !!!

I am currently a solo mobile OT, I take Medicare and OON with everyone else. I am looking for advice. I’m currently full with a 2-3 person waitlist.
I’m in Florida so it’s very seasonal. During season I was slammed. Treating like 10-12 hours a day.
I said I’m not doing that again next season. Well season is over, and it really has not slowed down. I know it’s a good problem to have.
However, I need to have time to do the business and marketing. I have a girl who helps me with front desk tasks and a billing team for submissions. So that takes some load off.
I enjoy going to marketing events and building relationships but I’m really burning myself out.
I’ve went the hiring route and that has been really hard. 
I’m willing to scale because I just feel like I’m burning out and hitting a ceiling.
My front desk girl is helping to market which is great but also there is limited space.
There’s more I can talk about but that’s the general gist.
I’m thinking either I go cash based, or create a concierge package they must buy in to…
Any other tips would be great thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You didn’t ask a direct question other than tips. And really this is personal. I say this because my wife and I both PTs do mobile as well. I want to see more to make more and can deal with it. She needs more of a break and a healthier balance. 

I say that because you should take a minute or a weekend and write out what you want your life to look like. Your biz and practice should serve as an extension of you to provide you with that life, not take it over. 

From there, a lot of what you’re saying will work itself out. I’m not saying it will be easy but you should have a closer idea of where you are taking your practice. 

For example, we don’t see ourselves getting a space. We like the flexibility. As much as I’d love one, it doesn’t serve our life and goals. So we won’t. And every time I get the desire to get one, we always reference our goals. 

Have your goal, then work backwards. There’s lots of options to stay mobile though. You can hire, you can raise prices, set limits on number of Medicare clients, etc.

> **Response 2:** So, my opinion is that the point of being mobile and working for yourself is that you get to control your time. If you feel you’re burning out, cut back. There are a couple ways to do that: hire, stop accepting patients, discharge people, change the type of patients you accept, or raise your prices. You can do any combo of this, but my opinion is that your most lucrative option while also cutting back on hours would be accepting only cash (so commercial insurance based) clients. You can provide superbill a on request, but you have complete control over what you bill, and therefore will be able to see fewer people and still probably get close to what you were making. And most importantly, you’ll burn out less.

Does anyone here have PTAs working for them? How do you talk to your clients so that they don’t think they are getting lesser quality care from a PTA vs. a DPT?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you think that?  I employ PTAs and OTAs and have never thought that.  So I would first ask yourself, how do you see them? What makes it lesser quality care?  To be honest, most PTs are so caught up in evals and paperwork, they have little time for treatment.  On the other hand,, assistants only treat, all day long.  They are experts.  But it doesn't matter what anyone here thinks, it's what you think.  If you have any biases, then you won't be able to convince anyone otherwise.

> **Response 2:** I used to manage several PTAs before opening my practice and if you spend the time to teach and train them they can be very good and provide super high quality care. If you can pair that with a good personality the patients may even request them over you. Just like we were taught, they can be taught too.

Has anyone gone from cash-based to in-network? I love my clinic and what we do… but since I hired another therapist I can’t get enough clientele to make overhead. But then if I switch I feel like I’m going to end  up like every other mill in my town and I refuse to do that.  But I know others in here do insurance…. I saw my bosses in my old jobs rolling in dough while I was barely make ends meet…. How does insurance reimburse these days?  I have someone trying to convince me to be a multi-specialty clinic because it reimburses more… is that true? Has anyone done this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I see this a lot, so I’ll be direct but hopefully helpful.

Most of the time the issue isn’t cash vs insurance. It’s that cash practices expect being cash + good clinical care to magically solve hiring and filling schedules. That works when you’re solo. It breaks the second you hire.

When you were alone, you had low overhead and lots of time. You could network, run workshops, meet people, hustle. Your hire is not going to do that at the same level, and they shouldn’t be expected to. At that point, you need real systems.

Cash pay clinics that scale well all have a few things in place:
• Strong sales skills from the first phone call through the eval
• Clear package presentation (you have to sell packages)
• Continuity options so people don’t disappear once pain improves
• An intentional marketing channel that doesn’t rely on the owner’s time

On the insurance side, one thing I saw in the comments stood out. If BCBS reimburses better than your cash rates, that’s a pricing issue. Your cash rates are too low.

I totally get wanting to help more people, but once you charge anything above $0, you’re already excluding someone. So you might as well price in a way that lets you run a sustainable business, pay staff well, and not burn out. Don’t pick prices everyone can afford. Pick prices that support the business and the life you want.

Multi-specialty can reimburse more, but it also adds complexity and doesn’t fix weak sales or marketing. Plenty of multi-specialty clinics still struggle for the same reasons.

Before jumping in-network, I’d fix sales, marketing, packaging, and pricing first. Cash pay can work very well, but only when it’s run intentionally.

> **Response 2:** in what part of the country are you located?
In network benefits (BCBS) vary a lot depending on location.

I know PTs can’t order X-rays and have them reimbursed for insurance, but is there anything that says we can’t own X-ray machines and charge cash?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think the bigger question you should be asking is, someone gets injured and maybe breaks a bone, are they gonna call their PT or go to an emergency department? I've told people to go to urgent care over fractured collar bones (which are 99%+ non-op) and everyone still insists on going to the ED even though collar bone fractures are not life threatening. So imagin is a moot point. PTs no matter what will always be one of the last places people to go for a radiograph. While we can manage a lot of injuries, splinting and casting is not in this tool kit and the patient still needs to be referred out. (knowing what you don't know and when to refer in itself is a sign of expertise). If you're looking to push for added income, there are better places to look. The cost of a machine vs return on investment seems like we'd have to do multiple unnecessary images to even break even. Not to mention the unnecessary radiation this exposes patients and staff to. Also, our profession needs to focus on the issues that already exist like fighting third parties who steal our income, dealing with prior authorization processes that are impossible, making referral for profit illegal, etc......so many better things to focus on.

> **Response 2:** That’s a tough one, check your state laws. I’m betting to say no. Diagnostics equipment has been getting more cost effective. I think this should be an agenda for the APTA , they should get on the ball for certification classes to allow competent PTs to read X-ray ( think rural health). Ultrasound for imaging services as well. Good question though. And can’t compare with chiro , they have extensive knowledge on imaging compared to a DPT . Gotta give credit where credit is due.

Does anyone use Jane as their EMR system?

I am starting the process of looking at EMR systems to use. My patient population is mostly Medicare age clients. Currently will be out of network with all other providers, but may start credentialing with insurance companies if it will be worth it. I am ￼also hoping to have cash based PT, private wellness, group fitness classes, and maybe virtual sessions in the future. 

Right now it’s only me, but I’d love to expand to add other therapists (PT, OT, SLP) in the future.

It seems like Jane will fit all of my boxes for now and future growth, but I am wondering if there are any other systems out there that might also fit my practice. ￼￼￼￼

*Side note: Looked at hellonote, but not sure if it would fit for my group fitness needs in the future.￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree it works well for private pay but there is absolutely no automatic way to track compliance for Medicare like when a PN is due or UPOC. I can manage being solo but I can't imagine having to track it if I had staff. There'd be no way to run a report to see what's due. The billing side seems ok to me but I just started using it with Offic Ally and a biller.

> **Response 2:** I use it cash and superbill route and cannot imagine navigating it through Medicare. They’re working on adding form tracking for things like LEFS outcomes but it’s not there. It’s beautiful for how it use it sans insurance

**Original Post:**
Where does medicare draw the line of 'medically necessary' (I know I'm not the first one to ask this....just frustrated again)?  Say we have someone who can perform their daily functions with no restrictions (but maybe some mild discomfort/pain), however their main complaint is that  they are limited & painful in their ability to go hiking and play pickleball.  Would a wellness plan, with a treatment focus around making hiking & pickleball easier for them to participate in,  even if it entailed some manual therapy skills, be allowed under a cash-pay arrangement?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t confuse services covered under the Medicare benefit with medical necessity. 

Medical necessity is just one part of the requirements for covered services. 

Reasonable is another part. 

Standard of care is another part. 

This is a balancing act for sure. As Nancy mentioned, you are the therapist and make your determination based on the initial evaluation and findings. 

After that you develop your treatment plan and based on published guidelines you make a determination of what YOU believe falls within the coverage guidelines. 

You may charge cash for non-covered services and seek reimbursement for covered services. 

But reimbursement is always conditional. 

Ultimately you are not the one paying the bill nor is your patient. So Medicare would make the final determination if it ever came to that under review. 

And when Medicare makes that determination the Medicare rep will look at published guidelines and your documentation. 

I would say by far most of what I see in small, private practice outpatient therapy is largely non-covered services. But therapists are so desperate to help their patients they are willing to assume the financial liability associated with over utilization of services. Or they just don’t understand the intent of Medicare coverage.

> **Response 2:** Sounds a lot more like a cash pay service. Unfortunately Medicare isn’t concerned about someone’s ability to play pickle ball… regardless of how important it is to the client

I find the majority of my referrals come from word of mouth and other small business owners, not large hospital-owned physician practices.

How are we dealing with people complaining about having to have a CC on file?
We’ve been recently having patients sign a credit card authorization form to keep on file for late cancellation fees and remaining balances (hybrid clinic here). We’ve been burned too many times of patients having late cancels and not paying or arguing about it (despite having a cancellation policy they sign with their intake forms) or patients with large insurance balances going towards deductible that they’re not paying. 

We’re getting some push back from patients about keeping a card on file and charging a late cancellation fee. Our late cancellation fee is pretty nominal, $20. Any advice on how to approach these conversations besides being polite but firm?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are the kind of patient who complains about having a card on file, then they are the patient who is going to late cancel or no show. It just shows that they’re not who you want to be working with anyway. If they complain about it, just respectfully say that you may not be the best fit for them and move on.

> **Response 2:** If they have a large deductibles, charge them by the visit. If they’re in network insurance, a good role of thumb is it at least $100 a visit. They’re not willing to pay that then they don’t value what you do and they’re not a good fit for you. Likewise, if they’re not willing to put a credit card on file, they’re not valuing what you do.  They don’t see the value on you so they don’t think that they should have to pay you.  Do you think that they complain when they have to pay a bill at a restaurant or a credit card on file at the gym?  This is a sign of a process problem and/or people that don’t value your business coming into your system.

Hi everyone, I could really use some advice and perspective from this amazing group.

I’ve been feeling a bit stuck lately—my schedule recently went from fully booked to a little quiet, and it’s starting to impact my mindset. Some of the change is positive—several patients progressed faster than expected and were discharged early (which is great!), but I also think summer schedules and vacations are playing a role.

New patients are trickling in, but many are opting for visits spaced a week or more apart due to financial reasons. While I completely understand and respect that, it’s been tough from a business standpoint. I find myself spending even more time outside of sessions—checking in, following up, and prepping between visits—and it’s starting to feel draining (not burnout, but close).

I’m slowly getting into social media, but it’s very time-consuming and I’m not sure I’ve found my rhythm yet. My niche is pelvic health and chronic pain across the lifespan, mostly serving women, and while my patients are committed, their own full plates with work, family, and other medical appointments make scheduling consistent care tricky. We’ve started offering some telehealth sessions, which helps, but overall, the dip is weighing on me.

This is the first real slump I’ve experienced since opening. Friends and colleagues keep suggesting I contract with insurance for the short-term, then phase it out after growing my client base—but that route feels overwhelming and not aligned with how I want to work.

Has anyone else navigated a slow season like this in a cash-based or hybrid pelvic health practice? What helped you stay afloat and continue growing while staying true to your values and energy? I truly love the work I do, and my patients are getting great results—it’s just the business side that feels heavy right now.

Appreciate any ideas, support, or even just solidarity 💛

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Been uncaged 20 years.  Spring of 24' my scheduled dried up for a month or so.  Ebbs and flows of a new post covid environment.  Since u r uncaged, taking insurance will not change how u practice, but will change your reimbursement rate.  We took most when we opened, only take 2 now.

> **Response 2:** I have a similar practice. I’m a pelvic therapist and I do Dry Needling. I don’t take any insurance except for Medicare. I’m in Florida so summer definitely slows down seasonally. But I take advantage of it and take Fridays off in the summer. But if you have a cash based element to practice, you definitely have got to be engaged in social media on the regular. You have to have a foundation set up and then get yourself established in organic conversations through different Facebook groups that focus on your population. I have found this to be Very very helpful. I would strongly suggest against going with insurance. If you really feel like you need something temporary contract with a home health agency and do a little home health on the side. Also consider connecting with a home health agency and offering to do a Pelvic Floor program for them. Just a basic bladder training program nothing crazy because I don’t do internals in the home with the elderly. But teaching basic bladder health and having a program focused on incontinence in the elderly is fairly simple and straightforward, and it can be a good way to diverse by your practice and show up your schedule in times like this.   ￼ also also connect with local outpatient physical therapist helped them identify your patient population to refer to you. I get a lot of referrals from massage therapist Chiropracter‘s other physical therapist. They’re a great source of referrals. Also look for a business women’s networking group local. The one I belong to is very supportive about referring patients and it’s also been a great resource of patience ￼￼

**Original Post:**
I want to feel out the Uncaged community on a business idea I have. I am a physical therapist and have 16 years experience, with the last 11.5 years being in home health with a mostly geriatric population. In my work with senior patients, I find that most of them won’t keep up with their exercise routine after I discharge. I get it. It’s really hard to start and stick with an exercise routine when no one is holding you accountable. But when they don’t keep up their exercises, they usually lose the progress they made with me and end up weaker, often falling and breaking something, at which point they’re referred back for therapy again and we start back at square one (or even further back). I wish insurance companies would pay for regular, ongoing therapy visits to prevent this kind of decline, but the reality is that they just don’t. The patients I treat are homebound, so going to an outpatient clinic usually isn’t an option. Mobile therapy options that bill as outpatient are also limited (my sister actually had her own practice doing this but recently moved out of state, and I have no desire to deal with the insurance headache that she had to, all for minimal reimbursement).

So here is my idea. To have a business that offers only wellness visits to seniors. No skilled physical therapy service, which means it is not billed to insurance and does not require a plan of care. It would be private pay only with visits as often as the client wants. Almost like having a personal trainer come to the home but with the knowledge and training of a physical therapist. The goal would be to assist clients in performing their home exercises and establishing an overall wellness routine, while also being able to monitor patients for red flags that their doctor may need to know about (like signs of infection, high blood pressure, low oxygen, etc) in order to prevent avoidable hospitalizations. Does anyone here have a practice like this? Is this a service you think you, your parents, or your grandparents would use? I have such a passion for helping the senior community to improve their health and prevent (or at least slow down) any avoidable decline, so I’m brainstorming ways I can make that happen. ☺️ (I know this was long…thanks for reading!)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am doing this now.  I’m a certified personal trainer as well as a physical therapist. There is a huge need when I discharge people from Home Health physical therapy to continue with the wellness program. This works great.  I do carry malpractice insurance on my business. I also make them sign a consent form stating that they are receiving Personal Training and not Physical THERAPY in order to cover myself.  Another thing I do is work with Luna, which is a company owned by a physical therapist who does all the backend billing. Once the patient is discharged from Home Health I picked them up as an outpatient physical therapy. The company does all the insurance billing authorization and calling the doctors. Once that’s completed I offer wellness packages.  ￼

> **Response 2:** One thought I had about marketing would be to take this to the local ALF’s/ILF’s. There are several in my area. Yeah those places may have daily exercise classes, but in my experience, not many residents take advantage of those classes. Partly due to laziness (don’t want to leave their room) or partly due to not wanting others to see them doing exercises in case they can’t keep up. Others just aren’t motivated at all, which would likely translate to not being motivated to take what I can offer either, in which case they’re not my target client.

Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for the interest and DM's
I will answer each inquiry as soon as I can but I'm taking a weekend seminar so please be patient with me.
Thank you again !!!!

Please delete if not allowed.
I'm closing my pelvic and lymphedema clinic in firt pierce Florida because we are moving to another state.. I'm selling all my equipment 
Prometheus semg biofeedback with sidtware
Real time ultrasound imaging with software
Prometheus Mr 10 stim unit 
High low table
Emsella kegel chair
Pilates Cadillac table abd springs
Call me if you have questions 772 3427559

PS I still don't know where I'm moving too. My husband just retired from the fire department and wants to move to a cooler state. I want to move somewhere that's nice for raising a 10 yr old, and work at a happy pelvic clinic and not a corporate PT mill. Anybody want to hire me?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I always got emotional when i saw bad comments on the chair online but i use it everyday and it works.  Before i got the chair my patients were getting better. But i wanted faster results so patients get better in half the time wuth the chair. I still do everything biofeddback, manual therapy, pilates etc,  but i honestly love my emsella chair.
It has the standard protocols on it but I put a new one that I made and it works like a charm . I can teach you. Pelvic PTs hate the chair but when used properly it's a game changer. Medi spas just put the patient on the chair they don't look for episiotomy scars, hypertonic muscles, constipation, pelvic pain  spasm like we do. I always balance hip and pelvic floor muscles strength, coordination and flexibility. If you do that the emsella is wonderful.

> **Response 2:** Since you are from Florida like me, you’re used to not paying a state income tax. It’s a big shock when you move to a state that does have it. Look at Tennessee, it’s beautiful, mountains and no income tax. ￼

**Original Post:**
I have a question I hope someone can answer for me. My parents recently moved to Florida from North Carolina. My mom was in the hospital & was discharged home. She will be getting home health PT & skilled nursing (Med A). She needs therapy badly. They will then be traveling back to NC in 2 weeks for 10 days. I don’t want her to go 10 days without PT-she can’t afford to lose any more function. I’d like her to get PT through my Med B mobile business. Can her MD in Florida write her a script for PT & I would be able to provide her with therapy while she was here?  I live in NC & am licensed here as well as the other therapists that work for me. I realize the home health company in Florida would have to discharge her from her home health episode of care before she would be eligible to receive PT through Med B. But is a script from her Florida doctor sufficient? Or does it have to come from a NC doctor?  Thank you for any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Out of state referrals are fine but you or your company cannot treat your parents and bill Medicare.

> **Response 2:** You can treat your mom for free and not bill any insurance. Why go through all that?

Mobile PTs- what do you do to keep your equipment organized and not run in/out of your car a million times every session? 

I’ve got adjustable dumbbells, physioball, therabands, TRX, massage table.

Just scheduled my first cash-only mobile client this week!!! Any advice on flow, organization, documentation, etc is welcome!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use two car organizers and bags...I just place what I need for that patient in a bag. If I really need something mod session I will run to go get it. Also, I try to ask patients what they already have in their home and use what they have more than anything. This also helps with HEP carryover when they know exactly how to do it with their stuff.

Hi there! I currently have a cash based mobile PT practice seeing orthopedic patients. I’m also TPI (titleist performance institute) certified but do not see a lot of golfers yet. I have an opportunity to have space at a local
up and coming high end golf club. They want to be able to offer PT/TPI screens to their members. I would be an independent contractor and could bring in my own private clients to treat and use the space as well. No rent but will take a % of each visit. 

In my area, no other golf clubs offer anything like this so I have no reference. Does anyone work in a similar set up? Any words of advice, questions I should ask, or things I should look out for? I’m meeting them next week to discuss details. 

Thanks in advance for your input! This group has been amazing and helped me tremendously along this journey!

Mobile PTs: what have you found to be the best ROI for marketing? In terms of effort, time, and money.

Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BNI has a pretty good return for cash pay. Find a bigger group if you can. OON providers rely on that org to get started pretty heavily in my area because other members are incentivized to send to you

For real though. Ask your clients (who are doing well and love you) if they know anyone else who could benefit from your help the same way they have.

Hey everyone. So I’m looking at a space to rent in a chiropractor’s office. It’s a massage room and I do like the area. I’m just starting out and he suggested $65/ hr or $250/day would be the going rate. He said those numbers are from someone he rented the space to a while back but they were from a bigger company. 
I told him I’m just starting out and that it may just be once a week as I build up clients. He said that the rates aren’t firm and would be up for more discussion. 
For those who have been in this position; do you guys think this rental rate is typically fair? Or too high? 
Just wanted to get thoughts; I think it a bit high.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I pay 400 for a room for a month;)

> **Response 2:** $65/ hr?! That’s a lot of money! My first room I rented was $25/ hr and that was in Los Angeles! I now have a suite that I pay $875/ month now so the $250 a day is a rip off too!!! Look else where!

Anyone? In over two years I have not received anything like this. I didn’t request this. And I am 99. 99% sure I am not interested as the person who saw me was happy to pay me the money because I actually solved their problem in one visit. Yes, I am out of network. ￼￼￼

**Community Responses:**

They are probably trying to negotiate a massively discounted rate.

**Original Post:**
Hi everyone! I have started my mobile practice – cash pay and Medicare- but I am absolutely hating dealing with Medicare. Reimbursements are all over the place and I’m tired of being stressed trying to figure out why and getting signatures for POC’s has been a nightmare. Has anyone ever gone in with Medicare and then opted out in less than a year? This is a side hustle for me and with two other traditional positions right now I would rather just focus on the cash based side. Thanks for your help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are a PT, you cannot opt of Medicare. You can choose not to take it, but that means you cannot charge cash for skilled therapy services (that Medicare would cover) to Medicare beneficiaries. Reimbursement is not great across the board with any insurance, including Medicare. The rates are dropping again in January. I honestly find Medicare probably the easiest insurance to deal with compared to other insurance headaches I deal with.

> **Response 2:** ￼ It might not be Medicare that’s the issue. It could be the combination of the EMR and billing company. What state are you located? What billing company are you using? How many clients are you seeing?

How would you proceed to discharge a patient who is causing havock, is pushy/aggressive and keeps pushing your boundaries, BUT is also a health care provider (though other discipline) and not only you share a few patients with but has sent you patients in the past (so kind of a referral source, which is why I’ve been very diplomatic). Plus this guy is super charming and his patients love him. So I am nervous about him bad mouthing me. Ugh
I have 7 additional sessions authorized per his insurance. It pains me the idea to see this person 7 additional times. And the chance he will want to complete more afterwards and get approved for it. For what is worth it he is improving. And he is happy with me as his therapist. It is just that the emotional havock he causes is not worth the discounted rate his insurance pays me. 

Please advise!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Generally if he is like this with you he is like this with everyone. 

Of course he likes working with you because you are willing to let him be this way and it feels good to him. 

If it ends badly it will likely happen in the way you expect. He will through a tantrum and make you feel guilty but it doesn’t matter. You can only be a punching bag for so long. 

His influence on others also doesn’t matter. They likely know how he is and won’t put much importance on his opinion. 

Personally, I would finish the approved visits. Increase the intensity of the workouts to a level high enough that it is uncomfortable for him to continue. Celebrate his success and if he choose for more just find a “better” therapist who can take him to the next level of success. 😂

> **Response 2:** I know this personality all too well. You absolutely cannot give in to his demands. It’s like adding fuel to a fire. He knows he can take advantage of your demeanor. Once you cut off his supply of validation/winning, he will find a new target. It doesn’t mean you have to discharge him immediately. Do the 7 visits and have a firm end date. He will likely periodically bother you in the future but don’t give in! Also if he bad mouths you, ignore it. These types of people are smear campaign experts. He will flip flop between badmouthing and praising you.

For those who are solo practicioners do you find it’s worth it financially to work on your own from a tax standpoint? I’ve heard the amount of tax you pay is significantly higher than if you’re an employee.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You pay a self employment tax that covers Medicare (2.9%) and SS (12.4%).

Yes, owning my time is worth much more to me. We homeschool, I have a mobile PT practice, I participate in pro bono events, I run a mentoring/coaching service, and I'm able to run my business ebdeavors the way I desire. All-around win for me and it hasn't been a financial hit tax wise either.

> **Response 2:** Being taxed as an Scorp helps significantly! Make sure you work with an accountant that is an Enrolled Agent (EA)— they are experts in the tax department for small businesses. My accountant has saved me tons of money by knowing the ins and outs of all the nuisances of being self employed

I’m working with the mother of a friend a friend (cash-based). She is on hospice for end stage pancreatic cancer, but the hospice nurse comes once a week. They were very disappointed to hear that a PT was working with her and they said that Physical Therapy should not be done at this stage. I am working on comfortable sleeping positions, gait training to the bathroom, which has a step up, suggestion of grab bars, AROM to tolerance, teaching the home attendants and the 24 hour people (that are not nurses ) how to transfer safely. Why is this considered a poor choice as per hospice care? ￼￼ the woman is walking and talking, able to carry on a full conversation, consents to exercise, feels much better when we are finished and sleeps more soundly Post RX.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You are doing a wonderful job supporting your client at a most meaningful time in their life. You are adding safety and quality of life.  Do not doubt your service to them in any way.  I work in oncology rehab and have worked with many clients to very near the end of their days. Whatever is most important to your client is what matters most.  Your hospice provider in this case is misinformed.  Many hospices would totally support the work you are doing. Thank you for your work in supporting this person in their most challenging days. Not many are able to do that.

> **Response 2:** Because if it's "medically necessary" then they have to pay for it. 😀

I just had somebody apply for a position and stated that she eventually wants to pursue her own practice that she previously started but isn’t in a position to grow it right now. She’s great, interested and aligns with my company’s mission but my worry is that she would build a caseload under my company and then take them to her own practice eventually. We are a fast growing multidisciplinary practice and she would be the first of her specialty 
Is there anything to do? Should I pursue or avoid?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Slightly different opinion because I've been in business in a small town now for almost 15 years in two different clinics that I've owned.
The old me would operate in fear and say not to hire her because she might hurt your business later... However, the new me who's been through this before both positively and negatively would advise this: 
IF she truly fits your mission, your culture, and can help you grow your business now, hire her. Mentor her as an entrepreneur. Teach her business on purpose. If she offers a specialty that you don't have currently, let her bring it to your clinic and build rapport with the community. 
If or when she leaves eventually, help her be successful and she'll do the same for you in return. Think of this as a partnership opportunity instead of a competition. Maintain her respect for you and when she leaves, that respect will remain and she may refer to you for people who don't fit her mold. Anyone who leaves with her is not your ideal client anyway. 

I actually developed a Direct Pay Mentorship Program with the intention of bringing in staff to build my practice, mentoring/training them to run their own practice, and then I offer an opportunity to stay or to leave to start their own. They may stay after seeing what running a business actually "costs" in time, money, and sacrifice.
I live in rural Appalachia... We don't have a high population or a great socioeconomic status, but there are still plenty of clients to go around. When you are mentoring someone who is driven, it helps BOTH of you. They will generate referrals for you while they are with you because they desire to be successful. They will push your business forward and make you better if they are the right fit... And you have ensured that the community has options for great care, whether it's you or not. 
At the end of the day, she may stay or she may go, but you can make it a positive experience for both of you if you approach it from a different perspective... 
I hope this helps!

> **Response 2:** They told you up front.Good sign of integrity. A shady person looking to snatch business likely would not have.

I would hire and maintain good communication along the way. When/if she wants to break away from you and do her own thing make sure there is a mutual understanding of expectations.

The reality is some people will follow her even without her solicitation. That’s showbiz.

We’re in the people business, you build relationships, provide care for people, and people build bonds with providers/patients they spend time with. These bonds will cross company lines, and that’s ok.

Plenty of business to be had.

The program will be for people with joint/muscle pain. 4 week guided elimination diet, 4 week reintroduction phase, 4 week maintenance phase. 2 in person PT sessions / month with app basic exercise and mobility program on trainerize. I also have a bachelors in nutrition so incorporating nutrition and PT made sense to me. I’m networking with a functional medicine NP to refer if blood work seems necessary

I’ve moved over to a more cumbersome system charging 2.4%. It’s a pain compared to square but the savings are $10k plus per year for us.

> **Response 1:** I get 55-65 for my PRN. Work mostly for the 65 one.  I negotiated Bec they offered me low and I have 20 years of experience and they were desperate a year ago!!  So I have been PRN for years in many states. Haven’t done FT since 2017

> **Response 2:** The fee-for-service rate was also the “OT” rate when I was full time.

Planning on cash and word of mouth but feel insurance is inevitable to take getting started.  In our are BCBS seems to be the dominant insurance.  How do you determine what insurances to become a provider for?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Insurance is not inevitable in getting started. Plenty of people do it without. Do what you want but don't believe the lie that you NEED insurance or that it is INEVITABLE.

> **Response 2:** Demographics. My clinic is in a hood w lots or cops and city employees. They all have BCBS. I’ve been burned w Cigna and Uhc so I don’t go there anymore.

I have a patient with Medicare (I'm a participating provider) and UHC AARP supplemental plan, I called to verify benefits... Medicare deductible not met and AARP doesn't cover the deductible, they pay 20% once deductible is met. What do I charge the patient until the deductible is met... The full allowed amount of the visit? 20% of the allowed amount?
When submitting claims, do I then put on the CMS1500 form how much the patient paid? When will Medicare know when the deductible is met?

Thanks for any input, this is my first time seeing a patient where the deductible isn't met!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Colleen Tickner Crawford did you figure out what to do? I’m in the same boat right now? If you were collecting the payment up front, what did you do to show that you did that so that can apply towards their deductible? You still bill Medicare?

> **Response 2:** Option 1: treat but know that what you Re supposed to be reimbursed will go towards the deductible and not you. That is about 2 visits. 

Option 2: have the patient pay the $226 to you and then treat.

Option 3: if they are not willing to pay deductible let them know that therapy services will begin once deductible is met.

I cannot find it now but one of the FB PT message boards (I really thought it was this one), someone asked about a client with poor balance and an arm issue not being able to flush the commode. 

And I just saw this on instagram. I hope they find this… and I hope this doesn’t mess up everyone’s Instagram algorithm.

**Original Post:**
If my currently employer is willing to hire me through my LLC (so I’ll stay but also still be able to get all the tax benefits) - that’s a slam dunk yes, right? *In Tennessee by the way*

I make ~125k/year as a salary employer and would be giving up PTO and a 3% max match simple IRA plan BUT I’m sure you all know the benefits of being a business owner. 

I created my LLC last year but after having a kid 4 months ago, haven’t been able to do any “side work” after my 9-5, so I haven’t even tried using any tax benefits since it’s not drawing in income. 

I see this as a way to continue having a simple 9-5 job, get the tax benefits, and not have to stress about TRULY being a business owner…. Also I really need a new truck 🤣

*I do know that they save money with not having to pay benefits, but they made it sound minuscule. I had planned on asking for $5/hr more, should I aim higher? My benefits cost me $50 per pay period at the moment.

**I am the DOR and run 9 clinics - hours would never be a concern.

Last edit: I got this idea after a PT told me that he had a HH company hire him through his LLC and he writes off vehicles, utilities, dinners, an “office” space in his home, etc. But based off this thread, idk if that’s legal.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Getting patients isn’t the hard part of business owning. You’d have to be just as compliant as a 1099 contract. Especially to actually classify as a true 1099. Contractors do not get benefits. Also, questionable if you can have decision making power in your role inside the company and constitute as a 1099. 

You would be responsible for your own WC insurance, malpractice, and other insurances. You would still have to file business paperwork annually. You’d still have to have accounting software. I’m honestly not seeing the benefit of maintaining your LLC.

> **Response 2:** Having you as an independent contractor with a 1099 is a huge tax benefit for your employer, but it can screw you at tax season because you end up having to pay half the taxes that they would pay 100% of if you were a W2 employee.

Has anyone thought about a brick and mortar then decided they don’t want to manage others and deal with that headache and went the route of scaling on their own. Online classes, programs, YouTube videos, but also seeing people mobile in person as well? I’m at a crossroads and leaning toward the latter due to hiring issues I’m having! I’m barely in and already stressed with the hiring ordeal! Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started online with the intention of going brick and mortar. So glad I started this way, to avoid the headaches of overhead and being physically restricted to a space. Message me if you have questions, I'd be happy to help!

> **Response 2:** I started online, selling courses and still selling some. Then I did mobile and now have several brick and mortar and ALFs and a total of 30 employees/staff/contractors. Just really depends on what you really want to do. You want to be a therapist? Employee? Employer? Influencer? YouTuber? What is it really that you want and then go from there. Good luck and keep serving my friend.

**Original Post:**
Have you ever been worried you'll hire and train someone only for them to leave, take your clients, and leave your business hurting? 

This is a fear I hear from our clients all the time and one I've felt before. 

The reality? 

VERY few people actually WANT to be business owners. This is a hard for me to say as a coach who helps people start businesses but the reality is that most people don't want that life. They don't want the risk they just want to be able to achieve something through their career and they feel that the only way to accomplish that is by being the business owner. 

What does this mean? 

If you can find and hire someone and give them what they're actually looking for (respect, autonomy, flexibility, financial upside, etc) and they see that they can do that WHILE working for someone I can almost guarantee they won't leave. 

People don't leave to start businesses because they want to be business owners, they leave because they feel like that's their only hope to achieve  what they're looking for. Don't give them another experience to solidify that belief and they'll reward you by sticking around.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you hire an exceptional PT, (the ones whose schedules are in high demamd) and you really want them to stick around, offer a path to part ownership of the practice.  At some point, they themselves will want to become uncaged.  This is how a lot of Attorney and Medical practices operate.

> **Response 2:** No. I don’t hire anyone that crazy.

My dad threw his back out. He's in Colorado springs. Looking for a good Ortho PT recommendation who does dry needling, and maybe traction and takes Tricare (select I think). 

Also looking for a rec for an orthopod that will actually take the time to look at him, be willing to order an MRI, and isn't surgery crazy

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dr. Hammers is a neurosurgeon in the springs. Very good and not eager to operate.

> **Response 2:** If you want a good ortho PT Phil Plante at Action Potential is the best. They take Tricare and he is really good with the spine

For those that do dry needling for cash pay, what is your cost for a dry needling session if that is the only treatment provided and how long are those sessions typically?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 250 whether it’s DN or not, 30 min or 60 min. Lot of the visit is rapport, assessment, treatment, and follow up education.

> **Response 2:** 80 but they need to be an established client and do an eval.

I launched my cash-practice 11 weeks ago!!

I am practicing out of a sports performance gym and treating athletes/active individuals. I am working the kinks out and optimizing systems… the joys of business ownership lol. 

My question is, in relation to direct access/legalities/ethics what am I missing when it comes to true “PT POC” vs wellness programming and treatments? Practicing in Louisiana (for reference) Direct Access laws are very open and direct. 

I’m in an environment where clients have issues but not really injuries. So, trying to figure out the optimal way to create a treatment plan/program to meet their needs and my bottom line. ANY thoughts would be more than helpful. Love this group of people, thank you in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m five years into my cash based practice in TN, and despite my best efforts, I cannot find a clear answer to this question. There’s so much gray. Clearly, a post-op pt is a PT client. But, someone who’s having shld/back/knee stiffness, etc could fall into both the PT category and the wellness category. One thing I was well advised about is pricing. I suggest charging the same rate for PT as for Wellness…BECAUSE your long term wellness clients will likely need PT at some point and it’s too confusing (for both the patients and the business) to charge different rates for the same patient. I’m interested to see other comments here.

> **Response 2:** Cash based OT with mostly manual therapy skills/ortho/sports etc. 

How I approach wellness: 
Anything that needs more than AROM, MMT or orthopedic assessments for the evaluation I would consider skilled, for me. 
If I can do a rapid assessments and determine the cause of the problem through the three things mentioned above then I don’t consider it skilled, as a LMT could also do those things. 

How I approach skilled: 
usually this is a lot easier. People will come directly from the Dr or surgeon with a plan already in place. A diagnosis, recommendations, etc. Typically the more in depth standardized evals that will take an extended amount of time to perform and interpret are my signs that it is surely skilled. 

How I avoid the grey:
I just have everyone get a Drs referral. This helps the grey area and they can also deduct from their taxes as a business expense. So it’s a win win.

Okay all you mountain rehab/snow niche peeps. Texan here who went skiing for the first time. I’m looking for targeted exercises to help me next year LOL!! My hips and glutes were just screaming after the first full day. Plyometrics, hill work, core, standard resistance training for BLEs? Anything else? Would love to hurt less next year, and to help out my poor family members who needed more than my yoga and flexibility skill set 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Love training for skiing !!!

> **Response 2:** In addition to the above, I love doing wall seats timed for a very long time, since you're working on a lot of muscular endurance as well and holding that contraction just like when you are skiing down the mountain.

Skaters are awesome also for more explosive mvmt

Hello guys! How do you respond to a “clingy” patient? Clingy (not suree if this is correct word) in a sense that she expects me to remember her birthday (she was already discharged when she celebrated her birthday) and expects to give her flowers or gifts for Mother’s Day. She is currently in my case load. She commented that her housekeeper gave her a beautiful bouquet of flowers for Mother’s Day. I just said, that’s so thoughtful of her! 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Clearly there was a lack of boundaries or this person has unrealistic expectations of a professional relationship.

> **Response 2:** Yeah boundary issue on her part. It happens. Just don’t feed into any of those totally inappropriate expectations If that’s an issue for her, she will deselect. Sounds like you responded correctly.

Looking for recommendations of companies that do dry needling training. 
Bonus for a company that will allow us to host and signficantly reduce the price of our employees taking the class in exchange for us hosting and helping to fill the class to make it worth the trainers time! 
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Check out AAMT. They are amazing! I recommend them to anyone who wants high quality evidence based training and yes they will work with you to host at your facility! James Escaloni can you help facilitate this conversation?

AW RITE! AW RITE! AW RITE!

It's FRIDAY!! 

You know what that means, people. 

Time to **KICK IT UP A NOTCH!**

Excited for my dude, Steven Baptiste.  His clinic, *Elev8 Movement LLC*, was nominated for *Best of Gwinnett County* (Atlanta, GA)! LET'S GOOOOO!! 

Kicking It Up BIG TIME tomorrow will be Ashley Will.  She is getting married in beautiful Sedona, AZ! CONGRATS!! 

Crystal Abitz dropped some big news this week.  She announced that the family will be growing to a party of 5 in the Spring! WOO! HOO! 

Jeremy Sutton is making strides in his practice, Healthy SBC  (Shreveport - Bossier City, LA)  He has announced that he soon will be adding a location to compliment the mobile aspect! GROWING, BROTHER!!! 

One way to grow Famousity is to appear in the local magazine.  That's exactly what Josh Lopez did this week. His spread (and mug shot) on *Should Getting Stiffer As We Age Really Be Considered Normal?* appeared in the *Active Senior Living of Mohave County* (AZ)!! 

Bill Johnson has grown his practice to 2 therapists now after only 13 months in business! But he's not done.  A third will be starting soon! UNCAGED!!!! 

Perhaps the grandest way to KICK IT UP is to bring life into the world. BIG CONGRATS to Meagan Duncan and hubby Jason who welcomed their newest bundle of joy, little Cael Phillip! 

Wedding Bliss abounds! CONGRATS to April Manint Egan who got married!!!

Shout Out to Kevin Hamidi who spoke at the 6th IFCA Legacy retreat! SOLID, bro!!

Tricia Smith said "ADIOS" today to the job in WI.  She is headed back home to Ohio!! CHEERS!! 

Jordan Floyd had the Grand Opening for his newest location of *Limitless Therapy and Wellness*. This one in Spartanburg, SC! LOVE THE GROWTH, my friend!! 

I am beyond stoked for Kelly Shannon, the personal physical therapist for women's professional tennis player, Emma Navarro, currently ranked #10 in the world.  Navarro made it to the semi-finals of the women's US OPEN - her first major semi-final! Although she lost, it was an incredible leap in her journey. WAY TO HAVE HER IN TIP TOP SHAPE, KELLY!! 

We ain't done with the US Open! Wolfgang Oswald, personal PT for men's #12 player, Taylor Fritz, has his player playing in his first Major semi-final as well!  LET'S GOOO! 

Selfishly, I gotta give a shout out to my "Black Sheep" classmates from Shenandoah Univ Class of '94 who are gathered for our 30th Reunion!  I wish I was there with you all!! Kelly Crispell, Eric Schneider, Steve Patane, Bill Johnson, Karen R. Jones, and many others!! MISS YOU GUYS!!  I wanna hear you belt it out to *FRIENDS IN LOW PLACES *!!

Looking for advice and suggestions. 
I own a small cash based OT practice in FL. 
With my practice I do private sessions in homes and group based sessions in the community. From adult to older adult. I recently stopped all of my PRN work to dive full time in my practice. Life has hit a little harder than expected, I am in a place where I need to find a side position to make additional income. Any ideas of what side hustles to do? I am torn between doing another OT position or just something completely different on the side to give my brain an OT break due to the stress of starting an OT company. I am feeling extremely defeated. Also, for those that have a cash based practice how long did it take to really get going?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Taking Medicare would definitely open a larger client population for you. People often don't realize the time required to build community connections and establish a reputation. OT is harder than PT for sure. I am happy to chat with you about options to build your practice.

> **Response 2:** I manage my husband’s mobile PT practice and enrolling with Medicare made a huge difference (only traditional Medicare and OON with advantage plans), he still has cash patients and charges his rate and quite often Medicare patients become his private pay patients after discharge from Medicare services if they want to continue wellness. I myself  trade futures in the market. I feel it’s the best skill in the world but the hardest one to learn but if you master it you are golden. I only trade 1-3 hours in the evening, last night was great, I made more than double on 2 trades than working 10 hour shift as charge nurse with weekend differential lol. But it’s a skill like any other that you need to learn. Affiliate marketing, selling life insurance on the side, digital products are some other side hustles that our healthcare friends do for extra income. Feel free to DM me.

Hello! I am a PT in the Michigan area looking into starting my own practice. For those that used LegalZoom to register their LLC, did anyone pay for the highest cost package? I am tempted, only because it says it offers the formation of documents. I was wondering if they would help write consent forms, HIPAA agreements, consent for photos, etc. Is this what they would help with? Is it worth the cost, or should I just register on the michigan website and figure the rest out on my own?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No need to pay LegalZoom to register your LLC/PLLC in MI.  It's very easy to do on the state website.  I'm in MI as well

> **Response 2:** Michigan here. I can barely do this stuff and thr LLC was so easy! Don't pay for it!

Hello fellow clinicians. Can you guys give me a ball park of what you're charging cash based clients for evaluations and treatments. A ball park because I know there's different circumstances. 
Thanks in advance

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am mobile I charge 150 for an eval 125 a visit. I typically stay in a small area.  I know two other therapists in my area who do clinic based cash PT, one charges 160 an  hour, with an intro price on the eval of 87 to get people in the door,  the other one 225   for an eval or visit. She has a very specific niche… runners.  Both own their own clinic with a second or third PT working with them.  

  I realize my prices are lower and I am mobile,  but some of my patients actually see me more than 1 times a week whereas with their business model they often will see someone and then have them come back maybe once a week, every 10 days,  or every other week, etc.

> **Response 2:** Thank you all so much. I live in FL. I wanted to make sure I'm fair across the board but also making a realistic business decision.

I’m from chicago. I’m in Fort Lauderdale right now. Met w a mobile MD group. I have been informed when they add POS  12 their rate is tripled. #letsfightforthis #3X

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not sure what Cuba Gooding has to do with us. But my question is point of service 12 is that considered “the patient’s home”? My rates are the same for reimbursement

> **Response 2:** Do they also have to confirm homebound status? The mobile MD notes that I see have statements for why the patient needs to be seen in the home. I would guess, on average, HH PT visits under Medicare A are around double per visit than a part B visit

**Original Post:**
I need help! I was seeing a patient with Luna (outpatient at home) and patient was in the process of having Luna become an official provider with her Mass Mutual long term care insurance. She was not using Medicare whatsoever. She was self pay with Luna and Mass Mutual after 90 days would begin to reimburse her. Long story short, the patient and her husband became so irritated with the process (Luna and MM) that they have decided to hire me (cash based) to see her. 

If they do clear me as a provider, I am wanting to make sure 1. Mass Mutual understands that I am mobile outpatient and not home health. 2. If she was paying Luna self pay at $125, is it totally off to pay me cash?

After 90 days of care (she started with home health then moved on to outpatient) they will reimburse her services once they get the invoice. I left the clinic to not have to deal with insurance. I’m venting and asking for opinions on this, whether I should take her or not. She would pay me and I would provide an invoice just like Luna would have done for her. 

Hope this makes sense! Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Besides the Medicare issue, I had a similar patient who wanted me to work with her when I wasn’t established. I gave her receipts. But then she wanted to submit all the receipts to her long-term care and get reimbursed. The long-term care insurance wanted full codes, and Proof of billing that Medicare rejected it before paying for it. I would just make sure that she’s not using your bills to get paid back because then it opens up a can of worms. ￼

> **Response 2:** Tricky situation. Typically the purpose of a LTC plan is to cover costs for the insured if they lose the ability or need significant help with at least 2 of 6 functional tasks: bathing, eating, dressing, toileting, bed transfers, and chair transfers. If her home health discharge OASIS paperwork showed that she was independent with these, Mass Mutual may have a case not to pay them. You would essentially have to show that she is restricted with at least 2 of these.

Since she still has Medicare, there still may be a case from a CMS federal level that she can’t pay you cash if you/the patient are trying to  make a case that her treatment is medically necessary (because she has functional limitations that need treatment) 

I personally wouldn’t take them as cash pay and would have them continue to go through Luna and/or use Medicare part B insurance. If she needs services like dry needling or other skills that are helpful and not covered by Medicare, I would invoice them for that and they can submit those services to Mass Mutual. They may still be eligible for some reimbursement and you wouldn’t be caught in a battle between CMS and their private LTC policy

What are some strategies to deal with an employee with poor time management?
Also same employee makes careless documentation errors and they have over 5hrs of paid documentation time a week.

We've uses deadlines, lists, planner and Google calendar. 

Whenever they miss a deadline and ask why, they just simply state it was an oversight on their end. So I appreciate the accountability, we need action to accompany it.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Some people need to take responsibility for their own issues.  I NEVER got paid for documentation.   Sounds like they need to grow up , become accountable.  And not get paid until their notes are done properly.

> **Response 2:** the safe approach is to handle performance issues in writing and follow a consistent process so it doesn’t look retaliatory or arbitrary. Here’s what that normally looks like:
 1. Document clearly – each time something happens, note the date, what occurred, and what policy or expectation wasn’t met. Stick to facts: actions, deadlines missed, or behaviors observed.
 2. Meet and warn – after one or two incidents, have a conversation and summarize it in writing (“verbal warning issued on X date”).
 3. Written warning – if it happens again, issue a formal notice describing the problem, the expected correction, and the possible consequences of continued issues. Have the employee sign acknowledgment (not agreement).
 4. Final warning / performance plan – outline a short period to improve (usually 30 days) with measurable goals.
 5. Termination – if there’s no improvement after documented warnings, you can end employment. Keep all documentation and communicate the decision succinctly and respectfully.

Be sure you’re following:
 • State and federal labor laws (e.g., anti-discrimination and retaliation protections).
 • Your own written policies—consistency is key to legal defensibility.
 • HR or legal counsel advice if you have it, especially before final termination.

🐴🐴Anyone work with horseback riders? 

I’m doing a presentation tomorrow at a riding arena for a group of riders talking about overall strengthening, mobility, stretching programs to make them better riders. 

I have a couple of riders I work with and have some ideas but if anyone has any go to resources or really cool mobility/stretching/strengthening exercises they use let me know. 

Thanks and have a great day. !!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been riding in the hunter and jumpers for 40 years. Hip mobility and muscle imbalance is a common problem especially right worse than left since most riders mount from the left side. 
Concussions are also a common problem

> **Response 2:** Check out Shea Competitive Edge on Instagram. He’s not in this group but his exercise ideas and reels are awesome!

Hello! I am at the point where I need to get a business phone number. I have reviewed posts and am just wanting some real life reviews on the different phone systems. I’d like it to be an app on my cell phone with a local number. HIPPA compliance is a plus if necessary. I will be opening a cash based practice here soon! 

Spruce: $24/month. Seems to have a decent amount of stuff. (Is this an app on your phone?) 

Lead connector through GHL- I saw this posted but am not sure what it is! 

Iplum: $8.99/month. With HIPPA compliance $5.99 if paid annually. Includes: Unlimited calling, texting + Security & backup for HIPAA compliance + Unlimited Secure Texting + Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
‍
Ring central: $20/month. Doesn’t seem to have as many functions. 

Grasshopper: cheapest plan $14/month. $19 one-time +$1.50/month for local number. 

Ring Rx: starts at $15/month -no texting or voicemail transcription on cheapest plan. $19/month includes these two. (Is RingRx an app through my personal phone with a second number?) 

Google voice- I see pricing at $10/20/30 through Google workspace. Looks like it is also free for *personal* use. 

Vonage: can’t find much. Looks like the lowest is $13.99/month 

Thoughts? Any others I should look at? 

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Lad connector with GHL

> **Response 2:** I’m on Google Voice right now and while I’ve been happy with it, I switched my domain and now cannot for the life of me figure out how to port it out (I know there’s articles saying how to do that but they’re all not working for me 😩) so I can associate with my new domain. So I might need to switch numbers which is a pain in the ass. So if I had to go back in time, I’d tell myself to make sure whatever I signed up for can be ported to another service if needed!

When you own your own business as an Occupational Therapist you get to treat at the top of your license-no pressure from a big corporation pressuring me to see more patients - you get to take your time and actually see that patient and write goals like this: 

Patient will collaborate with the OT to create a personalized vision board that identifies meaningful short- and long-term life goals, routines, and sources of motivation to support ongoing recovery.

Rationale: Vision board development facilitates self-reflection, motivation, and executive functioning, activating cognitive and emotional processes related to goal setting, habit formation, and occupational engagement. It supports intrinsic motivation for health behavior change and aligns rehabilitation goals with personal values.

There are two different angles to consider…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** After almost 2.5 years I realize for those not doing it or not making it “happen” either don’t want it enough or have someone else enabling them … has to be. I pruned out the people who didn’t support me or didn’t raise me up. It works

> **Response 2:** I have one bag with all my stuff (including first aid kit and BP cuff).

Sometimes I bring along heavier stuff, like you said.

Sometimes I consolidate and put the bare necessities in the carry case for my treatment table.

Super doable!

I’m growing impatient. I’m a mobile massage therapist for now, doing fine. I have much more to offer, and I feel I would grow faster if I have a physical space. 

PhD in Human and Sports Performance
MA in Sport Psychology
LMT
CSCS

What are some resources that could help me break the mental blocks and go for that physical space? Right now I feel like I’m in a catch-22 situation where I need more clients and revenue to justify the rental space, but if I had a rental space I could have greater biz growth and potential. How can I get from where I am to where I want to be? Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You already said it. You will grow faster with a physical space. I say go for it! That's what I did. 😁😁😁

Just took the leap of faith and the rest is history. 😁😁😁

> **Response 2:** Look all the time for rental spaces. You need to find the happy medium between great location and affordable. When I signed my lease in Jan this year I had literally 2 clients and neither of them were people who could come in to my studio. I was taking a huge risk, but the space I found was never going to come back again. So I took the leap, and now a slow week for me is 18 visits working 8:30-2:30, including seeing those 2 clients at their homes still. All this is to say: the number are scary. Risk is scary. But we have to do scary things to accomplish stuff… so take the leap! You can do it!

**Original Post:**
In the last 2 months we’ve had 4 doctors specifically ask us to start working with Medicare as they want to send their patients to us. At the moment we don’t take any insurances. Any advice for or against taking Medicare?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Of course I’m very biased because we’ve had a Mobile hybrid practice since 2018. Re-recommend taking Medicare and doing cash for everything else. Except of course if you have an insurance that pays extremely well. We have a couple of those. ￼

> **Response 2:** Take medicare if u bill 1 ta 1 te 1 nr and 1 mt its 108 dollars per visit where i live in florida outpatient and if u live in nyc boston la etc major cities it pays more.  Eval with 2 tx codes is 140 dollars and most people have medicare with a secondary which means they pay 0 dollars and you get over a hundred.  All u need to do is get their doctor to sign ur plan of care which is easy theres no authorizations etc its easy

FYI. Zoom in. This is RTM …. Immediate feedback on HEP. I messaged her right away to hold 3.  She is young. I’m not getting RTM reimbursement but it’s my HEP program too. And yes there are pictures to the left (cut off) and there are videos for the patient to play.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have you actually submitted to Medicare and gotten reimbursed? From what I have heard from other providers using MedBridge, the cost of trying to get clients to answer the needed questions after each session, to correctly login each time, to set up and the cost (at least on MedBridge) was not worth it. Larger places have a PTA contacting them and basically urging them to keep logging so they can bill out. Also, at least in MedBridge, it doesn’t even track the time spent for you, so you still have to do that. Some sort of timer when you’re in X client’s chart seems helpful for this thing. It feels like one more way to track stuff that isn’t actually helping. (We have a EHR with great messaging so we hear when we need to about HEP and if it’s an issue. We can also track it in MedBridge but I prefer to have all I can in our EHR.)

> **Response 2:** Very cool! Yeh, please come back and let us know the cost. Thanks for sharing

I’m having a bit of a lull in gaining new clients, and I’m okay with it. I’m here to remind you that there is always a blessing in the slow times. 

I made the most of my time this week: caught up all electronic records, wrote a blog article for my website, submitted 2 manuscripts to International Sports Coaching Journal, and published my first podcast episode!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm slow too. And although it's come at a good time in my life physically,  it is stressing me out financially. I can't survive like this for long and it's been over a month without new clients. 😪

> **Response 2:** Wow! You are planting seeds for success!  Hope it comes this week!

Big question for ones who are practice with a gym and is hybrid:

A new gym opened, offering a PT room to solely just one PT.  They’re charging a rate of $2,000/mo and do not take any percentages and have only on PT on site for the gym.

Still being a new practice and currently mobile, the gym itself is an ideal set-up, but I’m still trying to build clientele. I believe the gym is 18,000sq ft and trainers would refer their clients to me. 

I’m just anxious of having that big of a monthly payment with low clientele. Wanting to build it up first. 

Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have this exact set up. But in my opinion $2000 is way too high. I would try to negotiate a lesser amount. $1200 max. Or try to negotiate a cost per visit so the gym is incentivized to send you clients.

> **Response 2:** Maybe explain your concerns and negotiate an “on ramp” period where you might pay like $1000 the 1st month, then $1500 the 2nd month, then the full amount to give your time to build up your clientele and income?

Yet another example how this company is not selling "therapy" and is probably doing really well. I have no idea of these concepts are research based because I'm not a PT or one who specializes in runners, but they sound fancy and impressive which I'm sure helps their marketing even more. I even went a step further to figure out what the heck s "Functional Practitioner" is and still don't know.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Devil’s advocate here. Am I the only one who wants to throat punch people wielding the “evidence based” cudgel? Same for the posture and mechanics don’t matter crowd. At the end of the day people don’t give 💩💩and a flying f… about your degree, certifications, etc. They want results. I work virtually with sporty kids all over the place with various issues, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms that mechanics matter very much. Many have been to multiple different medical and non medical folks before reaching out.  PRRT is one of the techniques I use with these folks and many boards push back on certification of the CEUs because of insufficient “evidence”. Tell me it doesn’t work when I can drop jaws from 11,000 miles away, or when a woman’s back pain for 5 years after a hip replacement is gone in about 30 seconds from several hundred miles away? If they’re helping people, then good for them. That being said I’ve seen some of their ads, but haven’t looked all that deep into their stuff.

Thinking about a mobile PT niche to provide more flexibility for my family. Anyone out there a mobile PT? If so, what are advantages and disadvantages? Private pay ? Thanks for any info.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been doing it for about 6 months and love it! I treat a lot of pregnancy and postpartum folks so it’s super convenient for them. I also love having the break of drive time in between patients, especially as an introvert, to recharge. I treat out of my home for some folks too and that has worked out really well! 

Cons: like others said, drive time, but I limit my driving to 20 min radius. Also limited in how much equipment you can use

> **Response 2:** Possibly dumb question but do you accept pts in only certain areas? Thinking of safety nowadays 🥹

**Original Post:**
I have a patient with orders to start outpatient services S/P Reverse TSA. He is already seeing a nurse from Home Health for the same. Home Heath PT evaluated and DC’d after saying he needs Outpatient. Can I see him for O/P PT when he is already receiving services from Home Health?As per my understanding one can not seek outpatient services when receiving Home Health, due to billing concerns. Is that true or false as he is not receiving PT from Home Health? 

Please advise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Always ask about home health on your discovery call before setting up the appointments. Patients think since it’s different disciplines they don’t understand 2 different payment models can’t be covered simultaneously

> **Response 2:** Has to be an AGENCY discharge from home health to bill part B services, not just PT discharge. Home health part A services is paying the agency to provide all nursing and therapy needs. Whether or not they’re actually providing the therapy services or just nursing, a part B therapy claim will still get rejected - or paid now and you’ll get a recoupment letter later.

Hello!

Curious as to everyone who is NOT uncaged (still working as a staff PT), what is your comfort level with taking patients who your clinic has discharged (totally done with them) and offering them wellness services/coaching/performance services, privately (not associated with your clinic)?

If not comfortable, why?

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in home health, even if we dc our patients I would not feel ok taking them on as part b or wellness because as a home care patient they still have the option to private pay if their insurance does not cover continued services. It’s tricky, I would love to be able to follow my joint replacement patients with outpatient rehab, but even then I’d be self referring with PHI from the company’s EMR.

> **Response 2:** I think it depends, does your clinic offer these services? I’m in home health so they don’t offer any type of wellness, so I’m 100% comfortable offering it to people, and I have let all my agencies know I do part B PT and wellness.

Ownership/employee (wear all the hats) : Overwhelm this morning! It’s a beast. Always reaching a new level and new level of fatigue. Any advice? 😅 Will it get any easier with hiring? Does the minimum time available after work for “living” expand at some point?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m going to go LIVE shortly on this. I’ll tag you, Alyssa Nichole Bryant!

> **Response 2:** It does get easier with hiring and once you’re “doing” more and “learning” less! It takes a lot of time to learn everything and put it into practice. My advice is to take all the admin time you need. Take classes if that will help you (it did for me). 

I have also found the balance is what you have to strive to create. Dedicate the # of patient care hours you are comfortable with, same for admin time, and same for family time. 

Calculate your hourly break even point and how many patient visits you need to meet your goals. 

You’ve got this! The best part is you are in control! Do what you need to to find and create a good work life balance!

I got a beautiful gift from my mom for Christmas. She doesn't listen to the Uncaged Clinician podcast, so she had no idea HOW significant this was to me.

One of my absolute favorite episodes is called Anchoring to Your Purpose. Around the 7:40 mark, Kevin DeGroot shares an analogy of the uphill climb on a bicycle, comparing that feeling to business ownership and pointing out why it's not the same at all.

There is no coasting downhill for us. Leaders are *always* climbing.

If you are incapable of looking around you and enjoying/appreciating that climb, then maybe what you're actually doing is chasing.

Chasing a certain account balance. Recognition. Spousal approval. Self validation.

If you're chasing, consider what it might be like to not need to chase anymore.

If you're climbing, keep climbing.

Shout out to Nate Navas for keeping this podcast going for the past 4 years, effectively creating a library of invaluable content.

**Community Responses:**

What should I do if I discover that the clinic owner, who is not a clinician, has been using my electronic signature to sign off on PTA notes while I was out of the country? I am located in Texas and would appreciate any recommendations or insights from anyone who has faced a similar situation. Should I seek legal advice, and are there any specific attorneys I can contact for assistance? Additionally, does the Texas Physical Therapy Association or APTA offer support or resources for addressing this type of issue?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a similar situation, I documented everything very very well, talked with a lawyer who sent a desist letter,  and immediately resigned to show good faith.  Maybe it was over the top but I was so pissed I didn’t care.  If anything, send all correspondence in email so there’s a paper trail

> **Response 2:** I would contact your professional liability insurance carrier as they should cover this and will have lawyers they want you to use. For anyone else reading, this is a good reason to have your own coverage, even if your company provides coverage as you are in control.

Assuming these are on federal payers as well (MC, TC etc) you could have a Qui Tam claim which once investigated can give you up to 15-30% of the total they recover from fraudulent claims (also there is retaliation protection). They would not just look at these false claims, but others across the clinic which could total goodness knows how much….

Hello everyone my name is Aiyinde Abraham I am a 3-year PT student in Alabama. I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this group. I am strongly considering starting a mobile-based practice after I graduate and I would like to offer my services in rural areas. Any suggestions or advice on what I should be doing to prepare myself to start my own practice? Or are there any suggestions on what I could and possibly should do to put myself in the best financial position as an upcoming new grad?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Commend your confidence but strongly recommend spending a year or 2 getting experience working side by side with experienced PTs. You learn a lot in school, however the real education happens when you start working.

> **Response 2:** I commend you for your vision and having the guts to start your own practice. Get as much experience as possible to determine where your niche or calling is. When you’re passionate about what you do, it really makes you focus on the goal and purpose. Learn from mentors on the ins & outs of private practice. Market to family and friends first. Then let them spread the word to their friends.

Odd question but here it goes.. so I am expecting my first baby this upcoming winter and I have started to tell my patients, some of which I have been with for years. I am a niche clinician specializing in breathing as it relates to motor pattern and postural dysfunction so a lot of my patients really rely on me, all of which I’m happy to serve. However, the news of my new mom status has not gone well with some patients, some even unwilling to receive the idea that I will not be seeing patients even before my delivery and of course for a few months after - my business, my rules. I have found other providers who I know and trust and are willing to collaborate to take on these patients but the patients refuse seeing anyone else. Honestly, it’s frustrating to say the least. I’m not sure what else I can do for them but it’s putting a damper on all this new exciting time for me. Any advice or thoughts on how to navigate?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** While I know you are wanting to do the best for your patients, your responsibility to them is only to give them adequate notice and try to assist them in finding other service while you are out on maternity leave and it sounds like you’ve done that.  It is ultimately their decision and their choice if the go with someone else, or take a break from PT.  If anyone is expecting you to not take time off for the birth of your baby and to recover afterward they are being selfish and honestly you’re probably better off without them.  You will build your business back up when you return.  Hopefully most of your patients who reacted badly to the news will come around with some time, they are just fearful of the change.

> **Response 2:** For the patients giving pushback, I’d say good riddance. If they can’t wait for you to return, then it was probably good to get them off the caseload anyway. No patient should ever make you feel like they are more important than your family.

My wife and I are planning on starting our own practice in June!  We want to go ahead and file for LLC and get an ein etc.  In everyone's experience would it be best just to file the LLC address as our home address, and change it later, since we wouldn't have a physical office location until June. Or better to keep that separate and have a p.o.box?

I realize when you become uncaged, you become so excited you want to join every everything. And the sound of “In network” is rejuvenating as if you are joining your local country club. That’s the problem. The verbiage is incorrect. Change up your vocabulary to what it really is. If you start using the following in lieu of in network, it might be more beneficial to you your business and your employees. ￼ start saying: 
“Insurance-friendly fleecing rates"

“In-network bargain basement reimbursements"

“Discounted care circus rates"

“Budget-friendly insurance swindle rates"

“In-network reimbursement discount extravaganza"

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** More patients, less money, and more paperwork are the ingredients for burnout soup.

> **Response 2:** It's a process.  We dropped some of our lower payers and got more money from same payers as an out of network provider.  It all depends on the insurance plan.

**Community Responses:**

I would never do google forms with all of the compliance and rules that need to be in there.

Taking part of my reply to someone else’s great question post. 
***
Why do people agree to pay cash to CAM specialists (Massage Therapists, Acupuncturists, Chiros, Personal Trainers) and Nutritionists and psychiatrists in Psychotherapists, yet fully expect insurance-based PT?

I think that the answer is somewhere in the following: 

PT as profession had a long journey to become recognized as a medical/healthcare field. Attaining medical recognition was a win and a loss. 

Today, two dfferent models of operation exist: 

Chiro + Personal Training + Massage = Wellness ~> Luxury: cash

PT = medical = necessity: insurance

Do we as PTs want to be associated with one or the other?

The answer is neither and both.
We need to carve a new model. And carving something new is… hard.

Maybe the answer is to change the Wellness to Wellbeing in branding? Or Wellbeing and Whole Health?

Like .. “Wellbeing in Function and Whole in Health PT?”

Dunno.

I am in the very beginning of thinking about my own practice, associated with an unexpected but a welcome move. 

I will be planning and carving, drafting and re-writing things. 

One thing that I will be doing from the very start is to brand my practice as the place where clients start to feel better about themselves and about the things they do for the living, for recreation, for fun and - for functional mobility. 

Because the whip of insurance-based PT is the mere functional gain. Our society insurance-based model is to pay for the person not to die, the rest is secondary.

I want people to be more than functional.  Beyond functional. 

Like… hurt by personal training -> seek Beyond Functional PT to return to sport.
… not responding to acupuncture 
-> seek Beyond Functional PT to relieve pain.

Not long time ago Massage Therapists started being recognized as professionals and not a subsidy of sex work industry.  Just 15 years ago I was asked by a client in a well-respected upscale spa if we do happy ending (I came to PT from being a LMT first). 

Somehow Massage Therapists are not recognized by Insurance as providers of medically necessary therapy (even though regular therapeutic massage greatly relives stress on par with Psychotherapy covered by insurance). 

We as a whole profession need a break from medical necessity equating negligent pay.  

And just maybe APTA need to step up too. But it’s a subject for the next rant.

Thanks for your attention.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I appreciate your rant. I do think there are a lot of people that (probably wrongly) associated cash pay with luxury and I think there is also that challenge of meeting undeserved patients that may not be able to access cash based care without insurance. 

Where I live there is a bit of a challenge convincing the masses that good health and wellness is an investment and figuring out where that lives in their priorities.

> **Response 2:** Excellent post and viewpoint. I am 100% in agreement with your point regarding whole health branding for improved functioning. I would love to continue this conversation among all of us therapists on this platform.

How many of you have used a digital marketing agency and are satisfied with the results?

Looking to get into the Meta/Google ads world, but no idea where to start. Hoping to find an affordable marketer who can manage and run the campaigns. I know there are a lot of them out there, and many are not good. What have been your experiences? If your super happy with yours, can you drop their contact info?

Thank you kindly!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Who are you trying to reach with Google/Meta ads? A local audience or a broader range of potential clients? 

My recommendation for Meta ads is Kwadwo. (Pronounced Quay-jo). I met him at a business conference and I really like his down-to-earth nature. I believe he would tell you if ads were going to be a waste of money or if it was the right move for your business. 

Here's his IG: 
https://www.instagram.com/quayjo/
He also had a podcast where you can get to know him more. Be sure to listen to the story of how he and his family were living in China but then got stuck in Mexico when Covid broke out - the wildest story ever!) 

I'm an OT and now run a marketing agency (focused on email marketing and sales funnels, plus a little LinkedIn ghostwriting). I've heard from way too many clinicians that the generic marketing agencies never really "got them", and the results were disappointing. It's a recurring theme in my discovery calls and it makes me so mad.

Most of the bigger agencies have someone who does the sales calls, and that person may understand... but then they subcontract it out to a cheap writer/designer who is just trying to get it done as fast as possible. They use ChatGPT to "understand" your specialty, but miss the mark with the messaging. 

I've also been targeted by a lot of PT clinic ads that are totally irrelevant to me since I don't live anywhere near them. So you're smart to find someone who can do ads well instead of "spray and pray"!

> **Response 2:** Speak with David Bayliff and Will Boyd. They will point you in the right direction

I have my  mobile based LLC and have a home health agency reach out to contract some of their patients to me, they want to pay $75 for follow up and $100 for eval. I feel like this is very low but wanted to see what you all think. Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Way too low. I would not go below 100 for tx and 150 for eval, and that is still low. One of our Therapists in our program on the east coast just negotiated 110 for tx and 165 for eval. No oasis.

> **Response 2:** This was and still is my business model. Sometimes I negotiate depending on if the HH patient is Medicare or Medicaid and trying to be respectful to the agency who is getting paid peanuts by the state for Medicaid patients. Also can negotiate if a PT vs PTA will be seeing them. Average is PT visit/eval $95 and then I add $30 for SOC/OASIS document. I occasionally lose $ on the PT visits but make it up on the margin of a PTA visit vs pay rate

**Community Responses:**

Each week featured: a lecture video with some drills, a weekly homework assignment, a zoom meeting to breakdown some videos submitted for homework and Q&A. The instructors are clinic owners that still treat patients and coach CrossFit  and are active fitness athletes themselves. Bonus you get lifetime access to the material so you can always refer back.

**Community Responses:**

Take time to learn about how you show up best at work, and do more of that. I love the Working Genius model for this. The assessment is about $20 I think, and well worth it. There is also a podcast by the same name that is honestly an amazing listen.

Take time to figure out the types of things that recharge you. MAKE TIME to do those things.

Take time to listen to your body. Learn how it tells you that you're stressed. And work with a counselor if possible to learn how to cope with the inevitable stress of life.

Give yourself permission to make beneficial changes.

If at all possible, work with a counselor.

I don’t know if this is allowed here, but I’m looking for a side hustle to hopefully get a little extra cash in to help me offset the high COL of SoCal. (If I could move-I would). I wanted to reach out here first to see if anyone is interesting in hiring someone like me to help with bookkeeping, scheduling, or transcribing your notes, etc. I’m a COTA by trade in home health. I am also a medical laboratory scientist and was in management at an ALF for some time, handling budgets, family communications, documents, etc. I have tons of experience. I do work full time in home health still, so it would be very part time and flexibility on hours is requested. Not looking for anything crazy on pay- hoping we can help each other in this area.

**Community Responses:**

Have a PT who is pregnant and is going to be taking maternity leave.

She doesn’t qualify for FMLA as she just started working 5 months ago. But we do have paid maternity leaveve

My question: we offer 6 weeks of maternity leave that’s paid. How do I go about asking her how long she plans on taking off? Like if she wanted to take more after those 6 weeks. Just so we have a start back date that we can transition her patients back to her. Do we go ahead and set that now?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** YES - talk now. Just know that plans may change. But, have an idea in your head of how things may/may not play out. 

Talk with her, as if she was your own daughter, sister, wife, friend, etc. 

In my past personal experiences working for someone else, the more they treated me like a human, with kindness and understanding, the more I respected and desired to please my employer. 

It’s sad, but most leaders don’t get this. Men, in particular. 

Demonstrating kindness, empathy, or compassion when communicating is not a sign of weakness. **You can be a strong leader while still being kind.

Obviously, when an employee takes advantage of the employer’s kindness or empathy, that is an issue. The employer must take action to ensure it doesn’t happen more than once. 

Giving each employee the benefit of the doubt, in the beginning, is the best approach, in my opinion. 

Be direct and honest with her about YOUR needs as an employer/business owner, while simultaneously demonstrating understanding for her situation. 

Any reasonable person understands you need to ensure you have a physical PT in the clinic to treat clients until she returns. 

Let us know how the talk goes - interested to hear how it plays out!

> **Response 2:** First things first… way to go offering some paid maternity leave. That is a huge blessing for families! 

Secondly, I’d just request a meeting and chat about it! Then recheck in at the 6 week mark in case she changes her mind so you have time to adapt.

So I thought I had the beginning figured out, I went through Bootcamp and my last day at my fulltime job was July 1.

2 days ago, I applied for my LLC registration which ended up getting cancelled because I used the wording, physical therapy and wellness. Incfile.com said those words require me to file a pllc in Texas. Fine... but most online platforms don't do pllcs. I found one called mycorporation.com but I have no idea if this is reputable.  Similar cost structure to Legal zoom, etc. $100 for the basics plus extra for EIN, business licenses, annual reports. (Are these things hard to do yourself?) Versus $900 through the lawyer I contacted. I don't know what else I need... are their business licenses I need other than my own license and EIN? I'm doubting my own common sense and feeling stupid and indecisive.  I just want to get started legally, safely.

If you had an “easy” job making $125k/salary a year (in a low cost living area) - would you still make the leap to being Uncaged? 

Wanting to hear both sides. I’ve had PTs say I’m crazy for considering leaving. IVe had PTs say I’m crazy for not leaving. (If anyone doesn’t care, I’d love to know how much YOU made last year as an uncanged clinician)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I left a job I loved making a little less than that to be home with my son, which is priceless. I have an online business and work while he naps, and will be replacing my PT salary this year. 

I think it depends on the quality of clinics available to you, the energy that particular job gives or takes away, as well as familial circumstances.

> **Response 2:** The answer is it always depends. Depends on your stage in life. Depends on what you want to risk. I left a 125k job to start my private practice and now obviously make more than that. 😁😁😁

I say go for it. The 124k job will always be there. The opportunity to be Uncaged and start a business won't be there. Don't live a life of regrets. YOLO. 😁😁😁

I wanted to give a shout out to the UNCAGED program! Initially, when I began Pathway, I was lost and didn’t know how to start or navigate my business. In fact, I didn’t believe that the program will work for me. However, I decided to immerse myself in the program anyway. In one year, I had learned and experienced a substantial personal and business growth. From learning how to personally approach and acquire patients, properly handle business finances and overcoming my limiting beliefs. I want to extend my gratitude the UNCAGED coaches: David Bayliff and Kevin DeGroot, Josh Payne, Hanna DeGroot and Cara Bayliff… I would highly recommend the Uncaged team if you are trying to start a PT business and are tired of feeling caged in your corporate position…I’m glad I did!

How do you educate patients about the difference between Medicare and Medicare replacement plans?  I take medicare, and patients keep saying they have medicare, and I get them all signed up, and then find out it's replacement, add they don't understand why they would have to pay.  😬

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They should have read the book they're given each year to explain how their health services are billed. 😑  If in person, ask to see their cards first. If not, have them email a copy. You need that to verify coverage anyway. Tell them up front you don't take Medicare Advantage plans. If they are not paying anything extra each month than their $174.90 that is usually subtracted from their Social Security payments, they probably have an Advantage plan. Although some Advantage plans have extra premiums as well. Sounds like their Insurance agent didn't educate them well. It's the job of the agent to make sure they understand their coverage. I would direct them back to their agent if you don't want to spend the time. 

Traditional Medicare is quite costly. I remember my mom paying up to $454 a month over her base premium (now $174.90). And she wasn't really ill until her last year alive. Only hospitalized for 2 TIAs and having 3 children. You are going to see more and more taking Advantage plans. They have a max out of pocket limit that lowers the financial risk. If you are not an ill person, Advantage plans make sense. Plus you get dental and vision benefits, and other perks. Otherwise you are paying close to $600 a month for Insurance you may or may not use

> **Response 2:** I ask for their cards before, check benefits. If they have Advantage I explain they chose to give up their Medicare benefits to an insurance company who now “manages” their health care like any other insurance company. I then refer them to another PT clinic that may take their insurance. The Advantage plans are absolutely awful and predatory and should be illegal the way they prey on our elders.

Trying to find a different way to say that we are busy to patients and we are getting so many new patients that we can’t get them in soon. Having to schedule new patients 2-3 weeks out. 

Like “we won’t have an opening until mid-may but I can put you on our cancellation list for an earlier opening. We do apologize but our patient volume is high”

Or what’s a better/more professional way to say it?

I’m so grateful of how busy I am but I don’t want it to negatively impact my practice because patients can’t get in. I am also looking to hire asap so that will help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The best way to say it without saying it is to raise prices.

> **Response 2:** A lot of times this is only viewed negatively from our lens.

Think of all the times you’ve heard a patient say “dr. Xyz is so good I couldn’t get an appointment until July”. Popular restaurants sometimes require reso weeks in advance.

Being on a waitlist or scheduling out can create demand and a sense of scarcity in the eyes of consumers. Give yourself a break (and a pat on the back), hire when you can, and preserve your boundaries and time. Very rarely is PT an emergency scenario that can’t wait a few weeks.

Where is your focus?

Wait. What?

Sunday, I was helping my daughter with her tennis. She simply wants to be able to hit with her friends who are better.

I finally realized that I was giving her the same feedback that I’ve given to many many others who were looking to improve their game, which was “YES!” when the STROKE was desirable.

Not if the ball went in, or it was an amazing shot.

I told her that she probably wondered why I seemed excited on shots that, in her head, weren’t good shots.

I mean, some balls even went over the SIDE fence.

I said here’s why:

If you want to improve faster, you’re going to do so by understanding what you are doing right rather than worrying about what the outcome looks like.

In other words, get the process down, strengthen your foundations, and you will get a lot more right, hit a lot more good shots.

So, where is YOUR focus?

Is it “I can’t get people to say Yes” - outcome focused

Or…

Is it learning an effective process that helps people to understand with clarity how you can help them- principle focused.

Something to think about …

Lesli JenkinsJosh PayneDavid BayliffKevin DeGroot

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The safer bet would be to insure yourself individually and insure the company itself especially if you have employees. The whole point is for individuals not to sue you personally or go after your personal assets. You can definitely ask several people about this including your insurance agent, your CPA, or your small business attorney. You will have to calculate the risk on your part to determine the benefit of insuring both and how much patient care you're actually doing.

Suddenly the ONLY outpatient neuro clinic in the south half of your town (which happens to be the third largest city in your state) is abruptly closing. 
Now all you can think about is what color to paint the walls, office locations, how many hi-low tables you need, structured mentoring programs, and what songs to put on the clinic playlist.

If you’re wondering about your value and how much to charge, in my community people charge $70/hr or $350-$500 to set up and decorate a Christmas tree with client-provided ornaments. We have to know AND show our value to our clients.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yeah very rich people pay that. The large majority of America is paycheck to paycheck. I’ve said this before… PT isn’t a one and done. You can probably get a lot of people to pay 300 bucks for an eval where you give them some great advice and get them going, but the large majority of people are not paying close to that 10-30 times. I’m sure some will say they’ve done it but i haven’t had many people who ended PT after 6 visits unless it was an active person with an ankle sprain.

> **Response 2:** 1x a year compared to multiple times per week....

Does anyone here charge a flat fee “extra” for same day and/or holiday appointments? I never have, but I have one patient specifically who always contacts me asking for an appt that same day, often within hours. Sometimes I can, and I do. Sometimes I do not have childcare set up since it wasnt a prior made appt, and I turn down the appt that day. Now, if I can make it work, I do and always have, but the incentive of extra charge if requesting an appt within hours seems appealing but also maybe not haha. 

What about holidays?

Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Charge extra for holidays/vacations and out of hours visits. 
I’ve lived by this and some clients don’t care and some do. They schedule to what fits their needs. I’m also a strong believer in “no” is a full sentence. You can treat them if you want or not without explanation. 

Your practice- you do it how it best suits you. 

PS- did the holiday rates last year for PT visits because I had intended  to take off for the holiday. Got inundated with calls for visits. Upped my rates and no one complained. So guess whose rates went up 😉 sometimes it’s a nice way to see if a price increase will be accepted by your clientele. 

Good luck!

> **Response 2:** For holidays and outside of normal hours makes sense… same day I don’t. I just get excited I can fill a gap

I currently see all of my patients out of my brick and mortar and am all cash based. I just received a message from someone reaching out about doing home visits for their friend who had a stroke because transportation is difficult. It sounds like she is about 15 minutes from my office. Do I charge the same prices as my office visits or more because I need to travel and delegate more time for these appointments to accommodate the travel?  My heart says charge the same but my mind says increase the cost due to the increased time it will take out of my day. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is there any way you can fill the time in your space with someone else while you’re out? I have a client I see 2x/wk at his house. I’m there for about an hour and block 15 min on each side for travel. I was able to find a yoga teacher who uses that hour to teach a class while I’m gone. I get a small cut and the space isn’t sitting unused.

> **Response 2:** I work for a California based home health agency, and the per session rate for PT is $374. Just an FYI to compare your own rate to.

Today my patient had a genius idea!!! Insurance companies give their patients a set amount (say 10) PT sessions each year. They can be for a problem or preventative like ergonomics!!! In the end they would pay less for meds and surgery!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** One of the main reasons our healthcare system is as broke as it is is because of how frequently people change insurance providers. Because of this, insurance companies see preventative healthcare as lining the pockets of their competitors. 

To market this, you would want to pursue a large corporation (the pull with insurance companies) that has an abnormally low degree of employee turnover (benefit from keeping employees healthy).

> **Response 2:** There is a company named Centene. They actually bought a medium size company that specialized in doctor visits at home and used it to prevent hospitalizations and save money. A managed system like that would be the company to pitch it to.

Does or has anyone seen a patient 2x a week for maintenance? Let’s say neuro conditions a like MS or Parkinson’s

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes but you need to have strong documentation for objective measures and impact on quality of life. You also need to vary your frequency to show the patient declines in quality of life and function with less therapy.

> **Response 2:** I have done this with 2 Medicare patients in the past. It took a lot of documentation and coordination with their provider to sign off on it when needed. The one was younger and was on disability his whole life due to a rare neuro disorder. We had years of history of him doing regular PT, discharging, declining and returning to PT. He did so well with the maintenance program! He was able to start working and eventually took a full time job that was flexible with him and he was able to get off Medicare disability! Last I heard he was still working and loving it. I was so proud of him.

I've been subletting at a day spa for 3 years, i pay rent, talk to the spa owner almost every day. Last night she messages me that we have all been locked out of the office due to non payment. Landlord will not let me back in to get my stuff until spa pays rent. She is hopefull that she can  pay by Friday and we can get back to work (best case scenario), worst case scenario is i have to find another space by Monday to continue (It's just me, i no longer have staff). I am in Texas and just wondering if anyone has some great legal suggestions or if you have lived this hell before. Somehow it never occured to me that she was not paying rent. I will not post anonymously, and being in a small town, will do my best not to say to much about her.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Update: I got my stuff out of the spa yesterday thanks to the landlord, and this weeks location I am officing out of my parents empty rent house. Adapt and roll!!

> **Response 2:** Brenda, what does your contract say for the sublease? There’s normally provisions in them for things like this.  At the very least, I would be starting to look around for a new location.  This is clearly not someone you can trust with your business.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Samy Dees it’s always the mean ol Capitalists’ fault. PT should be about helping and healing people while getting paid or paying yourself what you’re worth.  The beauty of capitalism is that if you don’t like what you’re getting paid you can always go work somewhere else or start your own biz. Under any other economic model if you don’t like what you’re getting paid - tough.

I have a patient with Aetna in our physical therapy clinic. He has insurance but a high deductible. So we charged him our self pay rate of $180. And when we billed his insurance they deducted $160 from his deductible. Patient called us and said that we owe him $160. 

How do we tell him that we did not get paid $160, that’s just the amount that his insurance plan took off his deductible. And we charge every single patient $180 if they have not reached their deductible.

Do I have to reimburse him the difference of $20?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting no one knows the answer or able to provide easy clear source 🙄 

All for a hard, laborious, mediocre pay job that's greatly needed. 

I call waste, fraud and abuse on the bureaucracy of the professsion. Doctorate required but yet no one can tell you how to bill for services 🙄

> **Response 2:** Lots of incorrect info here. 

Sounds like his plan only had 160 of an allowed amount. Doesn’t mean you’re limited to the allowed amount. 

Remember there’s technically no sure thing as in network and out of network. 

There’s contracted and non-contracted. There’s a difference.

I find it saddening how vigorously some  will defend the limitations of our ability to serve people. I’m talking about the issues with serving people who may be Medicare recipients with coaching or wellness, teasing out the nuances of skilled or unskilled care. I don’t understand why some are so vigilant at chastising therapists who attempt to serve people based on their incredible training and skill set. Therapists who are trying to serve people that are begging for help. Therapists that are trying to stay passionate about a career they love and a system that has broken so many of us, and leaves many patients floundering for support that is reliable and professional. I know that many of the comments are designed to protect people and their license. However,￼ I don’t understand why we are not outraged that this, limitation even exists.  I don’t understand why professionals like us defend it instead of saying this is utterly ludicrous, and we must change it. ￼ I have personally struggled to find care for a family member that needed specific rehab services and none were available for weeks and weeks. This was in a reasonably large metro area and I’m sure I’m not alone.  How is it even reasonable that we should not pay cash for someone that could support us in a timely fashion? ￼ We can do better. We can make a change. We can serve more people that need us. 
￼ I’m not arguing the rules that are written. I’m arguing how absolutely ridiculous they are and that we should be more outraged that they exist than trying to defend them. ￼ Rant over. Please recognize this came from struggling to find help for a loved one.  Seeing it from the patient side is heartbreaking. ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The whole Medicare thing is ridiculous. You should be able to see whoever you want with your own money.

> **Response 2:** I’m pretty sure the limitation exists to protect Medicare beneficiaries from being bewildered and scammed.  

Having said that, I don’t agree with the limitations, but I think what you sense as some people vehemently defending the rule isn’t that at all.  It’s exasperation at the number of professionals in our field who have such an incredibly poor grasp of the current law before they jump into business.  

People jump on here every day asking questions about how they can treat Medicare patients for cash and then people respond every day citing the mandatory claims submissions regulation and skilled vs unskilled and it is exhausting to see the sheer number of people who don’t understand it - whether you agree or not. 

And I think that is mostly proof that most of us are caregivers relying on fb groups to teach us instead of doing the work of properly setting up our businesses. 

So I don’t think you are sensing that anyone is defending the rule.  We are however defending the need to know the rules if you are going to be in business.

I already saw 1 and sold a 10 pack and he schedule out 7/10 sessions already. 🤯🤯🤯🤯 I even raised my price and client had no problems!!! He saw a value ! He felt better in 1 sessions ! Did I fix him!! Noooo! I listened to him and his concerns ! I made him feel important and empower him to change his health!!! 

I am seeing a ultra runner today !!! 

What I am trying to say !! Keep taking  small steps and put  yourself out there. Keep showing to local runs / events based on your nitch !! I even bring my son and daughter to community run ! People see I am human and caring for running community !!!

> **Response 1:** This happened to me - a lawyer/PT advised me to Finish the notes on paper, do it as a simple SOAP and drop it off/ certify mail. And let them know you have destroyed any digital copies. That way you can meet your licensure demands.

> **Response 2:** That’s not right at all…their loss

I am curious about diagnostic msk ultrasound and specifically using it with dry needling. I would love if anyone has gone this route that I could talk to? 
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Caleb Walls!

> **Response 2:** Spinal Manipulation Institute (AAMT) has the DN-3 class which is specifically tailored to exactly what you are stating you want to know more about. Not only could you get some CEU’s, but the course is invaluable to clinicians and patients. I use MSK US daily, especially for US guided needling for tendinosis, fasciosis, etc and the patients typically are delighted that the specific symptoms they have are precisely reproduced during intervention, and that the root of their problem has been found. James Escaloni (who commented above) above has taught me most of what I know about MSK US and may arguably be one of the best in the world at what he does.

Hey all. I have a severe thoracic outlet case who is awaiting thoracic surgeon appointment. Long hx of pain and has been in and out of PT for 2 years with some relief but nothing long lasting. It appears to be true vascular compression. I am trying to alleviate some of her symptoms leading up to the appointment. Are there any unique go to techniques you all have found helpful in these cases? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Muscle energy technique and even SCS have powerful techniques for  TOS..

> **Response 2:** Check for hypermobility at the shoulder as well. My best friend from PT school had an unrelenting case of thoracic outlet and also scores a 7-8 on the Beighton scale (I forget her exact score). Whenever she would carry things, the traction on her shoulder was contributing significantly to her TOS. She was able to largely resolve her symptoms with a lot of work on shoulder stabilization. She also did a lot of work to improve her awareness so she could rely more on active vs passive support of the shoulder, especially with lifting/carrying.

Looking for some billing advice.... 

I currently work at a hospital based outpatient clinic. I usually feel that their ethics are good, but I’ve recently started dry needling and was educated to bill it as manual therapy. I don’t feel comfortable with this, but they haven’t been willing to set up a cash pay system for dry needling. Do I continue to dry needle and not bill for it? Or just tell them I will no longer be providing dry needling services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The answer is actually really simple. The Insurnace companies tell you. I can’t answer for you as it depends on where you are but all Insurnace companies very specifically tell you what to bill and if covered In their medical guidelines. Just a quick google search…. Hope that helps

> **Response 2:** I'm not sure why you feel it isn't manual therapy? 
Imo, with PT services, our time should be reimbursed the maximum amount, because it shouldn't matter what we choose to do in our tx session; it should all be up to us. Why would we not get the best reimbursement for our time?

Hello! I was wondering what the top notch weight lifting certification programs are? Preferably one non biased to thick thighs 😂

In undergrad I would beat most classmates in the 1 and 2 mile races we had, placing third in female/male races. I beat everyone in the class in the blindfolded balance board exercises. We had university BB players, lacrosse players and football players in that class. And I lasted longer running while having VO2max tested. That was great because it smashed misconceptions about big girls and the re-defined what “fit” or “athletic” means. I have a couple weight lifting courses I’m looking at but they seem very generic. Any and all advice appreciated 🏋️‍♀️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would go for the CFMA Cert from ICE. It will cover the Olympic lifts plus a lot more and be much more applicable across the board for many types of fitness athletes. This is coming from someone with an Olympic Weightlifting background and the USAW level 1. Unless you only want to work with Weightlifters, but they will likely look for someone who has weightlifting experience before coming to you to be honest.

> **Response 2:** Another vote for the ICE CMFA certification, I'm so glad I did that over USAW to get started. It changed my lifts immediately in the gym and also gave awesome groundwork to start treating active people that love/need to lift. Also great crew of people to get involved with in general!

Has anyone tried like non synchronous video/virtual eval and programming for people? scenario - gym member tells me he has shoulder pain but can’t take time off work to attend a formal visit in office. We trouble shoot via videos and messages back and forth and then create a program for him to do. Its slower of a process but we could make it more fluid with q-a form for them to fill out with a video. Charge for 30 min or hour for time taken to use PT skills to do set time frame for services (6-8 weeks etc) Follow up 1-2x a week as needed. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

I’m 2 years into running my own mobile part B business and have kept busy schedule throughout this time, however the process of staying busy gets frustrating. I have 2 doctors offices, one social worker and a couple med A therapists who are main referral sources. It seems that unless I’m reaching out with a “hey if you have any patients who are in need of PT, I have immediate availability”, they don’t refer. Feel like I constantly have to nudge and annoy these people, but it works so far. I’ve shown my appreciation by ordering lunch on numerous occasions. They all say they have patients in need of home PT, but yet don’t reach out… anyone else feel the same way/have the same struggles?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You have to realize that those offices see dozens of people like you walk in and out of their offices with luncheons, brochures, etc.  Whether it's from pharm reps, radiology reps, or PTs.  You have to stand out to make sure they think of you first when referring a patient to home PT.  Otherwise it's just another one of many free lunches from a "rep".  Get to know the front desk personnel..those are the people that actually hand the list of PTs to the patients.  I went so far as to offer PT to one of these front desk personnel that needed PT.  Once they see how you stand out from otherwise, they will tell patients to go to you when patients ask, "which PT on this list is the best?"

> **Response 2:** Word of mouth has worked best for me. No md. People tell others

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pay someone to do it. 

They have more data and history to know what works.

or paying an agency and ad spend. 

I know that paid ads on social are not usually necessary for smaller practices looking to only generate 25 or so clients a month. 

There are more reliable less costly ways that are a better alternative for many.

Hey friends!!
Can someone give me advice on the best way to go about creating a website that looks professional and is relatively simple to create? Total newbie here with doing this type of thing. We have our logo and domain is secured :) Thank you in advance!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** To get off the ground, you really just need a one page website that covers the basics. Then after you’re earning $$ and know your target audience and message more you can expand and add pages. 

You can keep the blog hidden until you want to actually commit to writing consistently. 

I usually recommend Squarespace or Wix for beginners and then you’ll be able to modify things yourself instead of paying a designer. 

You’ll rewrite your website a few times, so don’t put a ton of pressure on yourself for the first version. Just make sure the feel and message are on point for your target audience.

ISOLATION: The second great killer of your business 

You weren't meant to do THIS alone and by "THIS" I don't just mean business. 

Scenario 1: I hate when people outside a select few friends ask me how business is going. It doesn't seem fair to have to communicate something as complicated as an entrepreneur's emotions. It's great, it's terrible, it's ok, it's frustrating, it's exhilarating, it's everything at the same time. So most of the time people ask I simply say "it's going well" and leave it at that. 

The problem with this? It puts you on an island feeling that no one can possibly understand or know what you're going through. 

Scenario 2: there's something that's been engrained in you from your childhood- using other people to help you is cheating, you need to do it on your own, group projects are awful, and if you collaborate with someone it cheapens what you're accomplishing. 

All of these things have gone through my head from time to time. I want to prove to everyone that I can do it on my own and don't need to rely on support or help from outsiders. "I didn't borrow money from a wealthy family member to get started." "I'm the reason people are coming to my practice." "I'm going to see how far I can get it on my own before asking for help." 

Phrases like this are so prevalent in our culture. 

Both of these scenarios create a pattern of isolation that make us susceptible to a number of problems. We burn out because we can't sustain the level of energy we're putting in. We quit because there's no accountability to push through challenges. We feel depressed because we're alone. 

At the very least you don't need to do this alone but the honest truth is that doing this alone is irresponsible. Don't let yourself become susceptible to isolation. Surround yourself with community to support you and allow you to have the greatest opportunity to have true success.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good timing. Rough day!

> **Response 2:** Perfect timing for this!  Ty! 
I’m a bit tired of the island lately ❤️

Curious… I have a private cash based OP “side gig” currently. I am considering going full time. A challenge I have currently though, is when I get calls from potential clients, I explain why we are cashed based, but that we do provide a superbill that they can send in to be reimbursed if preferred. It’s usually at this point that they are no longer interested. Today I had someone say “I just know I won’t send it in.”

I am thinking of taking this part on myself if I do go full time (until I can hire admin/billing). 

I would still collect cash day of service but then submit the superbill for them (which indicates that the patient should be reimbursed). Can I do this? And if so, is there a certain way I have to do it as the provider?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would love to know this to

> **Response 2:** I’d suggest improve your selling skills instead of going down that rabbit hole. It’s much more in your control and a hell of a lot less headaches in the long run

I saw the recent post about a CEU course for ANF therapy, and after looking into it I have to be 💯honest in that my BS meter went off the hook, and I consider myself pretty open to some of the more nebulous treatment ideas and approaches. 🤷🏻‍♂️  My question to the group is what all has been your experience with it? Is it worth it? Are there other companies beside the one mentioned that offer products where you don’t need to do thousands of $ in trainings to become licensed? I’m genuinely curious, and feel free to message me directly if you don’t want to offend anyone!😂 Link to the company referenced is below.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I practice it with every single private client and I’ve consistently gotten better outcomes 2-3 times faster compared to without it (I also work insurance based part time and I’ve tracked similar cases). There are results that still shock me to this day after using it for 3 years in ways that I can’t explain as just placebo—like Kevin DeGroot mentioned too. 

Pain relief, restored motion and function in the first session, far quicker recovery time than with my manual therapy skill set + standard PT (and I also get good results already with manual techniques and pain neuroscience education, etc). 

I’ve used it on my competitive athletes and those with chronic pain and comorbidities when “nothing else is working” and both groups and those in between have been blown away by how fast and lasting this stuff is. 

It’s great because even on that initial treatment, my clients walk out the door with an average of 40-50% improvement on symptoms and restoration of activity progresses more consistently. 

I had a rancher with a ruptured biceps who couldn’t even put on his shirt or flex his arm above 60 degrees with chronic shoulder pain and within the same visit we got him to 160 flexion and putting his jacket back on pain free and then four weeks later he was roping cattle again. 

I’ve also had a lymphedema protocol on a swollen leg experience like Kevin mentioned and watching it “deflate” as the swelling left in real time…both the client and my faces were 😮😮

Had a lady with sciatica and none of the traditional PT strengthening, stretching, or manual was helping her, but when I treated with her a gut protocol, and nothing on her sciatic nerve or associated hip muscles, her pain halved just as is. 

If you’re into whole-organism treatment, once you start learning and practicing with ANF, you see how everyone’s nervous system needs to be treated—much like how we can’t turn off our gait analysis eyes. 😆

Just getting on here to see if anybody has recommendation 

Scenario 17yr suffered a Stroke/basil artery ischemia and Acute rehab TIRR Houston Tx saying she is medically stable to be released in a week & needs to be set up for OP rehab. Her home is west of FT Worth 45 miles in rural town Where would you go???? 

I’m trying to help this dear family, they are lost & TIRR doesn’t know our area for referral. 
She needs extensive therapy still non verbal & min movement in extremities but cognitively there.  
Any help would be appreciated. 🙏🙏🙏🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** “Rehab without walls” is neuro home health and they are excellent, sometimes can start there first then get her to outpatient.

> **Response 2:** Baylor day neuro, cns, pate. Whatever her insurance will cover for intensive therapy!! Also check rehab without walls and collage. That’s intensive home health. Much more than your average home health and it’s all neuro based!! 

With all of these you would get ot/pt/st, social work, neuropsych.

Hello all! I have a liability insurance question for you all. I’ve been using MyPTInsurance, and I pay roughly $300 a year. I see a lot of posts where people are paying closer to $1,000 a year, can anyone provide any guidance if I’m adequately covered using this policy? Photo of coverage attached. Thanks team!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is what I use as well.  I paid an extra fee extra dollars to list all the companies I work/ contract for in addition to my own small mobile practice.  But it's still way cheaper than others. Less than 400.

> **Response 2:** If you let them know you don’t do medication management or wound care it’s usually much cheaper

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** Put some boundaries such as pretend you have a secretary direct it to your business number and send them an intake form they can fill out so that you can automatically look into their case. Emphasize that they need to fill it out in order to proceed to step 2.

I am SAHM of 10 months old, not planning to join work for atleast next 6 months, But m stressed out a lot at home and thinking if I can start something from home like stretching sessions and wellness which will not include skilled services.
Note: I am a resident of KY and have Indiana PT license.
My question is what can I do to legally start these services at my home, do I need to get certification in stretching, then I start?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Why would you need a stretching certificate if you're a PT? You need liability insurance and can do anything within your scope and practice.

> **Response 2:** Why not do virtual PT sessions and market in Indiana

Geriatric PTs- what services are you offering to your patients that are not covered by Medicare to increase revenue/ visit???  One of my 2026 goals is to offer more cash pay services in addition to typical Medicare PT session, looking for inspiration.  Right now the only one I currently offer is dry needling.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love that you are asking this question. A lot depends on what you or your team really enjoys doing. 

You already know but I generate the extra income we need through media and affiliate income. 

Selling products is usually an easy one to add. With Amazon’s next day delivery on a lot of items you could easily buy and resell stuff like little pedal exercisers, walking pads, etc. 

Other services like taking your client out of the house, go to a game, go to the park, go run some errands. As long as you are out of the house it is not a covered service. 

We had a PTA who would travel with patients on cruises. This one is a bit more extreme but he got the free trip and set hours that he was “on duty.” He was paid for that time and could do what he wanted the rest of the time. I could see this working for flights as well.

Need some thoughts on an opportunity. I currently treat both MCR and cash pts with my fully mobile practice . I charge $150/visit. I was approached by a local country club with a large membership. They would like me to treat their members at the club. They would take 20% of monies. I told them $175/ visit (the idea is to recoup the 20%).  I would be there for maybe 4-5 hrs at a clip. Am I being greedy to ask for the $175/visit? Thoughts on $175 for eval and then $150 return visits? Thanks, everyone!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Someone in a pelvic floor group I follow put it this way: “I just paid $200 to have a clown at my kids bday party for an hour”. Consider that when setting your rates.

> **Response 2:** I’ve actually have done this in the past. Worked well but the must earn their 20% , I believe it was 20% for me as well 

1. You cannot treat Medicare there unless you get that site blessed by Medicare 
2. The country club better have all the equipment you need to effectively do your job 
3. The country club likely will be handling all the money up front ie drawing from their members accounts on a monthly basis   So you need to ensure your books are accurate so they pay you correctly 
4. The country club should assist you on scheduling their members with their front desk/spa staff. 
5. They should also market on your behalf as 20% of 10 clients vs 100 clients is much more advantageous to them. 
6 your rates seem low but all of that is area dependent, and what you are comfortable charging. We aee 275 eval 175 follow up 350 ultrasound diagnostics. Commonly an eval will pull in $625 in an hour  and the members love it.

Now really. Do you think this patient really cares if I am in or out of network 🫣 that’s it …$10 more. But OON can prob fix in half the Visits in network can. So it actually saves time and money.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So is this someone you can just provide a super bill to for them to give to their insurance? Or are you someone that takes insurance (trying to learn how to navigate)

Hey team, 

I’m excitied to say I’ll officially be Uncaged by September 15th! That being said, I need to find a “reasonable” health insurance or health share option. I have an HSA so I’m fine with high deductible plans. It would be for myself, my wife, and our 7mo old daughter. 

I appreciate any advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just went thru this process.  I can tell you the marketplace has high deductible hmo plans surprisingly affordable in my case. I had a insurance broker help me navigate marketplace.  Also texas farm bureau has a high deductible plan fairly comparable. Not sure if that is option where you live.   Other than that I'd try a health share company like medi share.  For me these three options the only ones that made remotely any sense.

Phone service.

I haven't seen any updated posts in a while.  I'd be curious on opinions for multiple people.  Cost effective, no landline, HIPAA compliant phone, texts, call forwarding, etc.  Also, don't need another fax system but do need my phone number ported over.

Any input on these:

-Google voice (haven't heard all good things)
-Grasshopper (don't know much about it)
-sideline
-8x8
-any other good ones?

So I have a few days where my space is underutilized in the evenings. I had a PTA come and ask if she could rent it to do this specialized stretching thing she does on the side of working for a corporate company to make more money. She charges her pts $100/hr and wants to give me 20% of each patient she sees. She will be there after hours or on days only when  I’m not in. Thoughts on that rate and ideas on how to regulate this so I’m not getting jipped but also HIPAA complaint? She seems like a really good respectful person with a good business sense and all that jazz but I still want to protect myself etc. 

Note she will be using her own table and equipment etc. 

TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds like a good deal. Maybe could move to an where she leases once she get a good amount. I do the same in my practice I subleased out for $400 first 3 months and then raise to $700 if they want exclusive use of room. If they don’t want exclusive use. I charge them $20 for 1 hour use but don’t allow them to store things there.

> **Response 2:** Not sure you need to worry about HIPAA. Is she’s just doing stretching it’s wellness and would be like someone doing personal training not a medical treatment. Unless I am misunderstanding your question.

Hi 👋 My name is Irina !! I just wanted to share my day today. What being uncaged means to me. I was able to spend today with my oldest son 1-1 quality care !! It’s priceless and at night they came with me to community run 🏃🏼‍♀️ to promote RunRocket Physical Therapy and Wellness!!! 

I feel so blessed and grateful 😇 I have full control of my schedule and I can spend time with my children !! I can see it’s making a huge impact on them in positive way !!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s the best feeling isn’t it?  On Tuesday I saw an 8:00 patient came home took my daughter to figure skating, went out and saw two more patients and came back to make dinner for the family and watch my son’s swim meet. Earned as much money as working 13 hours at my previous job where I would have had to see about 25 patients at least. Been full time in my business a year now and it still feels like I’m cheating. Haha I guess 20 years of being conditioned to work for someone else will do that.

I know this question has been asked, but I still haven’t found the perfect solution…

I’m looking for a web based phone and text message solution for my business. I already have a phone number to port, but I would like to have the ability to add extensions to that number to route to my other therapists cell phones, so that they don’t have to give their cell phone number to patients. Also need the ability to send/receive text messages from that phone number.

I don’t need any fancy system that can send out marketing campaigns or extra services…just the basics.

I currently have 8x8, but their customer support and inability to solve text message issues is frustrating. Currently paying about $70/month, so looking to stay in that range.

Any suggestions appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look into dialpad. I don’t know all specifics but do know it has the capabilities that you’re describing

> **Response 2:** Just switched to Dialpad and really like it! Went from ring central… stay away!

Has anyone here bought an existing PT business? I may have a perfect opportunity to take over a PTs brick and mortar in my hometown as he’s retiring. I’m not sure what questions to ask and how to go about this. Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I bought one in 2020. Took over for a couple PTs who were getting out of the game. Definitely a lot of questions I didn't think to ask; now that I've been at it for a while, I'd want morr specific info. Big ones were: payer mix, clinical operation metrics, admin metrics, and terms of the deal (huge one)

> **Response 2:** I have bought a practice from a retiring PT and exited a PT business as well. I would be happy to discuss whatever questions you may have. If I cannot answer them I can refer you to a CPA and M and A attorney that I work with.

Does anyone have experience on how to hire a new therapist? I have been working to many hours. What is the best way to advertise? LinkedIn seems expensive. What do you think of indeed? Do you have your new therapist sign a contract? iI so any suggestions on where to go to learn how to make a contract? Or do I need a lawyer? (just not sure what to put on the contract. ) ￼ would appreciate anyone’s experience. I have been hesitating, because I’m not sure what I’m getting myself into🙃 any advice on this subject would be appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Local networking. And indeed. I just use the free posting. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** As a PT looking for jobs, indeed is where I go (military spouse, we have moved often). However, I would definitely go with word of mouth within your network first.

For mobile therapists that went to brick and mortar did you notice patients taking you "more seriously"?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had the opposite! My one client took her physician's suggestion to try a "traditional physical therapy office" because they have more equipment blah blah blah.... well I encouraged her and said you know what give it a try, you never know. Well she called me last night saying she was paying a 40 copay for her to be passed around or being alone to do stupid exercises such as marching and standing side leg lifts...when she could have just stated with me to not waste time. She's angry with the physician and plans to tell her physician about how in home is fantastic because you have the sole providers full attention without distraction.

> **Response 2:** We had a strong following that went from renting out space in a gym and doing some private calls for $$$. Then covid happened and we went pure mobile.  Then got our own space   

Each time the business leveled up so to speak we saw a great deal of increased respect.  Especially from other providers.   

But when my wife and I had our first kid. Patients that previously would t pay for the cash services just changed over quickly.  “You have little mouths to feed… I will pay extra for extra quality “   
Keep in mind these are patients that had known my wife and I 10 years from dating to engaged to married to married with children.

Hello All , I just opened my own practice last week. Did my first lunch meeting yesterday and booked 3-4 in next 2 weeks . 
Any other statigy would you guys recommend to get patients.
 Little disappointed

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My goal when I started was to talk to 5 new people every day.  I would attend networking groups, meet other PTs or OTs that do home health, gym owners.   
Set up free info talks at libraries, gyms (wherever you feel like your audience is located).  
Attend and participate in local health fairs and talk to the everyone.  
You are on the right track so far if you already have 3-4.  Keep it going!

> **Response 2:** I think I have had a handful of patients from meetings with doctors in the past 5 years. The majority of my referrals came from word of mouth from other patients. I had many referrals from home care PTs who had to DC people that still needed care but couldn’t get to a clinic. Try reaching out to any friends who are Homecare therapists. I also talked to all of my friends and family about my business in the beginning and they referred people to me. Also it’s not always a popular option but my caseload doubled once I accepted Medicare.

Thought I'd share a win. 
Client that I've been seeing for a few months. Started off as Mc client. Went to self pay bc not medically necessary according to those standards. Had a stroke 6 months ago. 
Is now playing tennis 6 days a week. 
Clay courts  and opened up to full court recently with his trainer who didn't think he'd be able to ever do that again. 
Footwork is improving weekly. 
Working on timing of ue and le movements for the game. 
He's a very good athlete with underlying compensations as all of us have and it made me smile to know we're reaching goals that he and I have and had. 
A challenging case but that's why we do this right????

**Original Post:**
I'm treating a husband and wife at their home.  I have a mobile/cash PT practice.  The husband has psoriatic arthritis, is a fall risk, has some mental illness and PTSD.  At evaluation, he was upfront about his alcohol and cocaine use.  He says he's allergic to narcotics and breaks out in a rash so he is managing his pain the only way he knows how.  

He has no showed 3 times now because he was too ill to do his session.  Today, his wife went to get him for his appointment and she came back saying he wanted to cancel today and he was using cocaine in his bedroom.  

Husband and wife live pretty separate lives and may become legally separated soon.  I want to help, but I left today feeling a little uneasy.  I'm worried that he's unstable and unpredictable and could be impaired during our sessions and I want to make sure I'm safe.

I've never come across this situation before, and I'm not one to give up on people.  Any advice for me?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would say PT probably is not his most urgent need. I would advise another service to treat his mental health and addiction first and return to PT if he is able to adhere to some treatment. For me it does not sound like you will achieve much with PT alone at this stage. Perhaps he needs a multidisciplinary organization.

> **Response 2:** I’d say cut your losses. It sounds like he values his time significantly more than yours. I can almost guarantee nothing will change and most likely get worse.

What brace is everybody’s favorite for offloading OA in the knee

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If it’s unilateral then I like to use a heel wedge. For example if they have medial pain, then I’ll try a lateral heel wedge to apply a gaping force to the medial side.  It’s been very effective, but if not, the patient is only out six or eight dollars. ￼￼

> **Response 2:** If you get incrediwear it is a wearable anti inflammatory sleeve that has I think it’s germanium in it that some how helps with the OA pain from reducing inflammation not sure about the research behind it but I’ve seen it as a part of my companies many partnerships!

Want to give a big shout out/huge thanks to David Bayliff & Kevin DeGroot for helping me hit a milestone I wasn’t sure I’d ever see - my business is DEBT FREE!  

I participated in Traction Week back in April, and did some major refocusing and restructuring using what I learned. While I had made some progress since the beginning of 2025, I still had a hefty balance thanks to some unexpected but unavoidable large expenses.

I’m not a traditional uncaged business (wellness focused but I work with animals as well as people, and I’m hybrid mobile/office), but I have learned so much from the amazing free resources here - the podcasts, the blogs, Traction Week, etc - and I would not have made it here without this group. So THANK YOU!! Now to work on a new business plan so that i can grow beyond “solopreneur” status 🥳🎊

Okay the marketing for StemWave is blasting me haha has anyone used it? They have some seriously strong claims. I am just looking at different investments for the future since non PT staff can operate it. But it’s got a huge price tag!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go with Curamedix/storz. I had a stemwave and gave it back within the trial period. They have no data supporting their device, they’ve made their own protocols where “less seems to work better” but really it’s bc the cost of the electrode consumable is so high.  

ALSO…I found out they are selling the device to just about anyone including non professionals like “muscular activation specialists”. I think on that principle alone we’re diluting the value of our services and shouldn’t support a company like that.

> **Response 2:** Ginger Morrissey can speak to stem wave and a competitor (SoftWave) since she tried both

For those who have used the Nubis for awhile, how has it held so far? How is customer service? Is it comfortable? I am looking for a table I can carry as a backpack and easily take it upstairs. I don't want to invest in something that breaks easily and cannot readily repair. Thanks! 

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am going on 2 years with using my @nubis-physio  Works great for my patient population and a mobile PT Biz.  DM for any questions.  I purchased direct from @nubis-physio in Slovenia.  Took a couple of weeks to arrive put completely satisfied with product.  Yes pump is noisy for 20-30 sec to inflate/deflate, put to be honest, clients are impressed with the table!  I start exercises and discussion while setting up.  Portability is unparalleled.  In full transparency, after 5-6 clients in one day, I am done setting it up as a mobile therapist!  I purchased prone face pillow, kneeling pad, and inflatable bolster as accessories.  I use them all.  Highly recommend!  As far as the price differential compared to a traditional folding table...in my opinion totally worth it.  8-10 patients pays for it depending on your price per visit.  Can be rolled like a suitcase of carried like a backpack.  You choose.  Recently in Texas during icey conditions, I "backpacked" it instead of rolling.  Hope this helps answer some questions out there!

> **Response 2:** I inquired over 2 years ago. Still haven't pulled the trigger but keep questioning it myself, too. My brief email exchange with the vendor wasn't all too productive. They're agreeable to sharing product specs and whatnot but won't commit anything verbally to describe or back their longevity. My concern with portable tables has always been the value of the purchase. The wear on typical massage folding tables is probably ballpark 5 or so years, so I'd be getting value of about $30/year roughly - a heckuva lot more affordable. So it comes down to how much I might value the actual premium features of the Nubis.
The warranty btw is only 2 years.

For those of you who started your business while working for another company in some capacity , how do you get around the conflict of interest statement usually found in the companies handbook? 

*** I did not sign a non compete , this clause is in the handbook ***

I currently still work part time 20 hours at an outpatient facility and have a side business that I’m building but I’m hesitant to go hard core with my marketing due to the conflict of interest statement in our handbook which states : 

“@@ employees must not do anything where their personal interests could conflict or reasonably appear to conflict with the interests at ( this company ) . 
For example, it you were to participate in any business opportunity where you might receive personal financial gain apart from your normal wages, you could be in a conflict of interest situation. 

Personal Financial Gain

You should not take any money separate from your normal wages that could affect your decision making
abilities as a @@ emplovee such as:

You or a family member taking money from a company that does business with this company. 

You or a close family member having ownership in a business that competes with this company 

Outside Activities
You should avoid outside work or actions that could could have a bad effect on ( this companies ) reputation in the community
or could conflict with vour duty to (this company)” 

I’m probably going to make an appointment with an employment layer. But I’m curious because I have not heard anyone address this issue when starting up a business . Most people I have listened too actually encourage you work part time or at least PRN while building. 

** also side note PRN with this company is a W2 so handbook rules still apply **

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I spoke to my direct supervisor when getting started. My business is mobile and online which is not something my job offered. 

To avoid conflict of interest, I didn’t speak about my business at work. When I ended up leaving the job and patients asked where I was going, I said I was changing jobs/settings. Some found me online and started working with me on their own. I never told them to

> **Response 2:** As long as you aren’t directly marketing to patients at your current job or “stealing” employees at your current job i don’t see a conflict or problem

What is your favorite tactic for increasing prices? some are on a package and others are pay per visit and others are continued per visit at the package price discounted rate for a coke more follow ups - what do you tell them? My brains too tired to find the right words. 

Aug 1 is my goal and I’m trying to figure out what’s “fair” time wise to get info out.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I recommend personally telling your current clients face to face. Offer them the opportunity to purchase more sessions at their current rate, or give them a heads up on when you’ll be raising the price. Treat them like VIP. Then send an email to your list - give them a chance to buy at ur old rate (if ur looking for a cash injection) and then start charging to new patients (who will be the first to pay the new price).

You don’t have to tell them why. In fact don’t justify. Just say you have a price increase. They don’t need to know the details.

> **Response 2:** Raise prices on new clients only..

Start AUG 1....     

And tell current clients prices are going up, yet you value them so much and as a thank you you will keep them on the original price 

WIN - WIN

Good luck

Hi everyone! What are your thoughts on this?

I literally just started my "side hustle" cash-based business (I have two clients right now) as I'm still employed with my F/T job. I don't want to leave my F/T job for personal reasons. My only available hours to see potential patients would be from 5:30-8PM. I offer PT, personal training and recovery services.

A nearby gym has offered me to use their space and market my business to their members. They are allowing me to have full access to their 1000 sq ft gym with office/private room/equipment availability. The rent would depend on how many people I attract but the low end would be $1000/month (not sure what that means -- why can't it be a fixed amount?). If I only saw 2-3 patients/week, they said it wouldn't be worth it. I think I can cover the lower end of the monthly rent with one person's 10-session package BUT I'm worried about "will I have time for myself?", "will seeing 10 patients/week be too overwhelming?", "what if I can't even get people to buy in my services and now I have to cough up my own money to pay the rent" if I end up going this route. I eventually declined the offer for the moment but felt this might be a great opportunity.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** $1000/month for a 1000 Sq ft gym seems excessive. See if they are willing to give you a per hour rate. I pay $25/hour where I do side stuff. Normally only a few patients per week.
A per month rate that high would only make sense if you are there full time.

> **Response 2:** At first glance that sounds too high of rent for so a side hustle. If they really wanted you, I would try to negotiate a percentage of your billed amount.

Hey everyone! I have a lymphedema practice and am 100% cash-based.  I have a patient wanting to start with me but she is Medicare/Humana and I am not in with Medicare. I told her that she will need to go to a clinic that bills Medicare, but she is desperate because she has to pay $150 for medical transport. There are really not any mobile CLTs in my area but me. I just want to make sure there is no way around Medicare. I feel bad not helping her, but I don't want to mess with Medicare. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Contract with a home health company who is INN and treat her. She'll either have to pay $150 for transport to a clinic where they take insurance or pay you out of pocket so maybe it's a wash?

> **Response 2:** I think you technically could have her sign an ABN saying she refuses to have her information sent to Medicare and you would have to comply.  I think if you don't do this often it would work, but not 100%, maybe something you can look into further.

Hey everyone,  I’m back looking for some help to clear stuff up again.  

I’ve finally got a consistent referral source and am getting Medicare referrals.  However I’m running into a lot of issues when I call to check benefits of:

A. Not even being able to get through to someone on the provider line because I’m not “in network” with them to ask about the patients benefits 
Or 
B. Getting told the patient doesn’t have out of network benefits and I can’t see them

From my own experience I know that sometimes you get told things by representatives that aren’t correct.  But I’m running into a lot of confusion on my end because of all of these individual plans inside of the Medicare replacements.  Like I’ve had referrals from patients this week and all of them had different UHC Medicare plans (one dual; one AARP and one UHC Medicare group or something like that) 

I’m resigned to the fact that this is a learn as I go along process, but I’m just wondering if there’s a way to navigate and understand this better or if anyone has any tips because I’m worried that im going to end up providing services I can’t get paid for or ending up turning down patients I can see.  

So, anyone out there have a cheat sheet? lol

What do you think about this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a former LMT of 15 years before I become an OT I do have some concerns. 

1. My biggest concern is that stretching recommendations changed in 2015 and not a lot of massage therapists or other therapists are very well informed about it. Stretching too much can actually increase risk of injury. Massage therapists, personal trainers etc are not trained nor can prescribe stretching protocols. 
2. It has morphed into something much more than stretching. 
3. We should absolutely be lobbying some of these stretch labs especially ones that use resistance bands like the example provided in the link:

https://www.instagram.com/reel/CiAhDFEDpva/?igsh=MXJwZW45bjQ4eThwag==

> **Response 2:** Stretch Lab is a national franchise that hires PTAs, trainers and h to e like to do manual stretch sessions on people. Whole body 30-60 minutes basically for people who don’t want to do the work at home. I know PTAs who have switched bc no insurance, documentation or exercise prescription. Like the massage therapists of stretching. They stretch you and you go. Come again and see someone else whatever. 
PT does a terrible job of defining and protecting our scope

PLEASE POKE HOLES IN THIS

I made a 2-page intro document for RPE and "zones" training. I want it to be something I can post on my website or send directly to potential clients. It needs to be accurate of course, but also simple and approachable with no pressing questions afterward.

HELP. I have a tricky situation to navigate. There is a new functional medicine/wellness center that really wants to partner with us to be able to offer cash PT. We like them a lot as people and like their mission, but idk if they really know how a business works. They want to charge a monthly rent that is a little above market value for the space (linens, EMR, front desk, basic equipment, and some other minor things are included in that) but then take 20%%%%%% of our profit. 

I've never been in a sublease situation before, but I don't know what business takes that much of a cut if they aren't providing that much extra service or referrals to the leasee. They also have no idea how many referrals they could give and I assume I will need to do most of the hustle for marketing. 

Feel free to comment or ask questions!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No percentage usually. Rent only

> **Response 2:** I will be a little more blunt, as Kelley Ryan said...NO!  rent higher than market plus 20% rake on profit?? that's a nicely disguised kick back...and you would be partially caged in my opinion.  

 Your niche' is womens health and that specialty is so in demand.  If you are good at what you do, and I'm sure you are, you will be more than fine.  rent out a room in an office and spend your time on marketing ob/gyn's,  primary care MD's, physiatrists, new mom's groups etc.  word of mouth will spread like wildfire.  you will crush it.

Hello! I got my LLC and liability insurance!! Whoo hoo! 
I am a mobile PT So what would be my next immediate step to be able to see patients? Do I need my NPI? Or can I just start! 

How do you handle the payment if you don’t have a system in place yet? 

What forms are must haves? (I took the Bootcamp so there are forms somewhere correct?) 
Do I have to have an Rx from a doctor if I see PTs in MO? 
Sorry for all the questions! Just excited and nervous!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congrats! 

Get your NPI and get an EIN (tax number). I take cash and checks currently, I’m too small to pay credit card fees right now. Need consent and intake forms. Consent form you need a HIPAA or privacy policy part, consent to treatment part, financial agreement part as basic info. I think those are the most important. Highly highly advise you read your state practice act, I’m in Texas so I can’t help you there! Technically you can see people as long as you have your license up to date as well! Figure out if you want an EMR and/or how you’re going to document, get a business checking/savings and credit card set up for the LLC. Read up on Medicare participating or non participating enrollments on the page here to see if you want to go through that process as well.

Hey crew! thoughts on reaching out to patients who are once a week or once every other week…I’m mobile cash based PT. Do you reach out to check in and see how patients are doing after a session or just wait til next session? Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Personally I view it as a must.  It’s an additional thing that separates you from the insurance based clinic around the corner, shows that you actually care about their rehab journey and don’t view them just as another name, and is helpful regarding exercise changes/modifications that most PTs don’t get to make until the following week.

> **Response 2:** I am not cash base but if I were i think that level a follow up would be a great idea. I am working on a telehealth job which I have yet to start but I do know they have some kind of text message system as well. There is some question on hippa compliance so I would make sure they have signed a release stating they are aware that text messaging is not secure. Were there may be a different app system you could use that is considered secure. Something to think about.

**Original Post:**
Hi friends. I’m wondering if anyone has an infographic or something comparing chiropractic education (particularly in musculoskeletal and orthopedics) vs DPT education.  I want to create a community educational post saying something along the lines of “PTs are at least as qualified as chiros to treat musculoskeletal issues, so try coming to us first”, but I don’t want to create beef with local chiros. 

I’m just really tired of every single suggestion to every single community group post about anything body related being “go to the chiropractor!”  I do comment that there are other options, but I’d like to create an actual image or content post. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Make the comparison about the patient, not the practitioners..

What are the patients’ common pain points with chiros?

-The endless cycle of adjustment when that’s all they do: “I feel great after I got adjusted but a couple days later the pain always returns and I’m right where I started” 

-Signing up for some six month plan of 2-3x 
per week for $3,000

-Fear mongering by X-ray..”They took an X-ray of my back and told me how this little curve in my spine is causing me pain and if I don’t act now and sign up for six months my spine will continue to deteriorate.” 

If you can speak to these pain points and offer solutions (like how you can offer long term solutions that don’t involve signing your life away for six months; and how you help the patient build self care skills; and you’re not gonna take an X-ray just to tell people how crippled they are). I think that’s a better way to go. 

And you’re not even naming a profession by name; you’re just speaking to the frustrations that many people experience with the way certain practitioners work and saying you have an alternative and more enduring way that improves upon their pain points. 

Also, comparing “physical therapy” by name with chiro might fail too because lots of people have the experience of “I went to PT and they just gave me a sheet of core exercises that I could look up online and did nothing for my pain, but when I went to the chiropractor I felt amazing when I got off the table” 

Also, if we play the education comparison game, MD’s have us all beat, even though their expertise is mainly in MSK pathology and invasive procedures, but in MSK function we’re the subject matter experts

> **Response 2:** I dont believe this is true about you but it sounds too "inferiority complex-y" to me. I 100% agree and even believe a highly trained PT is better but I wouldn't compare. Just talk about what you can do, what you treat etc...

PSA. This text message was a follow-up to a phone conversation. I had with an owner of a fairly large home health agency in Chicago. She explained she just got out of some big meeting where they discussed. The home health payment cuts for 2024. If there was ever a time to break away. If there was ever a time to start your own gig. The time is now. The best time was yesterday and the next best time is now.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Fill us in when she texts you the numbers.

> **Response 2:** I don't think the proposed rule for home health has been released yet, so I will be curious to see what number she gives you.  Over the past few years they've actually received increases, small amounts but still an increase.

I love what I get to do for work but this year so far has been stressful. 

I started this program 8 weeks ago because I hadn’t done a great job taking care of myself even though that’s what I talk to our clients about all the time. 

Today feels like a good day to have this test as the culmination of that program and a day where I’m so grateful for the incredible people around me who challenge me and encourage me to take care of myself

Just starting my cash based business. I gave a patient my superbill with my EIN. She submitted to UHC and they're requesting a TIN not an EIN. I'm an individual owner LLC so I thought I just used my SSN on my taxes. I don't have a TIN, and I don't really want to put my SSN on my superbills. Any recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m thinking the insurance company is mistaken, if you have an EIN. All claims for my business for 5 years have only ever used the business EIN, as we had applied for that.

> **Response 2:** As I understand it, there are several kinds of TINs (Tax ID Number), including your SSN (social security number) and EIN. Therefore, your EIN *is* your TIN.

Looking for recommendations/ thoughts on what to charge when your staff PT needs PT from another clinician in your practice. We are a brick and mortar clinic and our rates are $250 for evaluation and $150-175 for 1 hour treatments. I know we all help each other few minutes here and there without charging- but this case needs a full hour consult and I want to put a policy around it. Appreciate any direction/ advice on this. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You charge nothing because that’s the right thing to do. Employee benefit

> **Response 2:** I’d say let that be a private arrangement between the two interested parties. I wouldn’t try to profit off of anything as a courtesy.

I will be trying out a shockwave device for a month. No cost . I am 90% sold on buying it (as long as it works the way it is supposed to). I have a few patients I know I want to try it on. I am alsconsidering advertising the device starting 1 week before I get the trial one because that will also give me an idea of interest of community. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have had Softwave since December and our patients are experiencing amazing results! It’s been a great addition to our clinic. Only regret is that we didn’t get it sooner!

To start we  had a day and set aside about 4 hours and scheduled patients to come in for a visit at a lower cost and from there they can decide to sign up or not. It helped get the word out without pushing it to patients and to grow awareness. This worked great for us.

> **Response 2:** I have Stemwave and it has made such a difference in my clinic.  What I did was just out it in every person that came in with no additional fee just to see how they responded.  They responded so well I kept it.

Hello everyone! 

I have a quick question. One of my patients approach me and asked me to provide private PT @ home in NYC after he run out of his Medicare B service.
 
What’s the legal and ethical way or procedure to start cash base (private pay)physical therapy services at home for Medicare B patients in NY after they already reach their market cap and wanted PT via private pay (out of pocket) . 

Can anyone clear my following doubts ..

1. Can I legally work with Med B as cash pay(out of pocket)..?

2. I have to get ABN form signed before I start as private pay for med B home care patient  ..!? Right

3. Or I have to sign any other wellness waiver form instead of ABN?

4. If work as private pay do I have to do documentation for PT treatment..?

Any information would be greatly appreciated along with format or any attachment for any form. 

Any suggestions on this would be greatly appreciated , as I am new to this private pay/cased base practice .

Thanks in advance .🙏🏻

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Firstly there is no cap. Medicare covers medically necessary skilled therapy services.  You can charge cash for services that are not covered by Medicare or do not meet the above criteria. If it is something that Medicare would normally cover but would not be covered in this case you would complete an ABN with the client prior to beginning services. For services Medicare would not normally cover e.g. dry needling or fitness program you would use your usual waiver. If it is skilled therapy that meets that criteria then it must be billed to Medicare. Therapists are not allowed to opt out and there is a mandatory claims submission requirement.

Are there any private pay only therapists in this group from Michigan? I am getting conflicting information regarding who I can and cannot see as private pay regarding Medicaid and Medicare clients. I would love to reach out to get some clarification. Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wonder if it would make a difference if enough Medicare recipients spoke out about having their access to care restricted. Does anyone know the rationale behind allowing medical providers to opt out vs. allied health?

> **Response 2:** As far as Medicare, it doesn’t matter what state you’re in because it’s a federal program. If you’re seeing older adults 65 and above and you’re providing skilled and medically necessary services, OT and PT cannot ￼opt out of Medicare. ￼ If you’re providing wellness or preventative type services, you can do cash.

Question:
Literally ALL of my elderly patients thought they had Medicare as their primary insurance and then also a secondary. Come to find out, they all have medicare advantage/ "medicare replacement" cards that are actually their primary insurance.
My question is, if someone's primary insurance is medicare advantage (through United Healthcare, Security Health Plan, Anthem), can they pay cash since I can't even bill Medicare for PT services?
Anyone have experience with these Medicare Advantage Plans?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting question.especially since their Medicare is being managed by these advantage plans.

> **Response 2:** I'm in with Medicare and OON with all commercial insurances. I end up taking a lot of advantage plans OON, as the insurance has to pay Medicare rates. It just depends on the individual plan whether I will take them or not.

Looking for some feedback on this situation: I've been subletting from a private gym for a while now and it's been great-- until another PT owner tried to plant themselves in the space too. The gym put them off for a few months, but now they are going back on their word to me and told the other business they could see a client there. Is this a "tough ish, that's business" situation? Is this the market now? While I understand it's not personal, it's business...I guess I had more faith in professionals respecting each other's spaces. Tell me I'm wrong and I will get over it 🤣

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I signed a lease and the lease has exclusivity rights to avoid competition. Not sure if theres a way you could talk to them and see if you could get something like that? But end of the day, it unfortunately is business. I would either leave or just make sure you have clear marketing and start establishing who your clear ideal client is.

> **Response 2:** My business mentor had a similar issue and ended up leaving due to the personal relationship falling apart. 

I’ve worked out of 2 gyms and each time the expectation was that I was the “exclusive” physical therapist at the space. I give preference to clients at the space with either financial discounts or priority scheduling. 
If you have already been doing that and this still happened, my recommendation is to see if the relationship really benefits you or if you’re just using the space. 

Do they refer to you regularly? Are they using your presence at the gym to market and generate revenue? Are you regularly working with the personal trainers in the space to ensure their clientele doesn’t fall off due to injury? 

If the space is benefiting more than you, I’d consider leaving. If not and it’s fairly even, try having a more direct conversation about the logistics of your business relationship and get things in writing. 

Good luck 👍🏻

**Practice for Sale**

**Clinic Location: West Florida (Tampa-Sarasota Area)**

**Clinic Summary:**

Husband and Wife Owned/Lead PTs

80- 90% caseload booked-consistently for the last 2 years 

Brick and Mortar Hybrid Practice Medicare+Cash ($200 per session) 

Great local relationships for exclusive referrals 

**Why I'm Selling:**
Due to family relocation to our dream state/life (more of a mountain people vs beach lol) and being closer to relatives as we grow our family, I’m seeking to pass the baton to someone who can take this clinic to the next level. Our move-out date will be mid-2026, so I’m being proactive in finding the right person to ensure a smooth transition. I’d love to be involved during the handover to ensure everything stays seamless for my clients and referral partners.

While I have no expectations of a high price, I’m looking for someone who appreciates the value of this fully functioning business and can continue to build upon the solid foundation already in place.

This clinic has consistently profited, is well-loved by the community (>110 5-star google reviews), and has the potential for even greater success with the right clinician or owner.

Comment below interested and i’ll send you a message for a quick chat and more info about our profitability and KPIs

Does anybody use a mifi or portable Wi-Fi for computer work when not able to connect to other Wi-Fi’s?

Any recommendations or devices or data plan carriers?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a wireless plan for my ipad.
I have t-mobile. I've been very happy with it but it's also very different in different areas as far as coverage.

You have to make sure you have an iPad that is cellular capable. Otherwise a mifi device will work. Each carrier has them

I did not find using my phone as a  hotspot to be very reliable the other thing is when you use your phone as a  hotspot at some point it slows your speed. So if you normally get 4G or 5G or hotspot is often 1G less it depends on your carrier and plan. Plus it uses your battery a lot faster

I also found that when I would walk with my patients outside and I had my phone with me it would disconnect from the hotspot and I had to redo it and it was super annoying and I didn't want to have to think about it.
Documentation is hard enough getting it done while you're with the patient so I didn't want anything to make it harder.

> **Response 2:** I just checked into this myself last week. I have an iPad I intend to use for my documentation, but it is a Wi-Fi only device. I checked with my carrier and can add unlimited hotspot to my personal cell plan for $20 per month. This is probably the route I’m going to take. ￼

**Community Responses:**

They present complex material in a way that’s easy to understand and immediately applicable. I find myself learning new skills over the weekend and confidently applying them in clinic on Monday. I highly recommend AAMT to any clinician looking to elevate their practice!  Feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions. I’d be happy to help.

Ever have a former patient reach out for services again… but you’re not comfortable treating them?

I’m in a situation where I could use some guidance.
A patient I treated years ago in a clinic found my mobile practice after calling the old clinic, and I treated him privately about two years ago. Clinically, it was fine — he improved, and we discharged when skilled PT was no longer needed.

However, during those visits he would occasionally make comments that made me uncomfortable. Nothing overt, but enough that I remember feeling uneasy. He’s very blunt and tends to laugh things off, and at the time I let it slide and continued with care.

Fast forward two years — he recently contacted me again for PT. On the intake call he mentioned going to a large corporate clinic and compared their approach (“they had me lifting way heavier weights than you did”), so I clarified *why* I had chosen lighter loads at the time due to his deconditioning. He seemed to understand, but something about restarting care with him doesn’t feel right to me.

I’m struggling with how to professionally and ethically decline without worrying he might change or remove the positive review he left in the past.
Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it while maintaining boundaries and professionalism?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not taking new clients at the time. I appreciate your interest.

> **Response 2:** Trust your gut. Tell him you have a waiting list and he should contact  “PT at ……”. That you have put in a good word so they will take excellent care of him

EDIT: I can’t tag any of the team so hopefully they will see this 🤞🏻

I just want to give a shoutout to the Uncaged team - after catching the April 1 live podcast, I have started listening to other episodes of the pod during my runs (marathon & dopey challenge training… so.much.running) and all I can say is WOW. 

If you haven’t listened to any of their pod, you are missing out on some incredible insights. I haven’t gone in any particular order so far, I’ve picked episodes that the title/description speaks to something I’m struggling with, curious about, etc so don’t feel like you have to start all the way back at the beginning. 

Every single episode, I’ve had at least a handful of times where I find myself saying (out loud because I talk to myself when I’m running alone ha!) “yup, that’s me” or “yup I totally do that” or “huh, never thought of it that way” or “wow I need to try that.” I should probably listen when I am in a position to take notes, because there’s so many little gold nuggets of knowledge I want to remember! I’m not practicing OT at this point in my business, but there is SO much that is applicable to anyone who works for themselves or wants to do so eventually. 

So, long story short - huge shout out to the UC team especially on the podcast. You all are so generous with your wealth of knowledge, please know that it is appreciated so much!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Kate Myers Baccus wow thank you! 🙏. Thank you so much for your kind words, you have no idea how appreciated they are. Our team works hard at putting out great content, and a post like this makes it all worth it. Thank you for taking the time to share, we appreciate you! Hope we continue to encourage you, motivate you, and inspire you on your long runs 👊

I’m at the VERY beginning of thinking about becoming uncaged. I’ve posted before: I have 1 yo twins and a 4 yo. Husband has a stable job and decent insurance I could get on. My question: how do you ladies or people capable of carrying children or men who want paternity leave deal with a new baby? I’ve been able to work up to a week before kiddo is here, but I really enjoy having 3 months off afterward (mostly to get them to start sleeping a LITTLE). 
Edited to add: not currently pregnant but we want more after we recover from the twins. 

How do you handle parental leave if you’re on your own (financially, but also what do you do with your caseload?)??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I found out I was pregnant shortly after I started my business but I was able to save enough for a 4 month maternity leave within that timeframe. I did not have anyone to see my patients when I was off so I discharged or put them on hold and all patients were incredibly understanding and supportive. That being said, I supplemented my income by working PRN at a hospital 4-6 days a month. With my business I went from 1-2 patients per week (for the first 4 months) to 6-7 per week until I gave birth. 

It can be done. Plant lots of seeds and they will grow. If you need to find a supplement like PRN, I recommend it because it still helps carry us financially when caseload is slow and now we have 2 kids in daycare.

> **Response 2:** Started planning for it pretty much as soon as I knew I was pregnant and wanted to take ￼time off. Made sure to communicate very early on with patients so they weren’t surprised- was able to discharge some, refer to other therapists if referrals came closer to due date, ￼ and started saving as well. I was able to take about a month off before baby was born, and about two months afterwards. ￼So I’d say early communication and planning make it doable!

Hi everyone - asking a bit of broad question, but I definitely need input. I've been approached to provide PT services for a local home hospice company as an Independent Contractor, and I am interested. They've asked me to send them my rates - including for evaluations, follow-ups, and mileage. I've been a PT (DPT) for 11 years, 6 of which I spent working for a home health and hospice company. I also own an LLC providing mobile/concierge pelvic health privately, so the only comparison I have so far is what I charge for that, which is $145 for 90-minute evaluations and $95 for 60-minute follow ups. The home health co I PRN for pays $110 for a SOC (which I wouldn't do in this hospice setting), $70 for evals, and $60 for follow ups, and I live in South Mississippi. Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would tell them your rates are higher and then begin negotiations. Will you be a 1099 or are you billing them ?

> **Response 2:** I don’t think that your rates are outrageous. Further, I don’t think that they are out of the ballpark.
It would seem that the worst thing that could happen is they would want to negotiate. 

“Here are my rates for the clients I’m serving in this area presently:”

If you were going to offer them any sort of discount (if they ask) you might consider it just because you wouldn’t have to necessarily work as hard for the referrals? I don’t think it’s necessary, though.

Did you think the Hertel and Brown case was a fluke or a "one off"? Guess again!

Owner of Oahu Physical Therapy Clinic Sentenced to 9 Months in Federal Prison for Health Care Fraud.

Timothy Wells admitted that from July 2013 through early 2020, he submitted false claims for payment for physical therapy services to TRICARE and Medicare. Wells used individuals not trained in physical therapy, including massage therapists, athletic trainers, personal trainers, and an individual who had no professional licenses or certifications whatsoever, to provide physical therapy services to patients. Wells admitted that he knew these individuals were not authorized providers and that he could not legitimately bill TRICARE and Medicare for physical therapy services rendered by them, even under supervision. Nevertheless, Wells billed the programs as though the services had been provided by licensed practitioners.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just don’t understand all the hard work and effort it takes to become a therapist and people choose greed over integrity it’s just crazy 💀

> **Response 2:** If you commit blatant fraud, you deserve to get caught. Hopefully, that does not fall under their professional liability claims, or we all end up paying for the bad guys. To be fair, from what I read about Hertel and Brown, there was some pretty shady things going down on a personal level with the owners as well. When you use unlicensed people to perform physical therapy--we all know this is fraud. If you are looking to make $$$ in the profession, do us a favor and leave rather than mar the profession.

Mobile side hustlers…

Is becoming “in network” with Medicare a game changer? A PT was telling me that he still makes over $115+ on each 60 min session and that he stays booked d/t the population wanting to use those benefits. 

If so, what’s the easiest way to make this possible? Any resources? TIA!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It is possible to make that much or more being in network with Medicare per session. So you just need to determine if that is worth it to you, and also if all the logistics and red tape is worth it to you

This seems so basic, but how do you actually drop off marketing materials to referring clinicians/mds?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Something off beat or off the wall like a shock and awe package.
Having written a book on your expertise works well, because it takes up physical space on their desk or shelf, but stays subconsciously in the mind. 
Mail a package of peanuts directly to the doctor with a flyer saying “You’d be nuts not to work with us”
A rubber foot saying “I’ve done the hard work for you and got my foot in the door…now here’s how we can work with each other to benefit our patients”
If you have a local podcast, getting them on as a guest then opening the 2 way street is a good one.

> **Response 2:** Here's my process (I'll probably get a million comments saying I'm doing it wrong but....). When I go in, I only bring one form of marketing materials, letter, brochure, card, so I have excuses to come back and drop off more. When I go in, I ask the front desk person their name and if I can drop off materials for the doctor (s). Always respect their level of busy-ness. If they have time for small chitter-chatter while I get out the materials, then that's fine. As soon as I leave the office, I write down the name of the front desk person and any little details they said (going on vacation soon, only work in the mornings, etc). I then put in my calendar when I'll be coming back to drop off more info. On the return visit, I say hello to the front desk person by name and say something about our last conversation (how was your vacation? I came in the morning because I knew you'd be here....) While dropping off different marketing materials from the last time, I try to get some Intel from the front desk (would I be able to schedule a meeting with the doc? How does your office handle PT referrals? Etc). It's a snowball process of getting the trust of the front desk, the gatekeepers. So you can get in to see the MDs face to face.

Good Morning Guys,
I was wondering how effective is it to pay some one $1400 for marketing each month including SEO, Bloggong and Google Ads too? Also there is $2000 initiate up fees and 12 months contract…. I am a small practice and looking forward to bring my side hassle to a full time work… is it worth? Or should I hire someone to do my SEO? Want to hear what others have done and are doing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Better question is can you handle it. I’d be shooting myself in the foot. My people are nearly maxed out and I’m thankful I got a new hire Tuesday starting in January. It would be too much

> **Response 2:** I hesitate to agree with contracts that long, I would ask how they are going to demonstrate success and what happens after the 6 month mark if there is no difference in your bottom line.  I went thru something like this about a year ago, and would honestly not repeat it.  I would rather spend the time to learn it and then do it vs pay someone who, fingers crossed, is actually going to do their job

I’m considering paying more for Nextiva. Does anyone know if it works better than the others?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you have Google voice for personal use or Google voice for business? One is free and the other is like 11/mo

> **Response 2:** Make sure your incoming and outgoing calls are set on “voice network “

During the past three days I was blessed to host a small group of the UNCAGED CLINICIAN Mastermind students. 

A HUGE THANK YOU to my wife, Cara Bayliff, who took care of outings and meal prepping, and to Hannah Legare (DeGroot) who planned and led the retreat!! 🙏🙌

While they were here to learn from Hannah, UNCAGED’s personal development coach, and me, we were inspired by them. 

That is certainly a trait of a successful practice owner - their ability to inspire others. 

It’s amazing to know that I have the honor of helping these, and many other business owners like them, to discover and to develop their personal legends.

In doing so, they not only create massive impacts in their communities, but they also generate the abilities to authentically live in their personal “Why’s”. 

As I listened to each one’s reflection last night, each was ready and eager to move the needle two steps forward.

The cool thing is that it wasn’t a “new tactic” that excited them.

Rather, it was their respective personal introspection that showed them their next steps. 

For that, I could not be more excited or proud for each one of them.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Can’t thank you all enough for an incredible weekend! I loved my first small group retreat and left feeling energized and motivated to make my dreams come true for my business and my family! Love you all!

Just for fun...let's talk about some of our favorite books written by PTs!  We know there are so many books out there written about exercise and various  medical conditions, so it's really nice to see more physical therapists getting into the book writing space! 

I would love to learn more about what's out there so we can support our fellow therapists... plus it gives me something else to read to keep me off my phone!🤪

In the meantime a few I've enjoyed:

-Floored - Sara Reardon
-The Science of Stretch - Leada Malek
-The Bathroom Key - Kathryn Kassai (a bit older but was very well written)

- I'm also in the process of reading Becoming a Supple Leopard... I didn't realize he was a PT also until I started reading it.

Please add what you've enjoyed!!

I am finding that using AI to help with my documentation is leading to wordy and lengthy documentation. I’m using ChatGPT not something integrated with my EMR. Please tell me there is a difference and it saves time versus making me write novels.

I loathe documentation.
This has been a theme throughout my childhood ….I have always loathed assignments and homework my whole life.  Documentation feels like an extension of this. I treat one on one so I'm always left with documentation at the end of the day. (I know one on one is a gift lol)

I have been using ChatGPT to do as much of the heavy lifting as possible, by making it write patient assessments for me with this GPT

https://[chat.openai.com/g/g-C1fuXSdT4-ai-assessment-](http://chat.openai.com/g/g-C1fuXSdT4-ai-assessment-)writer-pt

hopefully it helps some of you!
Generally curious why our notes are so
monotonous and repetitive but none of us
implement any tools to get them done?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This why I use Comprehend Health to help writes my notes for me in real time as I treat. Every section of my note is completed in real time so I can focus on treating each client 100% of the time. I just check it over at the end to make sure I verbalized everything needed for my note, hit finalize, and my note is complete in seconds. I treat one-on-one as well, so it’s great knowing that as my last patient leaves I am actually done for the day, evals, daily notes, and progress notes are all done in real time. 

Chat GPT is great, but it isn’t HIPAA compliant, so you can’t use it with any real patient info. Having to jump back and forth with chatGPT and manually writing in information so it can then spit something back out, which you have to edit multiple times then copy into your EMR is even more time consuming.

> **Response 2:** Can someone give me a concrete example of how exactly you use ChatGPT or any AI to assist with documentation, assessments, SOAP notes, etc?  I understand that I can type in the search box something like “give me examples of blog posts for a physical therapy clinic” but how do you literally do it for documentation? I just can’t wrap my head around this. I am VERY new to trying to use these platforms too. TIA!

Hey Vestibular PTs! How often do you perform on Epley on a pt with posterior canal BPPV? I’m asking for myself- had my first episode with it and am treating myself. Not something I generally treat, so any advice is appreciated. The first time did correct the nystagmus and I repeated it twice that day. But I am still lightheaded and slightly dizzy the next day. Thank you!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go check out my TikTok page on this topic @thedizzypt_amy.  I have a playlist on BPPV.  It's made for patients but will tell you a lot and answer a bunch of questions

> **Response 2:** I’ve had success with 3-4 repetitions of the Epley at a time in one or two treatment sessions, a few days to a week apart. Try to avoid laying flat or looking up/down or bending over for 24 hrs after the treatment.

What I learned about business from hiking Angels Landing with my fam. I’m terrified of heights, and they say if you’re scared of heights, this hike ain’t for you. Yet, there I was, freaking out, trying to lead my kids through my own panic. Spoiler: I wasn’t exactly killing it.
I was barking orders, making the experince miserable for everyone, demanding my kids follow my every barked order. Thank God for my wife, Tiffany Berardinelli   —she’s the real MVP. She brought calm to my chaos, stedying me and our whole family when I was sinking.

Looking back, I’m kinda embarrassed about how I acted. So, how’s this tie to business? Here’s what I learneda d how it might help you….

1.  Fear screws up performance. You can’t scare people into doing their best—it just doesn’t work. Calm, steady support (like my wife) is what helps people push through when they’re freaked out or worried.

2.  Put people in the right roles. Me, scared of heights, leading a hike full of sketchy ledges? Terrible call. Should’ve let Tiffany take the lead from the jump—she’s got the calm for it. I fought her for control out of fear, and that was dumb. Make sure your leader’s got the right headspace to bring peace to the team. It’s how people thrive.

3.  Always review your own performance, not just your team’s. Be real with yourself and course-correct, even if it means stepping back. Swallowing your pride to let someone better lead is tough—I didn’t do it on the hike, and it showed. You might be that person in your bisiness, and that’s okay, as long as you make the change.  That is real leadership.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great reflection and advice. I have to commend you on something you did that was positive:  learn from your experience. Even better…you shared the experience with others.

> **Response 2:** Went there last year. Most amazing trip! And having my kid up there who is an daredevil unlocks more fears, so I totally get it. Glad you're having a beautiful trip!

I would appreciate direction since I am clueless when it comes to websites and technology. What would be my cheapest and easiest option for a very simple website for a virtual PT/health coaching business. I am looking for a simple site, could like to have a “store” with links to affiliates and selling resources that I would send via email. Also looking for the cheapest/easiest way to schedule and take payment. Not sure if this is part of webpage ojust need ability to link to it. I have no clue what I’m doing here so any advice is appreciated. I can’t figure out where to start.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a site in Google. It was fine for my needs. I use Google claendar to schedule/let pts schedule. And wave app is free for collecting payments, other than the typical credit card fees. You can send invoices etc.

> **Response 2:** I have used Wix. It is about 30 a month. Very easy to use and the mobile app is decent. I have used siteground and Wordpress which is 10 a month but it way more of a headache

Looking for some advice. For those of you who started a side hustle while working FT and then transitioned to your business FT… At what point did you drop the full time job? 

I’ve been seeing 12-15 patients a week on my own while also working 35-40 hrs at my full time gig and I feel like I’m barely treading water. 😅 

I’m afraid to quit because of losing my insurance, and the fear of just relying on my business as income. Any guidance is appreciated. 🙂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 3 months

> **Response 2:** The time is now :) 12-15 is a great start! Be prepared that it can be financially tough for the first 6 months or so, but you've already got a good base. I also agree with others that if you weren't working the other job you could put full effort into your business. ❤️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There's a huge disconnect between what insurance companies tell patients and what they tell providers. This creates tension between providers and patients. If insurance only covers a few sessions a week, why can't we charge for wellness visits?

> **Response 2:** $950 (a class) vs $700 a month 1x a wk PT appt. out of pocket. People can’t keep up with $700 a month for an extended period of time. At that point your practice is only targeting those who can afford you. Yes, it really is disheartening our reimbursement rates because we shoukd be reimbursed closer to these rates. Are you all writing evaluations & notes for these prices?

Just listened to a podcast about a pool company who added a payment calculator to their website and their inbound leads went up by 200%. What do we think about adding a payment calculator to a website for cash pt?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think the main factor to consider here is that:

People WANT pools. Pools are aspirational in that they’re a status symbol, provide excitement and entertainment, and can be seen as raising the value of a home potentially.

Sadly, no one WANTS physical therapy. And honestly it would be weird for someone to want physical therapy (in the traditional sense of getting rehab for an injury).

Classic cost vs investment scenario. PT is seen as a cost whereas a pool is seen as an investment. 

Definitely worth giving it a shot but I don’t think it would drive leads. Just my guess!

> **Response 2:** I think it works great for an asset type product but prob not service based.

Hey guys- quick question.
I am 100% cash pay using gsuite for everything. Do i need to register as an OOP with a variety of insurances for my patients to receive reimbursment with superbills? I have a superbill template i created but have not actually had a pt attempt to use it yet. As of now the majority of my sessions are fitness and sport performance. I was reading an earlier post on this page that got me thinking about this….

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In being 100% cash based, you will be viewed as an out of network provider with all insurance. This is the language that they would use to refer to you. 
With this in mind, your patients need to be the contact for the insurance. We have had legal advisors tell us that speaking with the insurance would be a possible issue with HIPAA. 
We give the superbill when requested then if there are issues, ask the clients to call while in the office and we walk them through.

> **Response 2:** Hi, this is a bit of a piggyback on the original question.  I'm also self pay and provide superbills to patients.  Does anyone provide instructions to patients in written form of the steps when contacting their insurance or use an app for potential reimbursement?

I have a self-pay patient who I had been seeing for PT. she initially told me she has united health, I told her I didn’t take it so she was willing to pay cash and she was planning to submit the superbills. She later told me that she had BCBS (I am in network with them) but she had already submitted the superbills. Then they were kicked back to her for more documentation but the letters were coming from CMS. We found out that she actually has MCR (with whom I am a participating provider) and BCBS secondary. Furthermore, she put the wrong year birth date, making her age 10 years younger than her actual age, so I wouldn’t have even known that she was Medicare eligible. Anyway, she’s now trying to get reimbursed by Medicare for the cash pay visits we’ve had. I’m unsure what to do because I took cash pay from a Medicare beneficiary who I didn’t know was a Medicare beneficiary. Any advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is she who she says she is?  Bill MC and refund cash payments.

> **Response 2:** Not a big deal. Just bill Medicare and refund after you are paid.

Hey everyone taking the first steps to go uncaged!!! I found a nice space with decent rent in an independent gym. My game plan is to be in network with medicare and out of network with all others. 

In terms of medicare. I know that I will need yo apply for an LLC then take the EIN and tax ID and apply for a type 2 npi number and submit all that to medicare for approval. Does anybody know how long that approval process takes? 

In addition, for the out of network part…is there anything special I need to do for that part?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did all my own credentialing but Medicare was...a process. It took me forever. I dunno why I had such a hard time with it. It's just filling out the paperwork, really. BCBS was a much quicker process

> **Response 2:** I’m in the same boat, just a little further ahead. Medicare I heard anything from a week or two turn around to 30-60 days. OON from my research is nothing you really need to do. Just if a patient wants to submit a super bill to get some cost back they need to have out of network benefits and tend to be paid back in 1-2 weeks.

Spend a quarter of that budget on social media. I spend 200 a month on a video I made myself (tons of YouTube tutorials to show you how to do it and how to set the add to a targeted area or demographic and how to set your ad budget etc) and I get at least 1 new patient a month from it.

If an ad said, "Gait analysis is too complicated for everyday clinical practice" 

What would your response be? 

🤨

(edit: I should clarify that I think this is absurd, but I want the gut reactions from PTs)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This would be a fun activity to do every Friday... "Roast this marketing" 🤣

> **Response 2:** Am I working too hard? But also, to me gait analysis is second nature and I find myself analyzing gait at the Golden Corral, park, air port…. So…. What way too expensive gizmo are they trying to sell me? 🤨

Need help organizing my thoughts:

Earlier this month I left my job for personal reasons including taking care of my health and recovering from stress/burnout. 

The goal is to start developing my own gig slowly as I get ready to work again.

Problem is I have so many interests and not enough experience (about 14 months PT experience).

I think I want to start with offering PT, run coaching (am a certified run coach), and personal training/fitness coaching(no CPT cert yet). I already have two running clients (for free in return for feedback and word of mouth referral should they enjoy our work together). As for PT have yet to reach out to some local gyms and also considering mobile at home. Not to mentiontion other interestss i have and May eventually get more trainingg in…

I am just struggling to identify whether I am spreading myself too thin trying to start in all these fields and also what a cash based treatment schedule/programming could look like- i.e all in person PT/in person and virtual, run coach fees. I feel like personal training/fitness coaching is more straightforward. Then can I just put all these services under one LLC, do I need to keep anything separate. It’s just me….

Too many thoughts when I just want to jump in!

Mobile Therapists: How are you guys dealing with the anxiety of going to people’s homes? So I’ve been doing home health for a while and haven’t had trouble with it, but the referral always comes from a hospital or physician, etc. As a private practice, if I get a direct access, private paying patient, anyone could call me with any motive. Has anyone had a safety issue?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have been mobile for two years without issue. My practice is all word of mouth so there is always a connection to someone I know. 
Also just because someone is in the hospital being referred doesn’t always mean it’s safe. You still never know what you’re walking in to.

> **Response 2:** Search for past discussion on this. Word of mouth referrals kept me safe. I also screen everyone on the phone first, usually at least a 15 min phone call. If I’m going into a new situation, I’ll put pepper spray in my pocket/bag. 

In home health some of our nurses carried tazers. 

There’s a great book called The Gift of Fear.

So what is the absolute minimum you need to start to see patients on your own mobility or in home? 
My husband and I are planning to start our own cash side gig and hopefully grow it to a full time thing. 

Also how important is a social media presence because I am not a fan of posting things. Our kids are heavily involved in the community through church, sports, ect and we've coached a lot of teams and plan to market through our social networks of people we know in these areas and start there.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Liability and malpractice insurance are musts as well. 
I had treatment table
EmR 
Cleaning supplies (wipes, purel)
Fascia free 
Resistance bands
Balance pad
And the most important is your brain and how your evaluate and educate patients. 

My business has been mostly word of mouth and the occasional shoutout on some local community FB groups. Went from 2 days a week to five days a week In about 8 months and I see about 20-25 visits a week.
I’m fully mobile

> **Response 2:** To the best of my knowledge Ive never gotten any business from social media origin. 10.5 months running and I just entered patient #160   Most is word of mouth followed by HH agency referrals followed by me pursing a group of homes w developmental disabled adults.

**Original Post:**
Hypermobility + running expertise?  
Do you have advice on building tension/elasticity in floppy tissues?  Available for telehealth?

Goal:  Utilize running as part of my training plan for Grand Canyon Rim-Rim-Rim (4 days with daypack) in June 2024.

Background: 
I have mild EDS and continually hurt myself running.   
I ran track & cross country in high school, but haven’t been able to run as an adult.  I’m 41.
I’m great with vertical strength — Olympic weightlifting 4 days a week is my primary exercise. 
I can hike 5-8 miles with a backpack no problem. 15-22 miles with trekking poles.  
I do advanced level Pole dancing with minimal injury 1-2 days a week. 

BUT running is elusive.  

What I’m already doing:
— Soleus & Gastroc strengthening.  Some anterior tib. 
— Loading the forefoot/toes while strength training.  
* it was all going well until last week when I had a posterior Tib flare on the right & the talus jammed up on the left.  #feelingfrustrated 
— I use the Toe Pro and Mobo board inconsistently to work medial/lateral stability.  *Lateral and rotational stability likely needs more attention. 

Barriers:  Lack of a plan & knowledge of specific variables to optimize my training.  Feedback & problem-solving support.  Accountability.  ADHD + too many hobbies.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m hypermobile and I run! I have found success with isometrics, particularly hips/glutes. Running with a metronome can help with over-striding—when you’re floppy it’s easy to over-stride, and this can place more load on the distal musculature on impact. A metronome can help you maintain a cadence and keep some co-contraction of agonists/antagonists (particularly the hips) to keep a more stable proximal base. I use a cadence of somewhere between 160-180 bpm, there are playlists on Spotify that particularly cater to these bpm’s. Hope this helps!

> **Response 2:** I don’t have any advice about running, but I did a hiking R2R a few years ago in September when I was 45 (2 nights at Phantom Ranch so only carried a day pack.)  My 2 cents- the time I put in going up and down the stadium stairs at my local high school wearing my loaded pack that summer was the most beneficial training I did. If you haven’t joined them already, there are R2R and R2R2R fb groups that offer lots of great advice for first-timers. Good luck with your training and enjoy the canyon- there are definitely moments when you need to “embrace the suck” but it is an amazing experience 😊

Any of my mobile PTs have neck pain from looking down at patients feet all day long? Constantly looking down while patients walk, do step ups, balance, etc. Am I the only one?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Had severe neck pain in my 20’s/30’ while working all day in clinic and doing paperwork at counters…no more issues at 47 since  beginning McKenzie exercises (progress to chin tuck with ext),  daily foam roll routine for thoracic mobility, and pec MINOR stretching.  Must gain extension and mobility at CT junction, and start out working on this every 2 hours (don’t just wait til you get home at the end of the day).  Hope you feel better!

> **Response 2:** When I was first in Pilates training (before PT school), the teacher trainer encouraged us to “look with your eyes, not your head” because we could develop neck pain fully looking down on mats and reformers all day long. That stuck with me, along with the expectation that I should have proper posture if I was to preach it all day. Lying on a foam roller before bed also does wonders.

Has anyone ever asked to be at a PT/trainer at a school for athletes to check in on and possibly attend games? They have been left without an athletic trainer and their president is possbily interested in brining in an independent.  
SO...what would I even ask for?  A salary? A hourly pay?  Assuming I can go in and evaluate, treat like a PT?  I'm also a CSCS (strength & conditioning certification).  Can I do this even if I'm not an ATC?  I'm licensed in MN

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm a PT/ATC. I would check your practice act. Make sure you're comfortable with acute injury management: spineboarding, splinting,  concussion, return to play decisions. Expect lots of blood and using a lot of supplies you're not familiar with if never trained. You'll be dealing with split chins, nose bleeds, vomiting, heat illness, dehydration, etc. 

It's doable but must be ready for it all.

> **Response 2:** I’m a PT/ATC - I would check your state practice act for scope of practice. I would also make VERY sure that your insurance covers you. Hourly is going to be your best ask as far as pay. Games can last a really long time and coaches/schools will take advantage if you’re salary. I will also say - I’ve worked as a PT and I’ve worked as an ATC. I cannot stress enough how if you are on sidelines as medical personnel you need to be ready for anything and everything as far as emergency management and be prepared for the stress of coaches and parents screaming at you from the sidelines as you make decisions. The only part of my education that was the same was eval/rehab. Sideline coverage/emergency management was a big part of my AT education and not at all part of my PT education. Sideline coverage is a whoooooole other thing (and I hate it and don’t do it anymore lol).

**Original Post:**
**A big THANK YOU to everyone who posted their take, this was really helpful to navigate this situation. I am unable to respond to each one, but it was great to see the different perspectives. They helped me build a plan of action for how to proceed with my potential patients. Thanks again!!

Advice please: I run a small mobile private pay PT business and I’m still trying to build my caseload. There’s a potential patient who is asking for me to come meet him and his wife (also potential patient) at their home, ~30 min drive away.
This couple owns several restaurants in my city and are fairly well-off. This could be a good boost for my company, both as income and referral sources.
What I’m trying to decide is if I should go drive out to meet this couple (something I never do for free for other patients) or should I ask for a zoom meeting, instead?
I really want and need the business, but I don’t want my *desperation* to cloud my judgement. 
What makes the most sense to do?

Thanks, in advance!

Edit to clarify: I only mentioned 30 minute drive to highlight it’s not an easy drop-in for a free consultation. The drive to see this patient is not the issue, as it’s built into the session price.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Last year I drove 15.5 hours for FREE to see a patient at a large company just for the opportunity to gain their business. One year later, I might be looking at a whole region of locations because of this feat. Could it have been a $600 loss? Sure. 

BUT, I would rather spend that money with a direct face to face marketing opportunity then spending $100 on indirect marketing that likely won't work. These face to face opportunities are worth their weight in gold!

Go the extra mile, be THAT therapist. In a world of people kinda going for it, just go for it. Hold nothing back. ♥️

> **Response 2:** If you are building your business and you have the time, that is all it will cost you. The benefits sound like they far at weigh your time used. If you are great at what you do, you will not only gain 2 paying clients, but also a terrific future referral stream that could be HUGE for your business. I would highly recommend taking the time and going for that consult. People talking about it being offered as “free” need to understand that free consults should be priced into your visit costs and focus on having a high conversion rate. That is a great model for a successful business! Don’t get deterred by the drive or the “free” part, or anything else. Focus on giving a high quality service and letting that lead to future business growth! Big picture! Goodluck!

**Community Responses:**

Office manager took responsibility for learning the billing end of things and I’m still catching up on learning that. Kind of a long onboarding to learn it all but overall it has been better than the other system used and has more support. I would recommend personally if your plan is to grow.

For those of y'all who started as generalists/see everyone/jack of all trades.....and niched down, what was your thought process? How did you land on? What has become your single focus? Did you just pick an Avenue, figure out which avatar was the most profitable or which one you enjoyed working with the most? Just looking for feedback and mindset for narrowing down. Thanks y'all! ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had to learn by picking the wrong niche first … I was feeling frustrated and wasn’t sure why.  Once I really took a deep dive into where that frustration came from it gave me more clarity on the direction I needed to go.

> **Response 2:** I know this answer might not be for you or anyone else around here but you asked how we niched down. 

I specifically asked God what He wanted me to do. Then did it. Nothing like the Lord directing your steps.

One of the whys we all want is time freedom. Mine is coming from more of a personal reason or family need. I have been working in home health for the flexibility of scheduling. But have to leave the company I am with because it is overwhelming. But I am a father of a soon to be 16 yo autistic son high functioning but have to put him into virtual schooling and he looses out on extra curricular activities he was in high school he enjoys. Because me and my wife both work in health care and don’t have abilities to take him or pick him up from these activities if he chose to stay in high school where he is now. 
So to anyone else who has a child with special needs, I can understand a big why we do what we strive to do with our businesses. Not a rang but sharing my story and struggles because I know I am not alone. Thanks for reading. Now have a crushin week y’all. 👊🏻

Looking to change the name of my LLC. Is it easier to: 

1- create a new LLC, get a new EIN, and new bank account then switch over my online courses to this account
2- amend the current LLC name, amend the name with the IRS (EIN), and amend the name on the bank account and keep all my material as is

Considering it took the IRS 2+ months to get my husbands EIN due to naming similarities I am worried they are going to be nice and slow…. Anyone have experience with this and can give their two sense?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, do a DBA. Mine took 24 hours (legal zoom messed up my name). You file a form with the state, and then your LLC is “Doing Business As” the new name. Same EIN and everything. In Montana it was like $10 to change

> **Response 2:** You could just add a DBA (doing business as) name.

Received a voice message yesterday that said “This bootcamp has been an absolute life saver for me!”

Starting a business can be a lot more simple when given the right guidance. 

It’s my goal with Bootcamp to NOT give you an over abundance of information, but to give you the EXACT guidance you need to create the proper foundation for your business 👊

It’s not too late to jump in, we have 2/4 trainings left and you will be given access to the recordings of the first two trainings!

There is no time like the present to start building the right foundation for your dreams and not continuing to build someone else’s. 

Bootcampers, y’all have been a blast to coach so far! 

If you want more info, link is in the comments 👇

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Best $ I ever spent. I spent the last 6 months overthinking so much. The guidance this group is covering is priceless!

> **Response 2:** Do you think this would be good for a pediatric PT in a small town?! I still haven't done a discovery call yet either!!

Hi all,

I am in the process of starting a concierge cash mobile PT business. I know pricing on visits is a common question and I keep going back and forth on what to charge. My plan is to offer packages with the main one being basically unlimited visits until they meet their goals for $5000. Obviously there is going to be some stipulations for that to avoid people taking advantage. Otherwise, the goal will be to charge about $285 a visit. I am located in the Prescott/Prescott Valley area in Arizona. 

Looking for thoughts and opinions on this and what other mobile cash PTs have charged.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We are hybrid so I have two styles 

Cash only 
I’ve done this. We do 10k for the year. Unlimited treatment plans 

2k per month unlimited or 5500 for 3 months. For say like ACL R or TKA type thing. 

Also have an annual membership for the insurance side 
1500/year  annual wellness stuff plus discounts on cash services
4500/year  basically large discounts on cash services. Fitness. Exercise programming nutrition shockwaves ultrasound imaging etc 

We do have a B&M so that helps with more services to offer vs just the mobile providers.

To add. We’ve never had a single membership person overuse their membership. They actually understood the value and probably used it much less than say your typical insurance patient who expects the moon

> **Response 2:** Love seeing you building a concierge PT model that puts patients first! Curious what specific stipulations you’re including to protect your time with the $5K unlimited package. Also, what are other mobile cash PTs in the area charging per hour?

I’m considering renting space from a local clinic, and they’re proposing a percentage split with a cap, allowing me to earn 100% after the cap is reached. For those who’ve done something similar, what do you think is a fair split and cap?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I pay my CrossFit gym $15 a visit capped at 10 visits a week. Monthly the most I will ever pay is $600. But if I take a vacation for a week and see 60 visits the other 3 weeks, it’s technically only $450. I haven’t had that happen yet but that’s an option too

> **Response 2:** A percentage is only going to cut into your biggest asset that you need right now: revenue. Just counter with a flat rate and see what they say. No harm in asking for what you want.

Just an fyi to anyone that uses Square. I set up afterpay which allows 25% of the balance to be paid every 2 weeks. So it breaks the balance into 4 equal payments. One today… one in 2 weeks...one in 4 weeks and one in 6 weeks. Sooo $1000 would be $250x4. 0% interest to the customer.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How are you bypassing some of the processing fees here? Business Venmo doesn’t charge me to transfer to my bank account where square does. And Venmo seems to be less of an up front processing fee.

> **Response 2:** After pay is a higher percentage for the business though

My husband and I own the business and we have several therapists and finally a front office person. We have been solely using his phone for business (was fine when we were smaller but since growth and front office we need something else). 

Do we buy another phone to add to our Verizon plan for the business line for our front office person to use? Perks to change our Verizon plan to a business plan? 

Other options? Cost effective options? 
Google voice…..but how does that work with front office person?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Indeed. I don’t love it but have tried most everything and it’s the only one I consistently get resumes from. We do hire a lot tho (3-4 therapists monthly on average). Indeed seems to be only one to have enough volume but is wildly over priced for ads IMO

How do you go about trying to regain a doctors office’s attention after a lull of no referrals? One office sent to me right off the bat and the doctor said he likes to support entrepreneurs. I dropped off some doughnuts and a card thanking them and haven’t gotten another referral since! Would like to try and get their attention again. Advice/thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've honestly had better luck going straight to the patient. My patients then go tell their providers

> **Response 2:** James DiPiazza  go with a patient to their appointment. Shows the doc you're invested, helps the patient out, and you look good to both. Score some free 1:1 (2:1) time with the doc. I gotta give credit to Anthony Maritato for this.

Thoughts?  Saw this posted on a FB page for a concierge physician.  I never introduce myself as doctor, but I periodically have patients call me doctor.  I try to explain the difference, but this article steps into muddy territory.  From the article seems the NP clearly stated her degree online.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** funny...never had my chiro nor dentist have to tell me they are such after calling themselves Dr.

> **Response 2:** Chiros always verbally introduce themselves as doctors and Ive never heard them having to pay a ridiculous fine like this.  On a side note, I believe PTs need to do a better job with introducing themselves as doctors, as it helps a lot with bringing more perception of value in what we do.

When you hire an assistant as a mobile therapist are you doing 1099 or w2?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a PT & recently hired a PTA and I was advised (due to my mentor’s lawyer’s advice) that an assistant cannot be 1099 due to them needing supervision of a therapist.  So they cannot function independently as a 1099, only employee.

> **Response 2:** I would be extremely careful about hiring as a 1099. There are both IRS and state laws regarding this and many states are becoming much more vigilant about auditing small businesses for this. I have been through an audit it is very difficulty to prove that they fit the 1099 IC route in most situations for an assistant. Please get very good legal advice on this and be prepared to face an audit on it. The penalties can be significant.

I’m sitting here renumerating… if that’s the right word trying to respond to a response to an offer I made to a PT. It would be my first W2 employee PT. I’m kind of fearful. She asked a few questions that are easy to answer and of course more money. I just keep crunching numbers and get scared I can’t afford it or the what if’s. The unknown expenses I don’t know to factor in yet. What if…. I don’t really want to split hairs. I’ve worked soooo hard to get to where I am. This is an investment that I expect to pay out at first and get my return swiftly. 

I don’t know what’s holding me back. That little nagging voice? 
A few thousand dollars on the offer 
Counter the counter ? 
It’s not a marketplace purchase its a salary 

Can anyone give me somethin? I don’t know what I need ahhhh🙄

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First, you recognize that this is an investment 👍👌

Aside from that, what is the mission for the practice? What are your goals for your employees? 
Do you want your employees to feel empowered in their roles, to be able to have creativity, to feel a sense of time freedom, to feel as though they have a measure of control?
If you allow them to experience the good that you have experienced by escaping corporate healthcare, then you will have more dedicated employees who are happy.  They, in turn, pass that along to the clients.  
The results are raving fans who become your best marketers.
And that leads to a higher ROI.
That investment “cost” ends up being a small dollar amount to you, but a very good amount for (her).

> **Response 2:** I'm kinda in the same head space right now. Need to hire someone, but scared about the investment/cost up front. Don't want to pay them too much but also not too little. I'm going 1099 route, I think. But I like all the advice here 🙂

Clinicians that treat TMJ/TMD do you have any tips for getting started in that field?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good background education understanding the interrelationships between the head/neck/tmj, then reviewing common pathologies, studying surgeries, then shadow local maxillofacial surgeons and dentists in the area. 

If that doesn’t work bring donuts

> **Response 2:** I've found a good local dentist is the easiest in.  Like all offices make friends with the office people and they will get you in front of the the dentist.  I usually say something like I specialize in TMJ and wondered how I could help yall out.  Bridging to an orthodontist and now I have a surgeon who will refer before he sees someone pretty often.  Takes time, be consistent and send a letter when you see the patient not a copy of your evaluation.  Other than that what's been said above.  DM if you have any other questions.

Hi everyone! I’m close to launching my virtual personal training business (geared towards people with invisible illnesses- POTS, Long Covid, etc.) and could use some help. 
I am in need of consent form, waivers, and general screening forms. 
I was also wondering if anyone had a form made up stating that the client understands that this is not a physical therapy session (I’m a PTA).

Any recommendations for liability insurance and the best company to go through for selling merchandise (hats, t-shirts, etc.). I’m considering going through Etsy, but didn’t know if there was a better option. 

Thanks in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d love your info. There are a lot of people in my area looking for help with POTS and we lack any good specialists

For those of you that are OON/cash and take Medicare part B. Are you still charging your normal rate, having them sign an ABN and then submitting the claim on their behalf, but still collecting your full rate at time of service? I'm just wondering if it is worth starting to take Medicare, but their reimbursement is typically garbage, so I'm just wondering what people out there are doing. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Legally you can't do that. You agree to accept what Medicare pays a full payment for Medicare covered services.

> **Response 2:** If your schedule is full, and you can get it full with cash pay patients, of course that’s going to be more financially feasible. For me, Medicare patients pay well enough to make it worth being in network with them. You cannot have them sign an ABN as a blanket Coverage at the beginning of every treatment. You only have them sign an ABN when they are doing a treatment that you don’t expect to be covered like after the KX modifier. (I believe)
I like having a mixture of Medicare and cash pay.

If you want to know what is wrong with healthcare in this country, look no further than this. Insurance companies and 3rd party administrators like ASH and Multiplan getting incentivized to deny claims or cut payments to obtain a percentage of the "savings" from the employer self funding the plan. Meanwhile the healthcare provider loses out on reimbursement or the patient is stuck holding the bag having to make up the difference. All while the insurance company and 3rd party laugh all the way to the bank. Complete sham of a process.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We recently dropped Cigna/ASH at the clinic I work at because we had a contracted rate of $65/visit and out of nowhere they decided to only start paying us $32/visit. After arguing with them for over 6 mos my boss just said, “fine. We’re no longer taking your pts.” Then they decided to come up to $50 but since that’s still shy of what we’re supposed to get, my boss laughed and still said no. A lot of disappointed pts, but they all seem to understand for the most part

> **Response 2:** I saw a lawyer today on social media who was informing clients and the public of tactics that certain insurance companies have of just flat out refusing to pay as long as possible, to the benefit of the insurance companies’ bottom line. 

I’m about to make a post about this, and start sharing this sort of thing. I think providers should. What do you think?

So I’m finally going to quit my outpatient Ortho job to pursue my cash business full time. I’ve had my business since 2019 so I’m ready. I’ve only kept my ortho job because of family insurance but after finally having needing to use my insurance for my sons emergency surgery we have painfully learned that it’s really not worth keeping. ￼So as I go to full independence I’ll need another insurance for emergencies. Can anyone give me their favorite health share company?? We live in MN if that matters

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use medishare. My parents use CMN. Keep in mind both of them ￼ will not cover pre-existing conditions

> **Response 2:** We do covered California it’s 1700 for family of 4. I’m a cancer survivor so I felt more comfortable with a gold plan since I have check ups, etc. I couldn’t do any of the cheap ones with my history. But 1700 isn’t that much more than I was paying at my prior employer- it was 1200 for family at old job…

So made a few calls for a billing company and I'm truly feeling overwhelmed.
- company 1:  charged for everything-  credentialing, contracting with insurances, benefit checks and billing. Everyone of those above categories had a fee of at least $200 or  percentage of 6.5%  to 7% depending on what they would be doing for me and how much I made monthly.
I know this is standard but I legit felt ky hair falling off with how much I'd be paying them to work for me.

- company 2 sounds to good to be true. They charge based on how much I make monthly. This includes benefit checks and billing. Adding to this if I make under a certain amount every month they collect nothing. So in other words, they'd work for free?
They are also willing  to do some upfront with as well such as finding out what insurances maybe best suited to take if any at no cost.

Credentialing and contracting would be a different price based on how many insurances I'd like to take.

But I just can't understand why they'd work so hard for me if I make less than a particular amount which going in, I know I will based on how many patient visits I'd like to start with. Is this truly to good?

While I'd like to ideally have billing done in house down the road, at this moment I'm just feeling like I understand nothing of how to run a business. 
What are some things you took into consideration when hiring a billing company? Are there billing companies you can recommend as well. I'd like to compare a few more.

I know I can't be the only one that feels lost 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you just now starting your business as a solo provider?

If so, I highly recommend learning how to bill yourself initially until you have a caseload to justify someone else doing it. Also, once you understand it yourself, then you will know if the billing company is actually doing what you need them to do. 

If you have an EMR that does integrated billing it’s actually fairly simple once it’s set up. I do my own billing for me and my 2 PTs with no problem using HENO.

> **Response 2:** I agree with this. Also depending on your insurances accepted/patient volume it is very simple to verify benefits as well. It takes me about 1 minute to verify BCBS benefits.

You guys always have good answers for this type of question…￼

I will be done with my current company in December with my medical insurance lasting me until the end of the year. All along, I have been looking to put my family on Medishare as we have used this before in the past with a great experience/no issues. The plan I have been looking at for me and my family would cost us roughly $300 a month for a very high deductible (annual household portion as Medishare calls it).￼ We have no issue with the extremely high deductible, as we have very little to no medical expenses throughout the year. ￼

There is also another option available to us in Texas that would put us on a more typical health insurance plan for only $90 more a month. My initial plan was to just go with the cheaper option (Medishare) for the reasons stated above. ￼

My question is regarding tax deductions for paying insurance premiums. I know that Medishare would not be tax deductible as it is not traditional insurance. The other option would be tax deductible since it is health insurance. Would the $90 a month difference make it worth the tax deduction at the end of the year? ￼

I plan to ask this question to my accountant but she is unavailable over the holiday week next week. I need to start applications for these options soon so trying to get advice from anyone who knows from experience. Thanks.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I will follow this because we do the 400 dollar a month family plan with 8000 AHP with Medi-Share! I would say it probably won’t make too much of a difference as a write off, but I’ve never done it so I wonder how much it gets you. We have loved Medi-Share and I don’t think we’ll switch. Do you mind sharing what the other plan you’re looking at? Since I’m in Texas too!!

> **Response 2:** I have had medishare … 3000 ded. Never a prob.

***Stick with me here...***

What YOU can pull from the recent *Cracker Barrel* fiasco.

Cracker Barrel has been an iconic establishment since first opening its doors in Lebanon, TN in 1969.

One can drive along any highway and find a packed Cracker Barrel parking lot.

To so many, it has been a place of comfort food; reminding them of going to their grandmother's for Sunday lunch.

With the founder, "Uncle Herschel", now no longer with us, the company decided to hire a marketing firm to ensure its continued success.

This is where things went south for the company.

Again, *stick with me...*

There was a major uproar nation wide over the proposed changes.

The very loyal customer fan base let their displeasure be known, and in a very short amount of time, Cracker Barrel LOST $100M in revenue.

Yes, **$100 MILLION**.

What was really the culprit for the people who love Cracker Barrel to become disenfranchised with the company?   Cracker Barrel became disconnected with the people who willingly drove an extra few miles down the road to receive what they had to offer.

Deeper still, it was the fact that a marketing firm convinced the store to build something that they (the marketing firm) wanted to create.

Do you think said marketing firm understood Cracker Barrel's customers? Nope.

The result?  Unhappy customers feeling as though they had no where to go.

***How does this relate to you?***

Experts on reading X-rays can you tell me what is wrong with the hip. TIA
Update- I uploaded better X-ray quality. I think pic was taken at wierd angle.  I have not seen this patient. Patient is family friend who is visiting USA and X-ray were taken in India. Ortho said that she has problem with her SI joint and that is from birth. Her symptoms are pain over low back pain, gluteal muscles and hamstrings.

**Community Responses:**

Any advice on how to explain to a physician that the normal 2-3 sessions/week for 6 weeks for physical therapy isn’t always necessary? I treated a young athlete for 5 sessions (1x for 5 weeks). Patient has met all goals and able to dance without pain or dizziness. Her physician is concerned because i didn’t have her complete 12 sessions and wants the patient to continue to finish 12 sessions.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** In my opinion it's the perfect time to market yourself as a clinician that emphasizes individualized treatment and goals that allow your patients to get better in fewer visits than what is considered standard. Don't be afraid to separate yourself from the pack.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes.

> **Response 2:** What Chris said, and you don't want to just throw spaghetti at the wall for ads. It'll get real expensive fast with little return. Get your systems straight first, then get your ad copy right. And be sure they are setup correctly ie audience, geographic area, etc. William Boyd is a great resource for this and if he can't help you, he can point you to who can. You def need to learn the ad platforms and copywriting before putting money in.

Anyone in a cash practice offers massage or MFR sessions in their clinical practice as an additional revenue stream? 

Who provides the service? Do you have a massage therapist on staff or does the PT provide this service if the schedule is not full? 

Any legal aspects to keep in mind? Do patients fill out the same intake forms and payment agreements?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am an OT & John F Barnes Myofascial Release (JFB MFR) is my specialty. This is quite different from other forms of MFR. Lots of people specifically seek this modality especially when traditional therapy has not been successful for them. The legality of having someone working on staff will depend on the state. I operate under my OT license in a direct access state. If you're looking for providers doing JFB MFR check out MFR Insight

> **Response 2:** I have a massage therapist in my clinic - I provide her the space - she maintains her license and insurance and pays me 20% per client.  She does her own scheduling and handles her clients payments - so it is a win/win for me.  I have referred several patients to her and vice versa!

Thinking about switching to putting our intake forms on the iPad, we have like 10 pages of intake forms for all of our treatment consent forms and cancellation policy and everything. It’s been such a waste of paper and the ink/paper is expensive.

Have any of you used an iPad for intake forms and have you found your elder patients to be able to do it on there? I was worried some of them would have difficulty using it via iPad?

If I were to put the intake forms on the iPad. What app or software could I use for that?

Thanks again!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Jane app and send my intake forms prior to the appointment. If the haven’t filled it out, then I bring my iPad for them to fill it out

> **Response 2:** LOVE intakeQ ($40ish/month no contract for forms only). I just switched over and it’s so user friendly for the provider and patient. I can send the link to complete forms to their phone or email and it’s all electronic. Plus creating the forms was simple or you can pay $10/form for the system to create it for you. I opted in to their practice management software instead which is forms and scheduling/billing ($75/month no contract) just due to how simple and user friendly it is so when I schedule an eval they automatically get the intake forms and/or a zoom link for virtual clients. Plus I set it up to automatically bill the patients since I do private pay but used to use insurance so it could bill their co-pays and integrated with office ally easily. My older clients do it with a breeze! Don’t underestimate them, esp when the systems are more simplified now. Try it for free. You don’t even need to put your billing info in during the two week trial so can get a real feel for it. Love this one, Hate clinic source

Who has “passive income” by doing more generic exercise programs/exercise library for clients? I have a passion for helping those with pacemakers,etc as I myself have had a PM/ICD since age 24. I’ve seen a huge disparity in care after surgery and realize how many people would be better off with even generic appropriate stretching, strengthening programs within precautions. Many aren’t recommended PT after surgery and don’t know where to start. Any thoughts on how I’d do this or ideas on where to start with setting this up?
I am part of multiple PM groups and many people expressed interest but how do I get the word out without breaking group rules? Lol or just marketing this in general(outside of my city/state)?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a membership that is patient education based about starting exercise, pain relief and injury prevention that has an exercise library. I have a course platform (just moved to thrivecart) and right now I have unlisted YouTube videos and it’s linked in an airtable base. 

I’m looking into other software like searchie, softr, and spread simple that is more of a searchable database functionality that can be password protected. 

I’ve been working at this stuff for a while now and would be happy to chat if you have questions 🙂

Looking for stories of people who started their own practice within 1-2 year of graduating and working. Dealing a lot with the impostor syndrome and acceptance of having so much to learn and still being uncomfortable with certain conditions/body parts (but of course willing to learn), but itching to get out of the corporate world and doing my own thing without fear of ruining my business’s reputation for being too novice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started right out of the gate after I passed boards! I am mobile and did a segment on this with David Bayliff actually all about this! I’m mobile pelvic floor!

> **Response 2:** Having a business coach was life changing for me! I built my practice from the ground up and sold it last year to go into full time coaching, because I found such a love for growing both personally and as a mentor. I would love to work with you if you decide to move forward! Good luck 🤍

Before I look it up… I have a request by a daughter of a potential mobile PT patient if I can do her weekly fasting glucose during my visit. I’m not asking if I can BILL for it. Just asking about the act of doing it. Illinois here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pretty sure no. 

I remember learning to do the glucose tests (super easy) in school and then they were like oh btw don’t do this with patients lol.

> **Response 2:** Isn’t the weekly fasting glucose usually a blood draw for labs?  I’ve never seen a fasting glucose reading from a finger prick.  I have seen PTs do glucose monitoring before, but fasting glucose reading she would probably have to have a nurse or go to a lab.

Had an interesting experience. My daughter suffered an accident sledding and got hurt. They have in our area an orthopedic specific urgent care. 
The receptionist asks what happened, goes inside and come back with an X-ray slip. You do X-ray and return. They then have a certified athletic trainer call us in, take history measure ROM, strength, and some tests… and finally an ortho comes in for 5-10 min, reads X-ray, palpates, do an US, and gives his opinion. ATC then returns to teach how to use crutches.
That was a new experience for me and I am curious on how they bill for ATC…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Most likely they are not billing it. They are using the AT much like a medical assistant. I have worked in a practice that uses this model. The benefit of ATs in the ortho urgent care model like this is really great imo.

How do you go about asking clients for a Google review?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Once they start noticing attention progress I end the session saying something like "I'm glad that you have noticed a change in the quality of your life. It's a moment like that which makes me do what I want to do so I can keep helping people like you. Would you mind leaving as a review of the quality of service I've been able to provide you so that others can know there is hope for them just like you have experienced? 

Then I send them a text like this:

Hi ___, Thank you again for trusting me to help you to regain confidence with ___. It's always great to hear when people like you feel more confident and empowered to do more than you thought was possible. 

Below is a link for my business page  and I would consider it a gift if you would take 60 seconds to let others know about the experience I've been able to provide for you to start getting back to find what you love.

> **Response 2:** We ask

Does anyone have recommendations for good rehab products to sell in clinic? 

Would love to learn about more revenue generating products that are helpful to patients. Eg. Good quality Pillows, products for better posture etc. 

Also, how do you decide your profit margins on these products? 

I am looking for products that have good profit margins. Don’t want to engage in sales conversations for products with bare minimum revenue.

Or if you did it yourself, how difficult is that and comparative cost?

Edited to add: my wife is building an online retail business using shopify and she recommends it. I can't tell if this platform will do what I'm looking for, or if it's geared more toward retail. Anyone familiar with shopify?

Did anyone in this awesome group start and successfully grow an OON/direct pay brick-and-mortar practice without going mobile first, and without pre-established referral sources? Would love to connect.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm brick and mortar, it's a great base, and now working on building the online presence.

> **Response 2:** I started brick and mortar, OON, no referral sources. Initial start up was $13,000 from my savings and never had to put my own money in after that. Now, I also did not get a paycheck for 2 years after that as I rolled all the money I made into the business. It's certainly an option and I am happy to chat if it would help. I think it depends on what you NEED to make in order to live your life. For me, I was able to get insurance through my husband and he was able to cover living expenses while I got this company off the ground. But, I understand that is not true for everyone. I think that mobile offers the opportunity to put more money in your pocket from the beginning due to low overhead. The question is - what do you need and what do you want?

**Original Post:**
Vulnerability. 

I share some of my personal struggles because it's important for people here to see a couple different things. 

1.  It's possible to LOVE life and still have struggles. I love what I get to do, I love who I get to work with, I'm proud of what I've accomplished and live an amazing life. I also struggle with doubts, mindset and mental health issues, and have days that are hard. This is life and even though it seems like people who are successful never have a bad day, thats BS. 
1. It's ok for a leader to show vulnerability. In fact, it's essential. I can't do things on my own. I need others to help me. I need to recognize that despite my best efforts I'll fall short unless surrounded by others to help support me. There's a misconception that building a business on your own is the "courageous" way of doing it. We live in a society where individual work is celebrated and using a team or others to support you is often seen as "cheating" (see school as an example). Trying to do things on your own will get you limited results and the primary reason that people do things on their own is PRIDE. They don't want to show vulnerability because of their pride so they do things on their own and never admit they need help. So by showing my vulnerability I hope to help people see that the smart way, the brave way, the courageous way of doing things is to recognize limitations and ask for help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is exactly what I have found out and am taking action on with myself and my team. Thank you for sharing since this resonates with me so much!

> **Response 2:** This resonates with me so much! Probably one of the biggest lessons I have been learning since starting my practice.

I was approached by a local business owner of a well known PT clinic chain about inviting me to involved in his new business idea. He wants to put together a clinic site completely unrelated to his own clinics that would be modeled like a hair studio in that it would be a facility independent clinicians could rent space from individually. He is thinking to offer a la cart services like billing or scheduling and the independent providers would take or leave what they want and use space by time or client. This was a fast conversation. In the past I’ve been invited to work for him and I always said no thank you. He was not specific about my role. He just thought someone doing what I’m doing would be an asset to his idea. What is your reaction to this idea?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1st… Why have you always said “No thank you”?

> **Response 2:** I contracted like this is NYC, slightly different as the place didn’t have all the “stuff” I would have wanted/needed but it was awesome to have a space to work when I went in.  I paid per hour and would have paid more if there was more stuff I could use as well.  I know many clinicians that want to dabble on their own but space is an issue.  Could totally work in the right area I’m sure

This is kinda gross but also amazing. Someone dropped this kebab stick and within about 30 min it was swarming with tiny ants. 

We were fascinated watching them and realized that these tiny ants, working together towards a common goal, were able to move that stick.

The power of teamwork right there.

Why is anyone giving a penny of their money to this company? Any employer any employee. If these are your benefits at work, that’s all you have to know about your employer. Take their money and buy insurance elsewhere. We all know they pay the worst for a physical therapy visit so I have the insurance and why being network? Someone has to stop the insanity because that’s exactly what it is.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My husband is part of insurance negotiations for his work (a medium size non-profit). UHC is literally the only insurance company that would quote them. BCBS and Cigna both declined to even quote them, so they’re stuck with UHC and as a non-profit they can only afford so much. He is fighting to change it next year based on what he’s learned from me as a OON provider, but it’s been an uphill battle. I wish we would stop villainizing the employers.

> **Response 2:** Yeah I follow her videos. It's really sad what she has to go through to advocate for her patients... The system is so broken!

New PP owner and billing newbie!…I called UHC to see if a client has OON benefits as I’m only credentialed with Medicare, I was told I could see the client and did not need authorization. Co pay would be $70

Client agreed to copay and I treated for 4 sessions. I just got the EOB in the mail and the member responsibility for Eval was $25 (not $70) and then member responsibility for 2/3 treatment visits was $0 (haven’t received the last tx eob)

Since the client no longer needs therapy I’m obviously going to reimburse. I have one more EOB im waiting to get back - I’m wondering if I should wait in case that shows $25? 

Also Is the EOB final or is it possible UHC will come back requesting the initial $70 they had said or $25 for the tx visits they charged $0??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is why you let the patient deal with submission for out of network benefits, in my opinion. You end up calling out of the good of your heart, spending your time, and then given the wrong information. Then, you get next to nothing back. It’s unfair to you as the provider.

**Community Responses:**

I am finally creating an LLC in order to treat 2-3 patients a week. Yay! But I have so many questions. I am in Chattanooga, TN and will be treating in a dance studio. Is this the correct order of operations?
1.Get EIN
2.Form LLC
3.Register business with state 
4.File for business license in county 
5.Get liabilty insurance
6.Treat patients

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If they are treating in a dance studio, it's unlikely they will be seeing Medicare, so that piece might be a moot point. A few things I would add to the list, create a business bank account and get a business only debit card to make taxes much easier,  determine EMR system, create/personalize paperwork for clients - consents, patient policies, intake forms, payment forms, etc. (and remember even if you are cash only, technically you will need a Good Faith Estimate form), and create a policy manual (even if it's just you!) I have 3 studio based clinics and now we have 15 therapists total, so we definitely have to have a policy and procedure manual, but even for my own personal clinic that is just me, I have a document that lists out all my policies -- like cancellation policy for patients, termination policy for patients that aren't a good fit, when I'll do my inventory, how I'll disburse my payments to myself etc. It's one page for my practice, but its helpful to keep me on track! Good luck!

Hi!
Just signed the lease on my first brick and mortar space! Yay!
Cash practice + in network with Medicare, so will need a EMR that will support me doing my own billing for MCR and creating superbills for cash people who want to submit on their own for reimbursement. 

So far I am between Jane and Prompt. Anyone have thoughts? I am looking to keep costs low since it’s just me.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Prompt! I never had to worry about billing. Very easy to use. Keep an open mind, especially with the price. But it sure is worth every penny. 

And hi! I’m in Queens, NY!

> **Response 2:** I’m in the same boat as you Danielle Danielle Weis.  If Prompt could just come down in price during the early phases I would go for that.  I do like Jane’s Part Time Plan to keep overhead down. I’m interested to see what the group has to say.

For people who have small spaces but believe in heavy lifting, what do you feel is the most versatile piece of equipment for loading patients?

I currently have only a small room and have a pair of 15# and 35# dumbbells which has been limiting when I want to really load up for instance a deadlift. I don’t have room for a barbell or plates so I was thinking about getting a heavy kettlebell but then thought maybe I should just get heavier dumbbells or something else altogether. 

Would love any input! Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Adjustable dumbbells/kettlebells (+lifting straps if grip is an issue) is one immediate change you can make. Another option is to think about what you'd like to accomplish? tissue tolerance? hypertrophy? you can use tissue tolerance exercises (e.g. drop sets, isodynamic sets, high reps) or strength endurance exercises like KB swings/snatches/squats/presses for time.

If you been working for an OPPT employer and they give you a non-compete contract after working for 1-2 years, can the employer fire you  for not signing the contract if you don't agree on the terms?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** they can absolutely fire u in my state.  Non competes can also be enforced in court.  they are legally binding contracts.  the employer may choose not to enforce it.  the non compete may be written poorly and therefore difficult to enforce.  but if the non compete is sound, and it is clearly violated, it can be legally enforced.

> **Response 2:** They’re not enforceable so don’t worry about it.

**Original Post:**
What is the logistics of starting a Home Health Company?  We are an outpatient neuro clinic and was wondering how feasible is it to start a home health company that is neuro specific? 😝

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have 7 outpatient physical therapy clinics. We opened a home health agency 14 years ago too. 

We are independent in both and have so many experienced clinicians.  I am the director of therapy for the outpatient and Administrator for the home health company.  

It’s a lot harder to open the home health company.  You have to so much money in an account to show and basically treat the first 10 Medicare patients for free (it was 14 years ago). A lot more regulations for licensing.  Must have a Director of Nursing and the policies and procedures are totally different.  I been through 4 state surveys for both.  Nothing is the same except the emergency preparedness plan we have to maintain for both. We have two 
separate companies and two separate EMRS and billing.  

I feel home health is not patient generated and driven only by discharge planners.  I’m not sure how much a specialist would do as visits could be limited.  People generally do not have freedom of choice.  The hospitals dictate agencies then if they go to a SNF, they tend to dictate who is picked.  

I personally feel the best way to be a specialist and be sought out is only through outpatient at home.  Not home health. If you want to get into home health , contract with a home health agency first.  

We have so many outpatient therapists that specialize that also do home health, and it does not generate additional business in home health. We are a top provider in outpatient in our area but it never has helped us in home health.

My wife worked in home health for years  and was a Parkinson’s specialist.  She left her home health company (different than the one I’m in charge of and it was owned by a hospital) and started a separate outpatient at home business.  She does so much more business as an outpatient provider using her specialty.  

So, basically I have seen outpatient, outpatient at home, and home health through 3 different companies.

Winning formula = contract yourself out to home health agency, see patients for the plan of care. Once the agency discharges, go in as outpatient provider with through indoor self pay. Agencies are limiting home-health visits and patients have such a need after discharge.

> **Response 2:** I don't think neuro patients would be as profitable because they will require a lot more intensity of care, more visits and likely more disciplines involved. Majority of the time our neuro patients were getting PT, OT, ST, MSW, nursing, and HHA.

For those of you who went from mobile ➡️ brick and mortar 🏣do you have any regrets?  Why did you make the switch?  Any other words of advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Approx 90% of my practice is still mobile but I have a brick and mortar space that I rent from a prosthetist colleague. Like others said, it fulfilled a mission to collaborate on patients with limb loss and offer a space for older adults. The caseload hasn't grown in the brick and mortar ad I had hoped but I smile every time I put my key in the door and see my logo on the wall so I'm gonna keep it going for a while and see if I can make it work!

> **Response 2:** I still provide mobile visits but also wanted to have a brick n mortar space to fully live out the vision I have.   I think it’s important to really think out what you want to do with your business and if having a clinic space helps move you toward that goal.  For me I envisioned having a space that I could host workshops and education seminars to help the community and I wanted to be able to offer other services that can’t be provided in a mobile setting.

I also think it’s important not to rush into a space, make sure it’s the best fit for you before taking the leap.

Hi.  What is the difference between Mobile PT and home health?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A lot less documentation

> **Response 2:** Home Health is billed under Medicare part A, physicians have to sign orders and patients have to be home bound , usually only lasting a couple of weeks, falls under PDGM, must have qualifying verbage in clinical notes for medical necessity.  Mobile PT is OP PT in home, billed under Medicare PArt B, only needs a script, pt does not need to be home bound, treatments are closer to an hr and duration can be longer than HH.

In other words, focus your attention more on doing what you do well rather than numbers.

Looking to hear any experience with using  StemWave in your practice. Both with the company/device itself and with patient results.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a StemWave device. It works wonders.  You can use it over prosthesis.  It is a shockwave therapy… but when you look into the type of wave they are all slightly different.  StemWave has the highest amplitude sound wave out of all of them…. Making the cells think they have microtrauma stimulating the healing response. 
Yes it’s loud…. But you choose the amount of energy you put into the patient.  The pain does not get better worse before it gets better as someone else said.  Most of my patients have a 70-80% pain relief in one visit.  
This has completely changed how I operate my clinic.

> **Response 2:** Not worth the money.  Poor research to support improvement on anything except plantar fasciitis.  
Pain increases before it decreases.  In my research I’ve found that you Can’t use on joint replacement because it can loosen the prosthesis. Also can make a partial tears worse.  It’s loud. Often patients can tolerate what’s considered the ‘therapeutic dose’

I’m in the very very early stages of starting my own practice. A friend (think a little more than acquaintance) asked me to see her kiddo. We’ve had a couple of phone calls with mom debating if the kiddo needed to be seen. A few weeks later and I’m scheduled to see them Thursday. Mom mentioned that she wants to pay me to do this informal assessment. 

So here is the question: do I charge full price or provide a friend discount, especially considering I am JUST leaving my current job and going out on my own. No standardized tests etc. 

Thank you for any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’d provide discount and ask if she’s pleased, if she would do a Google review, refer friends, etc.

> **Response 2:** You value yourself by the price you charge. Also, when people PAY, they PAY ATTENTION. During the height of C-vd I was giving away advice to friends who were pregnant and realized I resented them bc they weren't following through on my advice... but they had no investment so where was the incentive? Value yourself, and that yes you can help them. We teach people how to treat us and this is no different.

Has anyone done PT record reviews for an attorney for a legal case? What do you charge per hour? An ortho surgeon friend of mine referred me to a lawyer he does reviews for and the lawyer is asking me what my fee schedule is, I have no idea!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would personally charge whatever your hourly cash rate is.  Time is time regardless of what you're doing.

> **Response 2:** What I do is have a rate for the 1st 4 hours of document review with a 4 hour minimum I receive a check in advance for the initial review. 
2) 2nd rate for remaining review of documents, written report 3) 3rd rate - 1/2 day deposition rate
8hr day deposition 

4) 4th rate trial testimony. 
(1/2 day rate and full day rate)
All of this should be in an  email entitled legal fee.  I ask the attorney to return signed legal fee letter

I am seeking clarification on requirements for mobile physical therapy providers. We have been experiencing a surge in requests from patients seeking home therapy for family members who cannot visit our clinic, with 2-3 requests per day. What specific requirements must we meet to provide home-based services under Medicare and commercial insurance, beyond designating the place of service? Are there particular rules we must follow? Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We do this. Change the place of service. From Office 11 to Home 12. Congratulations!!!

*For anyone that started as a mobile side hustle*

1. Did you purchase an EMR at the beginning? Wondering if I should prior to seeing my first patient.

2. What marketing seemed to work best at the beginning? I have a website that I plan on linking (via QR code) to business cards but interested in learning what YOU did to help you get started. My plan is to post on several local FB groups but I’m willing to do anything. I assumed it’d be smarter to wait on Google ads/FB ads/etc until after I get a few established patients/reviews.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got Jane app before patients. I wanted scheduling, payment, reminders, intake, etc through one platform and I felt like it looked more legit. They have a helper discount if you’re under 10 patients a month

> **Response 2:** I built a google sheet EMR and then sold it lol so no you deff don’t need one. They’re honestly built for billing insurances and that’s it

As far as marketing - Shake hands and kiss babies. Nothing beats just shaking hands and kissing babies lol (networking)

**Original Post:**
I am an OT and I am interested in starting a cash-based wellness business for adults (mostly 50+ based on demographics where I am). Not interested in dealing with insurance at all - so strictly focusing on wellness. Several years ago I had my own, small private mobile OT business and I am having trouble shifting my mindset! 🤯

💡 Would love to hear about other wellness based businesses - what services/programs do you offer? 
📚 How do you highlight your OT/PT skills and knowledge while clearly indicating that you are not providing that skilled therapy? 

Example I encountered just in conversation about starting to see clients privately -  someone who is about 3 months post-stroke w lingering hemiparesis, living home independently.   This person would certainly benefit from skilled services  (postural alignment, quality of movement, strength)- how to you draw the line and what would make your services “wellness” vs OT/PT. 
… I can 100% agree with an argument that a very knowledgeable personal trainer could provide appropriate exercise for this patient. BUT - as a licensed OT, would I be crossing a line?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is basically what my business is. I’m a PT, and my take on wellness is a) if someone could learn what I’m teaching in a weekend, it’s not skilled and therefore not PT, and b) if there’s no specific diagnosis that I’m working on it’s not PT. 

I like to say I’m doing personal training with a PTs eyes.

> **Response 2:** Think of recreation vs necessity. Medicare doesn't care if people can golf, play pickleball, etc for example. They want function: just get to the toilet, don't fall, etc. Your client wants to do more than basic function, so make it clear that in your practice that= wellness. Also clearly state on your website that you do not take insurance and that your "wellness" work is  to make the enjoyment of life better. Hope that helps. I struggled here too, but now am good with thinking wellness is anything over basic function. Good luck in the new practice.

My grandma had these XR taken after a FOOSH injury. Doc wants to go to PT to strengthen and strengthen the shoulder 🙄. I see a humeral head dislocation inferiorly and AC jt separation. Anything else? Thoughts?

Update: 10/10 pain with shoulder flexion or abduction. Minimal to no pain when in sling.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am sorry to hear about your grandma. I agree with Ethan other factors to consider. Her health mostly. 

But you can do stages of recovery. Such as sling for 4-6 weeks and isometric exercises etc and after send her back to Ortho for another imaging. I hope there is no fracture though.

> **Response 2:** Just my thoughts… 

Conservative treatment may be the right option. If it’s not dislocated but instead lax due to soft tissue injury which seems very possible since those appear to be taken in standing, then there’s a strong likelihood for cuff tear. What’s the shoulders position in supine? Is your grandma able to be mobilized to assess laxity? If the deformity on xray is related to laxity then what other options does she have? At 80 cuff repair does not typically have great outcomes. Reverse TSA may fit but that’s a long rehab and likelihood she would be able to remain independent throughout the majority of it are really slim. If PT can manage pain and provide some stability to the shoulder so that it’s functional for her it’s potentially a win win.

Any recommendations for CEUs you loved? I am transitioning into more sports rehab, but anything outpatient orthopedic that you loved would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are transitioning into the sports world I would recommend Champion Performance Specialist by Mike Reinold.

> **Response 2:** Has anyone done the myofascial decompression courses? I have been looking at attending one and wanted to hear some feedback. I already do dry needling so would love to have more education and training with cupping

Looking into having personalized scrubs made.  For those with DPT do you put  
Dr. (Name) PT,DPT or just (Name) PT,DPT  

Anyone ordered online for this or did you use a local company? Love some recommendations.  Font size?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I worked hard for my doctorate, and am proud of the title, so I use Dr (name) PT, DPT. I see personalized scrubs, white coats, etc with both though. A lot of companies will embroider for a small fee when ordering.

> **Response 2:** I have always liked having name, and underneath Doctor of Physical Therapy.  Makes it clear.

LET'S GOOOOOO!!! 🏋️

**So many** of my clients just need to get moving, and have someone hold their hand and guide them around the barrier to doing that.

And, I need a little hand-holding myself in order to be a better guide and coach to the people I serve. 🙃

Pumped to go through this course Joe Camoratto and CJ DePalma put together.

**Community Responses:**

1. Best pelvic floor certification course?

2. Best TMJ certification course?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** APTA Orthopedic Section had a monograph on TMJ that is super comprehensive. Has all the info you should need to properly treat it- and my fallback to fill in the cracks is usually medbridge. 

Also I’ve done pelvic floor level 1 through APTA and Herman Wallace- Herman wallace was the best. Hands down! APTA course was - well, lacking. Herman and Wallace was more applicable with the same amount of evidence. APTA felt like they just threw out a bunch of evidence and left you to self discover a lot of the application aspects.

> **Response 2:** Herman and Wallace for pelvic floor

Anyone have advice on how/where I could get CST certified (cranial sacral therapy) i am an IBCLC (lactation consultant) and see so many babies that need a little bit of tension relief. I would Lito be able to do it while i am seeing them instead of them having to wait weeks to be seen. Or at least get a better idea if they need to see chiro or not.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go with Upledger. I took their 1st peds course in the 90's. I've used it on babies ever since. It's like magic on the tiny ones. I think you may have to take the intro course 1st so you learn how to feel the CST rhythm before you try to feel it on a baby. But not sure if that's still the case

> **Response 2:** I’m a pediatric/neuro PT and am trained in CST through Uplegder. There is also a massage therapist named Lori Henderickson who does classes on infant CST. I think her class is good, but you need to know the foundational CST concepts first. She just talks about her infant specific protocol without going over a lot of the foundational anatomy and physiology.

Currently sitting in my "morning office" before I migrate up to my "productive office" (dress code is knit booties)

Hanging out in this group over the last few months, I've noticed a big trend:

A lot of you spend tons of **time, energy and money on patient acquisition** on the front end and then basically do next to nothing for them when they are done with care.

Sure there are some folks to "never discharge", but how can we turn an industry inside joke into a way to make **more money, in less time?**

You're going to love the webinar I put together all about my specialty: remote, subscription based wellness programs.

Can a mobile provider offer multiple services (OT, PT,ST) without being considered a home health agency? 

I’ve been a mobile provider providing services in TX for over 2 years now taking both commercial and medicaid insurance. I am wanting to expand but I do not want to go down the route of being classified as a home health agency. Does anyway have any advice or laws about this specific to Texas. 

I appreciate any input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. Why not. We provide all 3 services both for mobile and our clinics. Good luck!!!!

> **Response 2:** Accidentally becoming a HH agency is not a thing. Becoming one is a very long and arduous process. Totally different ballgame than mobile outpatient. Grow without fear! 😊

8 months of thinking (and researching, planning, seeking advice, and praying) is FINALLY turning into action. So stay tuned for lots of random questions! 😉…Here is the first one:
I’m almost done with my website for mobile cash only practice.  I’ve looked at several of your websites and notice almost nobody mentions  not being able to take Medicare for medically necessary services.  Is there a reason?…is it just a conversation you plan to have during that first phone call?  Just not sure how much detail to include up front..Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That's bc I treat medicare patients with no affiliation. Medicare law does not supercede a client's right to choose their medical provider

**Community Responses:**

Looking for advice from anyone here that has or is currently renting space inside a gym. 
I’m working on writing up a contract with a local gymnastics gym after treating some of their athletes. Gym is about 30,000 sq ft with about 500 members and 20 coaches. There’s no private space/office so I’d be setup either near the weights or in an open mat area with roughly 100-150 sq ft. It’s very flexible and seems like I can make what I want of it, so thinking of starting at 1-2 days per week for 4-6 hours and see how things evolve. Not sure if a daily, weekly, or monthly rent makes most sense to start with. Would love any insight or things to consider from those who have done something similar, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I started out inside of a gym I started with an hourly rate with a cap to convert to monthly once I hit a certain caseload. That way I could scale the rent as I grew. Happy to share more details if you want to PM me

If yes … what’s the range you keep for cash pay …

Anyone offer a stretch lab kind of a service. We are planning to introduce something similar in our clinic. I would like to learn more. Do we need any special certifications? Our clientele is patients with neurologic deficits.
Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Shouldn’t be any other certs needed… I mean, you are a PT. 

We’ve not pulled the trigger yet on doing this, but I do recommend going to a few Stretch Lab, Stretch Zone, Stretch MD sessions first.  See what they really do. 

I did. Booked the free one. Bought a package. Went and enjoyed. Pay close attention to how they do it. Figure out how you could do it better.  Figure out how you can spend 25min hands on, without stopping and giving the client an exercise to do on their own. I actually gave the stretch practitioner feedback for hand placement… they were doing good but needed some refinement. 

Actually liked it enough that I looked into buying a franchise, but had my reasons and ended up not doing it. It truly wasn’t that expensive. 

BUT one of the things….

Each visit is going to cost you b/w $30-$50 (package vs pay per visit). Great. That isn’t bad. 

But on the other end, that person is going to come to you and pay you $30 to $50. Which is a copay. Which kind of sucks. 

Now…I know this is an uncaged thing… if you bill their insurance because they’re coming to you for a back or neck issue… we’re talking much different money. A 23-25 minute stretch session billed as Neuro ReEd AND get the copay. 

So you market it this way….”why go to a stretchy place and get stretched by a guy who spent a weekend in Lauderdale learning how to do this, when you can come to me —who did 8 years of school learning it— AND I can give you a couple of exercises to do at home as well. And if the stretching isn’t just exactly what you need…I can get more in depth. Maybe some dry needles. Maybe a quick crack. maybe a couple of strengthening things as well.”

> **Response 2:** Somebody has to say it, so I'll be that guy. I would hope we would use our education as PTs to rid the world of this nonsense. Neat for a feel-good treatment, but not for people seeking an evidence-based answer to their pain. I get that there's a market for it and money to be made, but it feels cheap to me and is harmful to the identity of our profession. If anyone is out there providing stand alone stretching as a service, they better not be asking why people don't understand what PTs do and what our education level is.

I started my solo practice on the side in April, just cash-based, and finally made the leap to leave my full time gig.  I opted to start taking BCBS, as a number of my patients wanted to follow me and didn’t feel they could afford the self-pay rates. I felt good about keeping it simple with just one insurer, and decided to use MedLife to do my credentialing (they were great!) and billing.  The billing portion has proven difficult here at the beginning, to say the least. 
Main question: they are saying I need to sign up for claimMd as well. Isn’t that redundant?  
Also, where did you all learn about the whole process??  I knew I was spoiled not needing to do more than CPT and billing codes throughout my career, but I am resourceful and it’s seeming ridiculous I can’t get a clear explanation anywhere about the process. TIA!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You need a clearinghouse to send your claims to, who then sends them onto the insurers essentially. We use claimMD with Jane and do billing in house (also INN with BCBS). It’s not hard to do yourself once you get the hang of it. Jane has GREAT modules and is super helpful if you need to call and talk to someone.

> **Response 2:** “I didn’t feel they could afford the self pay rates”… is a limiting belief and an assumption. 

Every consumer is buying more and more goods these days from Amazon, Walmart, Costco, BJs etc etc. Most people are spenders and buy whatever they deem valuable.

So what’s everyone’s experience with UHC needing auth as an out of network? Anyone with existing patients?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I've been advised it's not required for OON

> **Response 2:** I got a bunch of letters from UHC requiring auth some* plans then a month later it's most plans starting September 1. I'm getting out of the MA plans and commercial products going as OON, keeping only the VA community plans. Now this? Just going to start handing out super bills

I saw a patient who has Medicare just over a year ago for general strengthening. I have no relationship with Medicare and told them that Medicare won’t reimburse. Well I just got a call from her son asking if I can help him submit to Medicare. What do I say to gracefully get out of this? 
I am also worried about Medicare even getting wind of it because it was likely medically necessary, she just refused to see her primary doctor to get set up with home health and she and her family were insistent on getting some strengthening.

Edit/update: I realized that this son wasn’t there for the initial conversation I had with the patient and their family. I sent a message explaining the situation. He took it very well and was understanding. Thanks everyone!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Confused on the HH piece? She would not need home health? She could just see an output therapist in home under med B ?

> **Response 2:** Did they sign anything acknowledging that they understand you don’t have a relationship with Medicare and that your services would not be reimbursable? ￼

UPDATE: 

Just found out the payer has been sending payment to another PT group because the practitioner’s NPI is associated with that group as well (she works there prn). Has anyone encountered this?  I am at a loss for how to fix this.  

———————

One of our cash-pay clients has been submitting self-claims for reimbursement.  His insurance is BCBS Federal.  He has yet to receive any reimbursement.  Today he was told by his insurance company that "because the NPI is on the superbill, payment was sent to the PT practice..." (it wasn't); and, "the PT practice will need to reimburse you for these funds and there's nothing else we can do for you."  Basically, they have told him (falsely) that we, the PT group, have been receiving reimbursement for his already-paid-for cash services.  Except we haven't received a dime!  It's so ridiculous that I don't know who to call in order to straighten it out.  Plus, I don't have time to be on the phone arguing this as a solo practitioner / owner.  Has anyone else dealt with this?  Honestly, every self-claim attempt my patients have made, regardless of payer, has led to some level of headache and frustration for both the patient, and for me.  It's maddening.  Any advice appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m fighting to get enrolled because my npi is associated with other clinics for the same reason and it’s a nightmare. Idk what to do!

> **Response 2:** Yes it’s maddening. I’ve been chasing payments from tufts for six months for three of my therapists

I am starting the process of re-investigating medical insurance for myself. I am an LLC with one employee about to be 2… I am changing my status to employee. For the past four years I have paid a reasonable premium for a UHC policy through multiple companies. I find it confusing. The issue is that it’s geared for having no problems and last year I spent probably 10k on out of pocket things that weren’t covered (not covered things that really weren’t illness) I’m realizing that it would be better to spend more on the front end since it would be a business deduction and the out of pocket expenses are not. What are some of you doing for medical?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Christian Healthcare Ministry is a healthshare and it's what we use but you will still pay for most health costs. I also recommend an HSA card for lower tax burden. You can Google which cards are best.

> **Response 2:** I’ve been in business for 12 years and insurance for small business sucks across-the-board. However, one of the few good things that the APTA has done is offer large group coverage for small business of eight or 10 employees or less. I think it’s on the website, I signed up for it and I’m only paying about $60 more a month for my plan starting in August but now I have no deductible, I have no coinsurance. I had a $10,000 deductible before and had to pay for everything out-of-pocket every year. ￼

I started my mobile PT business with just me, I have done all the billing, schedule, marketing, insurance verification, treatments,.etc myself. I have grown fast where I can't keep up with referrals and have finally started hiring PTs to provide services. I want to stay on the business side of things but don't want to do the social media aspect of marketing. I want to start looking for someone to keep up with social media, my question is how do you pay someone? Do you pay by the hour, the post...any feedback is greatly appreciated. I feel like my biggest limitation in running a business is being unsure how to pay people for different aspects. As a PT, I get paying PTs 😊 but there's so many business components?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Literally why I switched to using StrataPT. It's a comprehensive all in one emr and billing system that specially has a mobile practice set up. So I wear less business hats and spend less time with verification, denials, etc and more time treating or relaxing.

> **Response 2:** Not to jump on here but could I ask message you about how you started your business??

What characteristics or actions do you see in common with your most successful students?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 1) Belief. When we don’t have to spend time building belief that this will work, and belief in themselves that they can do this, then success comes more quickly.

2) Good communication skills. A huge part of growing your business has to do with clearly and passionately conveying your mission to others in the community. 

3) Confident with selling themself. This usually comes from a belief in themselves, that is transferred over into believing that they truly are the best option for their clients.

That’s all I’ve got for now!

> **Response 2:** Authenticity and trustworthiness

Group benefits are given to larger organizations at a discounted rate because there's a larger and more unified voice. 

This is just a small aspect of what we're looking to accomplish with the Uncaged Clinician Community and app. 

We have an audience that other businesses want access to and instead of us just using this audience to get sponsorship and affiliate deals for ourselves, we want to help share those benefits to our community.

What does all this mean and what other benefits are there?

For my mobile providers: do you find yourself constantly messing with your schedule to try and keep drives close together as possible, then you DC someone and get someone new who now lived 20 mins the other way and you’re shuffling things all over (and also feel bad for switching current patient’s times)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely some schedule management. I have 2 different zones, one area M/W, then second area Tues/Thursday that are reasonably close to each other. I do my best to predict, but occasionally ask a patient to slide up or down to avoid zig zagging around town...but I always look a week ahead to prep for that. There are patients that have standing times too. Most are reasonable! I've found I'm able to route decently to be timely, but I do call if I'm more than 5 minutes off.

> **Response 2:** I group and schedule my patients by geographic location. I will even explain this to them during the scheduling process so they understand and none of them have complained at all about it. 

If you think about when you go to the doctor, you just have to take whatever is available. If a patient really wants the service it's not going to make or break you unless of course you only have  an 8:00 a.m. or a 5:00 p.m. or something like that. 

Even with the best laid intentions I have had patients who are 5 minutes away from each other and one has a last-minute doctor appointment and I can't group them together which is frustrating. But it definitely gets easier when you set your boundaries!   

And to make things easier I actually do my schedule only one week at a time. That way I don't waste time moving things around.  Pretty much at the end of their last visit of the week I then go over the schedule for the following week and I put them on. I try to keep their times pretty consistent, just to make scheduling easier.  And I don't allow them to schedule, since I need full control of the calendar based on the geography. 😁

I actually have two patients right now who live in a neighborhood 30-35 minutes away. That is very far for me but they are both cash pay patients. But I made it very clear to them that because of the distance I have to see both of them on the same day. And they both are fine with it!

There is not enough information to provide you with based on your post, on what would be legally required…

If it’s just a landing page generate leads via phone calls, etc.. I wouldn’t worry about all the intricacies as most of this stuff only applies if you’re gathering PHI. 

The rest of the bridges can be crossed if and when an individual become a customer/patient.

Hey, me again lol. Is it necessary to have an LLC, or can I just operate under my license and malpractice insurance? What is the benefit of having an LLC? I am going to work super minimal hours at first, like <10, only cash, I'm the only PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Separation of church and state.   You treat a patient as yourself. They sue you they can come after all of your assets etc.    if you’re a business. Your personal life is kept away from the business. 
It takes 1 hour and maybe a $200 to set up a basic LLC.

> **Response 2:** The LLC protects your personal assets. Without the LLC if there is litigation, your assets could be taken as opposed to the businesses assets. 100% would go with an LLC. Also look for state run financial institutes that certify an LLC- don’t go through legal zoom 😉

As a healthcare provider (PT), am I legally allowed to accept tips from cash pay clients for physical therapy?  How about for "wellness" services?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don’t tell anyone, but I’ve personally never declined a tip 🫣

> **Response 2:** From the APTA code of ethics: “Physical therapists shall not accept gifts or other considerations that influence or give an appearance of influencing their professional judgment.” 

A “tip” may fall under that category but a “gift” may not.  

This doesn’t speak to the legality of it either.  I’d check your states practice act to see if it has any ethical regulations around this.

I have been on my own doing mobile PT for about a year and half now.  It seems like I am either crazy busy or super slow.  Does anyone else experience this? 
I had my biggest/busiest month in July, then slowed down a bit more each week in Aug and last week was my slowest week ever.  
Then, BAM!!  I got 3 new referrals on Friday and 2 more this week.  Now I am swamped again.  This roller coaster is going to give me a heart attack?!?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I experienced that ALL. THE. TIME.

> **Response 2:** I’ve been lucky to not have any real lows yet, but the balance of fear of never getting another referral if there is a quiet week vs total overwhelmed trying to sort out where to put everyone is REAL!

I have to give a 10 minute presentation to my BNI group in a month. HAs anyone given one successfully? And if so, what did you cover? TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in BNI and have given 3 presentations so far. The first one was why MRIs aren't reliable in diagnosing back pain. The next one I brought my table and asked for someone with back pain, screened him and fixed all the pain in 10 mins. The last one was on gait deviations and how I know what is wrong with you based on how you walk. It was a fun to demonstrate different patterns.

> **Response 2:** Yes I've given bni presentations. Talking about how you can help the clients of other members and your specialty is best. Personally I left those grps.

So I interviewed for a position at a facility that will be opening in June.  This was back in February. It is a business man who son is in PT school and wanted to start a practice for him. They wanted a therapist to help get practice going as well as cont to work. As they were going through the process they told me in order to open it on time the practice needed to be owned by a PT in NJ. So they said if I wanted to they could put my name on the LLC and transfer it to the son once he passes his boards. We are still waiting for attorney to do all the paperwork work but wanted some idea if this was an issue. I’ll be paid salary vs 1099   We have an EMR amd equipment. Need to start marketing to physicians in area. As of now not a lot of PT places in area. It’s will be Medicare amd OON only. Any specific questions I should be asking g or looking for in this paper work

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** why are yall worried about lawsuits ??

> **Response 2:** If you own it. You have the liability.  
In order for you to sell it to him money should likely exchange hands of sorts. 

After all they are truly renting your license and you should see it as such. 
If not a sale I would be asking for an ownership portion and get some of that equity. 

Many business people focus on profits and not patient care etc.  be mindful of that. 

This father likely sees $$$ 

Either way you need a good exit package plan in place.  

If it’s a no from them it should also be a no from you.

Need some advice:
I have a mobile PT business where I see patients for self pay or through Med Part B.
Had a Chiropractor, who is an aquatence of my husband, ask to set up a deal with me to come into his office to see, primarily, Medicare patients bc he isn't a Medicare provider (he says he has tons of patients to give me...). He was talking about partnering together or me paying him part of the profit or rent. I really dont know what to say. I dont want to blow off a potential business deal/connection but not sure the legal aspect or how we'd bill (through my mobile company or his brick and mortar) This is all new to me as I have only been doing this a little over 1 year (but have been a PT for 14 and a manager of clinic for 12 of those years). Anyone who made similar partnerships or business deals can lead me in the right direction or give advice? I am in FL if that helps.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would question “partnering” in every sense of the word. I would treat it like you are renting a room or a space and keep your own business private. Paying rent is legal, giving him part of that is not. ￼

> **Response 2:** Paying him a piece of the profit is a kick back and is illegal!  He wants to pump up his Medicare revenue using you.

Food for thought. 

You get home from work and realize you are locked out of your house. You call a locksmith. They come out and within three minutes. You are inside. They charge you $100. 

￼ same scenario ..it takes them 30 minutes to get you inside your house. They charge you $100. Which scenario do you like better? 

The average person will pay 50% more to wait 50% less   🫠💯✅￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The problem with these comparisons is that forever, we as therapists are in a health care system that has paid for services with insurance. 
Trainers and acupuncturists and massage therapists have never been part of the insurance system. It will take a long time and much persistence and change for us to be seen differently….people pay a lot for their insurance every month and want to use it when they can. It’s a tough position to be in but it’s where we are as therapists.

> **Response 2:** Also, an average locksmith should get you in the house in 1 visit. Even great PT will/should often take multiple visits for the problem to truly be solved.

Please share what and how much $$$

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 2:** I pay $100 for Jane EMR (I’m grandfathered in to a lower rate but it’s not too much more than that I think) $11 for srfax, $45 for Claim MD clearing house to bill insurance. Everything I need to document, schedule and bill patients/insurance is included in that.

Just became a licensed health and life insurance agent in my state. It’s now very clear why insurance companies act the way they do. They MUST pay a claim in a very short time frame …. However… there is no legislation on taking the money BACK!!!!!!! They know they don’t want to be turned in to the state insurance director…. So they pay… legislation needs to be written on the other side of that fence. #MyNextProject

I have a question about OON billing...I apologize for the length of the post but I am incredibly frustrated and I would greatly appreciate any advice!

I've been billing OON with EmblemHealth and UnitedHealthcare for 2 different patients. EmblemHealth began denying all claims after patient met their OON deductible (how convenient...). I've called several times, long story short it's been a mess, they say it was all an error on their end(denied stating I already billed for those services that day which just is not correct and they acknowledge that), and they keep just resubmitting them for review, they get the same error, and repeat. It is significantly delaying payment to me.

For UnitedHealthcare, I had to get prior authorization with Optum physical health through this "Voluntary Prior Approval" process. I took the time to do that (a lot of time since they approve 1-4 visits at a time) and I was told I wouldn't have to submit medical records. I submitted claims for all of the appointments that were approved with the approval number. They only approved 2 claims (sent both checks to the patient even though they told me if they assign benefits to me and I accept assignment it would go to me, both are not cashed and the patient says she never received them.). UHC denied one of the claims stating they asked for medical records and I didnt respond so it is denied. The other 5 were sent to Optum Insight for review and they are still processing until they recieve medical records from me. I never recieved any letters asking for documentation. I call and they say oh it looks like a completely different provider info is on the claims and sent to X address (which isnt mine), someone really messed something up here. However, on the patient's portal my name and NPI are associated with all of the claims...They essentially said they can't do anything about it, I have to wait until they are denied within 30 days of not receiving records (some are past that timeframe already!), then resubmit the claims and hope they dont screw it up again...this is completely unacceptable.

Is this something to bring up to the State department? UHC owes me $9100 and Emblem hasn't paid anything since May...Safe to say I am only giving superbills from now on...it doesn't matter how large their fee schedule is if they will not pay you and require as much admin work as in network!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** yep.  send it all to your state insurance commissioner.  this has got to end.  noone should have to spend thatch time and waste just to get paid an amount they already approved.

> **Response 2:** Wow that is awful it is my biggest fear of seeing patients in general and dealing with insurance. I'd like to hear input on this as well!

Hello guys! What are your tax strategies to lower your taxes for mobile therapist and having an LLC? Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Best thing is keeping track of mileage!

> **Response 2:** Hey! A few things that help, track all your work expenses (mileage, gear, CEUs, software, etc.), look into the home office deduction if you do admin at home, and consider a Solo 401(k) or SEP IRA to lower taxable income. If you're making good money, switching your LLC to an S-Corp can also save on taxes. Def worth talking to a tax pro who gets the mobile therapy world!

Does anyone have recommendations/advice on how to do better marketing? Specifically via social media/Instagram to gain folllowers?  I now have online fitness programs up on Everfit app and trying to find ideas on how to better market the programs and gain clients.  Marketing to my womens mountain bike club of 3,500+ ladies hasn’t been enough so far.  😒

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Be consistent, pool your audience to know what they want to know, create content around what they want to know and not what you think they want to know, be consistent and post daily.

> **Response 2:** Don’t overcomplicate it. Just provide value. Post simple videos or text posts answering a common question or issue your clients run into. Do NOT get caught into the trap of trying over explain yourself in your caption (we all do it). Because then it will take you like 45 minutes to make 1 post. Keep things as simple as you can and try to make each post just 1 main thing you are trying to get across. Don’t worry about editing posts or anything. Just post. Show your personality (people work with people they like). See what works and what doesn’t. Go from there. 

Why would somebody want your program? What are they going to get out of it? And I don’t mean “get stronger, more fit, etc etc” because every program ever says that. What actual problem will your program help solve for mountain bikers? What are the things people complain about most often? Stay on the bike longer? No longer need long rest breaks once you get to the top? 

Don’t try to just post stuff on the mountain biking group to market, just be in there a lot and answer questions and show them you are knowledgeable and eventually people will reach out to you. 

Think of social media marketing as farming. Just keep planting seeds, and then eventually you’ll be able to harvest them.

Anyone has had issues with Google reviews not showing up?  My patient left a review last week and it didn't show up.  Anyone has found out why?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So weird. I’ve had that happen too. May have something to do with if you as an owner don’t register using a gmail. My domain is my company name and I’ve had some issues

> **Response 2:** Email support.

Pro tip: if you want reviews which make even a better difference ask the reviewer to post a picture and or use some keywords for your services. 

Also if you’re solely a mobile therapist don’t register an address, use a service area.

Hi all.  I'm doing my first vendor event in late April.  It is a street festival, and most of the vendors will be selling food or crafts.

I am a sports/ortho PT (cash-based, no Medicare) and would like to focus on the role of PT in wellness and injury prevention.  My first thought had been to do an injury risk screen, similar to one that I offer once a month at my practice.  I use a self screen, but with the space I have for the event 10x10) can probably only do 2 at a time.

So questions to those who have done outdoor vendor events:

1. What ideas have you used that worked well in getting people to stop at your tent/table?

2. What ideas do you have to turn these leads into clients, preferably ways to collect emails or phone numbers for marketing?  Some thoughts I had were ebook sign-ups, raffle for free session.

3. Is it worth it to have giveaway items, and if so, what did you use?

Thanks in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have events planned for late fall; a 5k and a gravel bike ride.  I plan on doing IASTM and cupping on a portable treatment table while advertising running analysis and bike fitting.  I might try to hand out some chocolate milk for the runners.

> **Response 2:** what about giving away 15-minute personal screens for people to come see you. Usually a screen will land you some patients. And, if they don't take advantage of it, it didn't really cost you much.

Anybody else out there struggling to get new patients? I came out with a bang, but now I haven't had a new patient in months. I had a few evals, but they didn't want to return for follow-ups (I think mainly due to schedule, not anything I did or didn't do, unless they don't want to tell me that). I have done paid ads on facebook, where I get a few messages but never turns into anything. I have done a few workshops and have some coming up in January, but my goal was 15 visits a week, and currently I am at 4, with nothing promising on the horizon.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This time of year is notoriously slow. Our business is often feast or famine. If you are seeing Medicare patients, should be an uptick in referrals after the first of the year. Marketing is everything though. Best wishes!

> **Response 2:** I'm in the same space. It's extremely anxiety inducing. I'm just going to be focused on marketing and making appointments with physicians and their referral schedulers ..

My aunt has some notably arched feet from her cerebral palsy. We have been trying so hard to find her "princess shoes" that might stay on her feet, but we keep striking out. Anyone have any suggestions?

Side note: she spends most of her time seated (wheelchair or otherwise), so we don't have to worry about her having to walk in them.

Hey guys! Quick question. Is emailing my previous patients from my old corporate job about my new cash paying PT business unethical or a hippa violation? I have about 8 to 10 patients that I happen to have their email addresses from some internal reviews they posted within the company. They posted about me and I wasn’t sure how to proceed because I had a good relationship with them and I would like to let them know where I am now, but I also don’t want to violate anything by sending them an email. Please advise 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would not. It could be construed as a HIPAA violation as to how you got their personal information outside of work

> **Response 2:** It could be viewed as “unethical” from a business perspective and your former employer could take legal action for “poaching” and soliciting their patients  even if you directly were treating them  Technically and legally it is their patients - not yours. This does not include if you also signed any NDA ,  Non-compete is the least of your worries and does not really apply here depending on your state laws. 

It does violate certain HIPAA practice standards since you should not even have their email addresses those should have been discarded upon leaving your former employer - much less attempt to contact them.

There is “freedom of choice” so if the patients do not want to continue with their current provider and decide to seek you out on their own without being influenced from outside sources, then there is nothing your employer can do and your golden.

My friend was just named in a lawsuit among other therapists at a SNF. She doesn’t work there anymore and is out of state. She doesn’t know what the lawsuit is for yet. Her former coworkers got served in person. She doesn’t know what to expect or what to do. Does anyone have experience with this or advice? I told her to consult with her liability insurance but she asked me to check with other therapists. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I was named in a lawsuit while working at a SNF.  A patient who spoke sign language sued over not having enough time per day with an interpreter present.  I never actually understood why I was named in it.  We were represented by the company’s attorneys.  I did have to do a deposition which was a terrible experience but the case ended up being dropped.

> **Response 2:** Remember during a deposition- only answer the questions they ask (do not expand).  And pause before answering to give your attorney a chance to object.

Instead of mobile outpatient PT can we be a home health business owner/PT? Reimbursement is higher this way…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The reimbursement is higher but the start up and operations cost id also exponentially higher. And a ton of regulations by the state and conditions of participation by CMS.

> **Response 2:** Having done both and having my own solo practice but never having any experience managing home health I would think that there are a lot more home health guidelines that need to be followed as well as having to supply or contract with all of the disciplines. You also need to think about the area you want to cover. 
I know the reimbursement is higher it probably also requires a lot more manpower to run

I need opinions please! I’m struggling with the name of my business. My legal name is Gabbert Clinic PLLC and I have a DBA Gabbert Hand Therapy. I like the way it sounds but am worried about the possible future pitfalls of using my name (what if I wanted to sell it one day?). So other ideas I have:

1) ActionArm Hand Therapy
2) Action (Hand & Upper Extremity Rehab)
3) Action Hand Rehab
4) Columbia Hand Therapy (name of large river near us)
5) Hand Rehab of Vancouver 
6) StrongArm Hand Therapy
7) stick with my name

Thank you!!!!!

New Hampshire therapists! My best friend in the whole world is going through a barrage of neurological tests to determine the cause of a variety of symptoms. She reached out to me to get recommendations and I’m looking for your help to get her good therapists. 

She is looking for PT for dizziness/balance/gait instability, OT for cognitive impairments, and SLP because her neurologist recommended it. I know finding these in NH is tough, but she has great state insurance that she needs to use and is willing to put in the work. She’s a 41 year old mom of 3 and is having a LOT of major issues. She lives in the Lakes Region but knows she will have to travel. Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

For all the solo mobile practices out there, how do you handle time out of the office greater than a week? I’m going to be out of the area for 2 weeks. Do you bring in another PT to help out as an independent contractor? Do your clients simply wait until you return? Would love to hear what you all do.  Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We left and closed the clinic for 3 weeks last year, no issues. We made sure patients had extensive HEP activities and stressed compliance. I was available via email in case of questions or concerns. No declines while I was gone, but it did take a bit of prep prior. Outpatient neuro.

> **Response 2:** I let them know ahead of time and review any questions of their HEP. Seemed to work out well for me, surprisingly many are happy that I actually take time off. For those who have been coming for a while we sometimes use it as a test to see how they do on their own.

**Community Responses:**

Also, is it a charity race?  (I know - seems like a weird question but it makes a difference in why people are coming to your booth - ie to get free stuff versus learning about your services)

This question is for all the lymphedema therapists treating Medicare patients...I had a contractor tell me yesterday her hospital-based outpatient PRN job stated Medicare will only pay 1-3 visits for bandaging now. Compression bandaging (Short Stretch) is consider not skilled after 3 visits by Medicare. What??? Anyone have experience with this?  I have not received any denials but I would love to avoid them if possible.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Bandaging has never been considered skilled.  Patient education/caregiver training.

I have owned my own LLC since February and am currently still working part time at an OP clinic. At the OP clinic, we do not have a receptionist and it falls on the therapists to answer phones, schedule patients, do patient intake, open up the clinic, etc. Since opening my own business and reducing my hours, my boss has been criticizing me for clocking in 10-15 minutes early to do the tasks above. My thinking is that this is the cost of not having a receptionist and I can’t be expected to do these tasks for free. Any insight would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think your boss needs to consider who is supposed to be paid to open the clinic 15 min early so clients dont' arrive to a locked door. If they want someone else to do it they can schedule them and let you know that you shouldn't. If they want you to do it, you can't legally work off the clock.

> **Response 2:** I totally agree you should be paid for those extra tasks. I would have a convo with the boss and say you wouldn’t mind helping out but will be paid for that time or else you will be arriving right as the session starts and leaving we soon as it is over.

Question for PTs that offer in person strength training - are your prices the same for that as for a PT session? Assuming the time of the session is the same.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. I have offered to do groups of high school up 3 kiddos and they just split the cost of the time rate. For adults, I still charge the rate for cash PT for my time.

> **Response 2:** Same price for all the reasons above, plus… if you start out charging a lower rate for personal training and then the client needs more of a physical therapy visit… It’s hard to go up on the price. ￼

Hi all!  I’m currently running a cash based practice and considering credentialling with Medicare.   For those of you that have done so (preferably in the Virginia area) can you give me some insight into your reimbursement rates?  I can look up the fee schedule online but I realize this just gives me base numbers for each CPT code and that there are a lot of variables to this.  Trying to decide if it’s worth the hassle or not!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** AOTA has a calculator in their site that will take the deduction into account. I would use that if you are an OT. https://www.aota.org/practice/practice-essentials/coding/medicare-fee-schedule-calculator I suspect that APTA has the same for PT.

> **Response 2:** I just took the leap and did it this spring. I’m in MD, but I believe VA uses the same MAC (don’t quote me on that.) I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn’t as much of a hassle as I expected. I was credentialed very quickly, and the people at Novitas were very pleasant and helpful. My EMR takes care of all the submissions of claims and accounting without increasing my rate because I’m a solo practice and they are a small company. My business has doubled in revenue because I’m getting double what I was taking for “non-skilled wellness” visits. I don’t get what I get for cash clients, but it’s a reliable stream of income at about 80% of what my cash rate is, which is still great.

As a hybrid physical therapist in Texas, I am currently contracted with Medicare and BCBSTX, which provide decent compensation. My remaining visits are cash-based. I am interested in learning if other members here accept additional insurance plans that offer competitive reimbursement rates (approximately $100) and have fewer administrative hurdles. I aim to continue growing my practice while ensuring its financial sustainability.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would definitely go with tricare. Do not go with cigna

> **Response 2:** I’m very similar to you in that I initially ￼started with Medicare and Blue Cross. I added TRICARE about a year ago and they are similar in payment to Medicare and Blue Cross.

What are the cons of becoming in network with insurance? It seems like insurance reimbursement rates are quite high compared to cash rates per hour. 

Is it simply not worth it to become in network because of the authorizations, paper work, delayed payment, etc? Please help me understand why more clinicians are not working privately but also in-network as opposed to only cash based?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cons of working with insurance - you have to work with insurance. 
Have you never had to call an insurance company and beg for another 10 visits for your stroke patient but they only give you 4 because insurance doesn't know the difference between an ankle sprain and a CVA ?

> **Response 2:** I’m so lost. Where are you seeing high reimbursement rates??

Which EMR system do you recommend?

Hoping to find one that takes care of the billing but also open to others as I want to keep it cost effective.
Planning to start up as a mobile PT business that treats patients with Medicare as well as cash patients. 
If you don’t mind saying if your EMR system includes/excludes the billing for you (and goes to bat for you if insurance denies your claim) that would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Next Thursday, the 25th, I’ll be hosting another Community Q&A with JaneApp. Come learn about their product!

> **Response 2:** I used hellonote for about 3 years when I started. It’s a great platform but I felt like I needed more help with billing and revenue/KPI reporting as my company grew. I recently switched to StrataPT - Physical Therapy EMR & Revenue Cycle Management. They don’t charge you for the EMR or per user but they take a percentage of the billing. They do all the billing, follow up on denials and everything. I have a lot of contractors which made companies like prompt way too expensive for me…. With strata, I can add as many contractors as I want, and there is still no actual cost for the EMR, only the percentage for the billing.

Hi everyone, I had a patient send me a denial from her insurance from the superbill I sent her. Just for reference, I am out of network with all insurance companies! 
I took a snap shot of why they said it was denied. Would someone mind sending me what their superbill shows? Maybe I’m missing something? Or maybe it’s saying I’m out of network? Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe if you make an NPI for your business that would match things as your NPI is likely tied to other jobs.

> **Response 2:** If I may piggyback on this topic. I am in Louisiana and have decided to offer a superbill for patients to submit. I have offered in the past but nobody wanted it. I am making a big push to increase business to completely “uncage” and want to add that option. Anyone in LA with experience in cash clinic have some advice?

What was your best marketing strategy to date? What has yielded the best return on investment?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Talking to everyone I know, telling my friends and family what I am doing and they have marketed for me. It has just grown by word of mouth from there and I now keep a full schedule.

> **Response 2:** From what I’ve seen/heard from mobile/private practice it’s referrals from happy clients. 

Get super clear on who you’d like to serve and become the “go-to person” for that. Don’t spray and pray with your messaging. 😉 

Also dig into the deeper problems your solving. 

1. Surface level
2. Deeper/intrinsic
3. Societal

1. Knee pain
2. Not being able to care for grandkids without pain
3. Growing older doesn’t mean you have to deal with pain and stop doing the things you love. 

(Just an ortho example of the levels) 😁

There are two ditches on both sides of the road to avoid when growing your business:

Left ditch - "I can figure it out on my own." That is fueled by pride/ego and can get us in trouble. It's always healthiest to stay open to learning at all times. 

Right ditch - Over-consuming all information that you can get your hands on. Many people read books and absorb information that isn't helpful in the stage of business they are in, and steers them away from implementation of the right things. 

The heart of this post comes from hearing many people tell me that they have pre-ordered Alex Hormozi's $100M Leads. Every book he puts out is fantastic, no doubt...BUT here is the question I ask each time: Is that what you NEED to be reading to get you to your next level of growth?

If not, be disciplined enough to pick up the RIGHT book.
So, why is this important?

Because I've literally seen practice owners who REALLY just need to hire another PT, pick up a book like that and get side tracked for MONTHS because they are trying to implement the wrong thing.

That book at the RIGHT time for the RIGHT business, Im sure will be exceptional, but really the PT in the example above just needs to focus on hiring, and learning how to do so properly.

Stay on the road at all costs! Don't get distracted and veer yourself off the road only to realize months later how far you have gone off the road. 

You can do this! This is just my reminder to stay focused and avoid the two ditches.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Comparison is how Satan works in business…especially for believers. He knows we naturally have desires to have more or do more. When we think we need more or something different comparison starts to run our business and gets us off track

Hi all, Looking for reviews of prompt emr specifically .. opening a mobile PT practice focusing on vestibular and neuro clients, cash and Medicare. If anyone has a similar practice and uses prompt your input would be so helpful!.. Did a demo but also looking to hear from actual people who use it too (is it worth the cost). Also, Does anyone also use it for wellness visits/ memberships? Any negatives?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started with HENO with my mobile practice. I looked at prompt and liked it, but the time and cost of moving the data held me back. Prompt is really nice if you are planning on scaling, but for me HENO does everything I need it to do and costs less. I’m happy to share my referral link if interested in HENO.

> **Response 2:** I participate with insurance; In a nutshell- I switched from WebPT to Prompt and switched back to WebPT.  Each system has their pros and cons.  For me, WebPT is very responsive and knows their system and has an IT department and staff that knows their system and can easily figure out things.

Question for those of you who work with athletes:  The parents of my daughter’s select soccer team (11 year olds) want advice on hydration and electrolyte drinks.  I want to make sure I give them the latest research but finding conflicting info, especially regarding when/how much sports drink to consume.  They are about to start boot camp/scrimmages in triple digit Texas heat.  Last season, I think there was an excess of orange Powerade consumption (🤢😉)…What guidance would you give?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would recommend LMNT! Definitely very salty, but it’s the cleanest I have found! I give to my 7 and 14 yr olds who play sports! I water it down…use 1/2 packets in their 32 oz bottles!
Also use Ultima (not as clean, but waaaayyy better than Gatorade/Powerade, etc) and you can get these packers on Amazon and local health food stores! Variety of flavors as well!

> **Response 2:** I don't work with athletes in this capacity, but a Liquid IV packet once or twice a day (and water the rest of the time) works really well. Learned about it from my granddad's cancer battle, when he kept getting dehydrated so easily.

Has anyone discharged a patient who they felt uncomfortable treating? IVe been treating a 20yo young man with pelvic floor issues. I’ve felt uncomfortable with him from session one. Nothing that he is doing per say. There is just something. My sessions are 1-1, in closed door, very personal of course, given the nature of the sessions… and he is not inappropriate, I can’t tell what it is, but there is something that leaves me on edge every session the whole session. Our improvement has also not been great. There is still time for improvement, but usually by this point there are great shifts happening already. And in his case there has been zero changes.
I am continuing because I am the only pelvic floor therapist in my area who will see males, so I feel bad discharging without giving a referral to someone else… but I don’t think I am the therapist who will facilitate the results he needs. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Read the book The Gift of Fear - it’s by a former homicide detective. He points out that female humans are the only mammal that will discount their own internal warning system because they don’t want to make the other human “feel” bad. He makes a great example of a woman about to get on an elevator with a man - the woman’s intuition tells her there’s something off with the guy…. The woman overrides her intuition and gets on the elevator anyways because she doesn’t want the man to think shes’ a… snob, racist, a bit@h, whatever… the author points out that you’ll never see a gazelle get into a closed metal box with a lion - You don’t owe him more than a polite discharge on the next session. You’ve obviously been experiencing these feelings for many sessions - time to honor them.

> **Response 2:** Your intuition is telling you everything you need to know.  Discharge him based on no progress made, and refer him back to his physician.

What are your most creative ways of bringing in supplemental income while getting ready to launch your own business or in the early phases of starting your business?

I'm a mom with 2 small children, so looking for things that can take place in the 6 hours per day they're at school, and or occasional evenings or weekends. Currently working very part time PRN in home health, as I don't necessarily want another PT  job that will suck my time and energy while I'm trying to get my own thing off the ground! 

Or do I just go all in and put all time and energy into getting the business off the ground and running ASAP? 

Thanks for input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m still taking 15 home health visits a week and I have barely any time for my business. I’m the main breadwinner though so it makes me feel like I’m responsible for my family. But I also know my business is suffering 🥲 it’s a hard choice to make!!

> **Response 2:** Honestly, unless you are in an urgent financial need situation…I highly recommend that you go all in fast and hard 100% dedicated and focused on the new business. I have had several successful PT businesses over the years and each time….it was all I did and it flourished. Once I had kids….omg….game changed to be even more challenging.  So if you also have kids ..then definitely only work on this business. And…congratulations!👍

I got a message through my Google listing from a guy claiming to be a tennis instructor. He said he is getting back surgery soon and wants a physical therapist to work with 8 of his athletes in different injuries and wellness stuff. Seemed a little sketchy at first but I was excited about the opportunity. 
He is offering to pay for all 8 athletes in advance. Not sure how it would be a scam as he said he would give me the credit card info to run. I would require him to give it over the phone instead of text. I’m not sure how it’s a scam yet but still sketchy. There are a couple red flags such as him listing a bunch of cities that are spelled wrong and he said he is from a city in Utah that doesn’t exist. His English isn’t great and all of the contacts have email addresses that appear to be a combination of their last and first name. 

Anyways, I’ll keep you posted as I learn more info. 
Anyone have any experience with a situation like this?

Interesting experience at the dentist. My wife and I have been having TMJ issues so during my check up I asked if he had any Physical Therapists that he referred to for TMJ issues. He instead told me about two dentists both of which were very far away one of which he said was extremely expensive.￼ 🤨

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would release the trigger points in the pterygoids to release the jaw. Also be wary of opening your jaw too widely at the dentist, and be conscious of your mental state and gritting your teeth so you can stop doing that.

> **Response 2:** Hi, this is super common. I'm a TMD specialist PT and my husband is actually a general dentist. Dentists only know the teeth unless they've hade advanced CE in treating TMD. Referring you to a dentist who treats it was a smart move, at least they knew to do that. Most dentists have no idea what PT can do for this.

Topic: NPI 1/NPI 2 
 
Hey all! I have a weird situation and I’m not sure if I need actual advice or just need to talk this out and have someone else confirm what I think I know. 

I have my LLC set and plan to get my cash practice up and running in the next few months. I’d like my patients to be able to submit super bills. Need to figure out NPI. 

When I started my first job out of school, I was practicing under some type of group NPI through a large health system. I set up an NPI1 about 7 years ago when I moved out of state, changed jobs, and started working for a place that billed as a private practice. I left that job after 1 year and since then have gone back to working with the original large health system PRN. Never updated any info for my NPI. 

Option 1: Set up an NPI2, do not enroll with Medicare. Update address info on NPI1. Do I need to do anything with NPI1, like unenroll with Medicare? What about other insurance companies that I may have been affiliated with during my 1-yr private practice stint? No idea how to find out that info if needed. 

Option 2: Update my NPI1. From what I’m reading, if you’re an LLC and you’re not incorporated, you can use your NPI1. Still not sure what I have to do with Medicare or previously contracted insurance companies. 

Will any of these changes affect my ability to work PRN for the large healthcare system? As I mentioned, I believe I function under a group NPI (maybe their NPI2?) as I didn’t have my own for the first 3 years of my career. 

Thanks for any insight, shared experiences, or advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** U don't have contracts under your npi if u want medicare u need a new medicare number.  Mostly insurances contract with type 2 group npi.  Ur type 1 npi number should still be good it follows u for life but u have to update on caqh find out ur password and reattest

> **Response 2:** Your NPI is associated with the other clinics you work for but under they group NPI. Anything you do under your business will not be associated with any insurance contracts.

Hi all! New here.
Me and my husband are planning to start a mobile PT business. Our specialty is Neuro PT. 
We are looking for it to be a side hustle vs full time as of now. I plan to be cash based and not accept insurance as of now. (Is that possible??) A few questions for you, I would really appreciate your input.
1. Besides the legal part of business (PLLC, NPI, etc) what should we look into when it comes to HIPAA rules and other  regulations that I need to be aware of when I start my business?
2. Best websites to create a website? Lol 
3. For people offering treatment/session bundles, how does that work if Say in my state, the direct access expires after 30 days?
Thanks in advance!!!

Anybody buy a new car under their business? I'm thinking of trading in my car and upgrading - wondering what the benefits / cons are of paying for the new car under my business

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dustin Howard bought himself a SUHWEET ride through his biz

> **Response 2:** I believe that the full tax credit only applies to new vehicles. (Not sure if it’s still over a certain gross vehicle weight anymore?)

Here is a thought in case you wanted a “less expensive than brand new” option:
If you buy a diesel or a hybrid, the mileage rate more than offsets the costs of the car.

That also lets you dip your toe into something really fun or quirky like a German diesel or a more torquey hybrid.

I’m a soloprenuer, and I’m considering starting a collaborative or collective with a couple of other providers. We would maintain our individual businesses but pool our resources, and share a space.  This would help us gain more of ￼a presence in the community and the ability to more easily share clients.  Has anyone done this before?  What are the pros and cons? ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sounds epic

> **Response 2:** Are there legal issues to consider with a collective?

Looking to start a mobile PT business and got a quote for malpractice insurance which I thought was really steep based on the research I’ve done. I know there are a lot of factors, but does $1500/yr seem steep to you? 

I am the only PT in the business and have 8 years experience. Thanks so much for your input and if you have any insurance carriers in mind send them my way:)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I got a quote for around $700 with CM & F. Curious though, many people are saying you only need professional when you're just starting out, but I was under the impression that you need the general/business to cover your workplace (I'll be treating out out of my home, want coverage incase someone trips, etc)

Lawyer has reached out for documentation and had a medical release form signed by client.

I have heard that you can send an invoice and charge the law firm.

How much and how do you go about doing this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use our state’s normal rates for copies, faxes, admin fees, etc. I ask chatGPT to add them all up and put in an invoice.

> **Response 2:** Ryan Friend … you CAN charge for your time to gather and send. Lawyers certainly do.  You can tell them that you have a $XX.xx charge for that 

You could give them documentation that lists the dates you saw the client and what was charged each time (should be the same charges unless you do a different charge for eval.).

Hello!
I am strongly considering going to a cash-based only practice except maybe keeping Medicare. I am in Virginia and I am currently in-network with just about all Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurances. Has anyone made this change? What are the drawbacks? How long did this take for you? Anything to be wary of? THANKS!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Highly recommend this to our therapists when just starting out

Jan 2023 I will be uncaged PT Hallelujah!   
Question: pt calls & ask do you take insurance?
I know my first response doesn’t need to be “No but I……” 
So give me your 1st couple of sentence response to this question that makes them not hear NO
Thanks in advance just trying to work on my marketing skills

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m real blunt, I just say “nope, I don’t contract with any insurance companies, I just exchange services for a flat fee payment,” and let it sit. I feel like right out of the gate that demonstrates the simplicity and transparency of the business model, which is one of the biggest upsides. It also can remind them that that is how most other business operate, and reinforces that that is entirely reasonable. Then I gauge it from there based on their response.  Sometimes I bring up super bills and HSA/FSA, sometimes I basically say “I am out of network for multiple reasons” which opens a door for them to ask why, and I can explain the benefits of the business model a bit. Sometimes I say “out of network care can be more or less cost effective depending on your coverage and issue” and I’ll follow with asking if they have stellar or poor coverage/copays if they’re post op or non op etc. which gives them a chance to tell me what’s going on and build rapport. I truly don’t try and sell every call, I openly tell folks when i think in network is the move if I feel they’ll benefit from frequent shorter visits and have great coverage, and when low cost is a massive priority for them.

Generally when I drop that first line and leave it, they’ll have some questions that will demonstrate sticking points if they have any. Ultimately most are just asking that because they think that’s how you’re supposed to shop for healthcare, not because they’re sold on going in network. Usually they’re calling because they want to tell someone their problem, so I try and get us to that point without shoehorning the convo in any particular direction. 

But, I also am not one that likes to haggle or do a lot of convincing. I don’t want a patient on my books that I have to fight to get scheduled because they don’t want to prioritize paying for care or can’t pay for care. If they truly can only afford me once every three weeks, have a ten dollar copay with deductibles met, they honestly may be better served in network anyhow, so I take the L, offer to help them find someone else, and don’t sweat it. 

That’s my approach. May not be the best from a brute sales perspective, but it fits my personality well and is authentic to me, so it works!

> **Response 2:** “It’s great to talk to you! I’m not in network with any insurance companies, but I’m happy to provide a super bill, which is basically just an invoice for each visit that you can submit to your insurance for potential partial reimbursement.”

**Original Post:**
Do you worry about medically necessary when seeing a cash patient?
Say I am out of network with patient’s insurance. I have a doctors order, and I am providing a skilled service. 
Patient is a young man who has a diagnosis that makes him have muscle cramps and pain.  Mom refuses to place him in pain meds. They tried massage, stretches, etc. he has a hep, stretch program and is very compliant. But it is not enough. Md suggested pain medication, muscle relaxers, but mother is set on avoiding drugs. They like that after my treatments he is pain free for up to 1 week (used to be 2 weeks until he relapsed 3-4 mo ago). I give superbill and insurance has been paying them faithfully but it makes me anxious that we’ve been doing this for almost a year. 
If tomorrow insurance decides all this therapy was not medically necessary because maybe pain meds were cheaper or whatever… am I liable? Even though I did not submit anything to insurance ? (Tricare)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My son is similar. What we have to do, unfortunately, is stop about once a year for a few months to show regression. As a mom, I wouldn't allow pain meds either. You just need more in my opinion. Sounds like your patient is showing regression when you aren't treating. That, along with needed skill, I wouldn't worry about it. My son won't make progress (most likely) but we are preventing "scissoring" from muscle contractures/scoliosis.

> **Response 2:** Tricare is fabulous insurance. As a recipient and also having a ton of Tricare patients I’ve never experienced a denial or needed to submit a note. If you are helping him with his pain and living a better life- it’s skilled.

Hi everyone! I started my own business so that one day I can eventually do my own thing but ended up coming into contact with a solo practitioner whose values align with mine- I love what he is doing with his business. It’s an orthopedic practice, cash based. He hired me on as a contractor as he is in need for a therapist due to good growth! I started with him about 6 months ago but have been struggling to get patients onto my schedule. They know him as the face of the company and I understand it’ll take time for people to know wh￼o I am. I’ve been doing injury screens and plan to run a workshop myself, as well as meeting more people in the community/networking. But can’t seem to get patients! And he keeps taking on new evals/has a waitlist. He’s told me to be patient but starting to wonder what I should be doing differently or if I need to take on PRN work until he can start to fill my schedule. I would love to market more but finding it hard as I’m not making much as is! And need to start contributing more to my finances with my family. Has anyone hired on their first PT as contract and had the same issue with filling schedule? Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have so many questions. First of all, is he paying you to do marketing and workshops? If he hired you to help him, why is he continuing on put new patients on his personal waitlist and not on your schedule? That makes no sense. It’s his responsibility to get patients on your schedule otherwise what’s the point in him having you if he’s just going to keep making his wait list longer. Seems silly to me. 

Secondly, if you are putting in the time and effort to market and network, do workshops…just start your own business. That’s a lot of work to essentially be promoting someone else’s company—go promote your business!

> **Response 2:** Had sort if this same problem at our clinic when we hired.  And the solutuon we used would require his help.  Try observing a patient of his. (I would volunteer this hour of your time)  get to know the patient and then co treat a little.  Then have follow ups scheduled with you.  What i do to this very day when i am trying to get a patient on another PT's schedule is to tell the patient that "jane doe" has avilability and can get you in right away. "She treats me" (which is 100% true)  that line works EVERY time.

Love this!!  I’ve been saying pretty much the same thing about the PT industry for years.



**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Eh. You can grow your own food too, but…I’m all for anything that makes it easier for people to move. Indoors, outdoors, cheap, expensive. I don’t care. Just be healthier. I’ll meet you where you’re at without all the judgement.

> **Response 2:** yes, its not always neccessary. AND this article is very ablelist. 
because not everyone can get down and do pushups. people who use wheelchairs can be super strong with machines and not be able to do much body weight wise. 
people with balance issues benefit from machines. 
cities have vastly changed since 20 years ago, not as much running space and capacity as there used tobe. not to mention that the streets arent neccesarily safe for women jogging outside. and black males running outside would be arrested much more often....
Yes, I am giving extreme examples just to point out that this isnt black and white. and that not thinking of psychosocial factors invoved with gyms and machines can be racist and misogynist.

and also gym culture can be good for the mental health as well. 

Story time: i went to the gym today (cuz im one of those that like the iron culture) and a women saw me doing super set of hamstring curl and pushups. yes i can do pushups at home but thats not as motivating. she says "impressive" and then said that she watched me do hip extension ex on the assisted chinup machine and she wanted to copy me. but then she said "i fractured my ankle really bad. like its destroyed. so im not sure if i will be able to do it well" . so the physio in me said, hmm, are you doing rehab. and thankfully she is. so i said ask your physio to go over step ups with you. its easier, its functional and you dont have to worry about the weight. 
so yes, she can do that at home. and doesnt need expensive machine.
but me doing it at home, wont cut it ;)

I have an interesting case that I want some input on from you all. 

Client complains of pain around the R eye/forehead that happens when he does any type of physical activity or standing up from sitting that lasts 15-45 seconds intensity of 6-9/10 and then goes away to a 0/10. Symptoms are reproduced with resisted left cervical rotation and deep palpation to right upper trap and SCM. He had a nerve block to occipital nerve which seemed to improve his symptoms. MRI of brain negative. Tested for temporal arteritis was negative. Tested BP seated vs standing and all WNL. 

Dry needling to R UT and SCM reproduced his symptoms and then improved after being in for 2-15 min. I haven’t DN suboccipital region. But any type of cervical exertion causes the headaches. 

Any ideas from anyone?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How long has he had pain for?

> **Response 2:** If the occipital nerve block temporarily relieved his symptoms consider nerve entrapment.  If therapy can’t fix him I recommend Tim Tollestrup MD peripheral nerve surgeon.

Hi everyone!
Has anyones google my business account ever been suspended? 😬
Apparently I made too many edits to it at once and it was flagged and suspended for “quality issues” 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
Doing some research, it looks like the appeal process can take two weeks!! That seems like an eternity.
Anyone else been in a similar circumstance? How long did it take for the appeal process?
Also FYI:
I use wix for my website, I made some edits to google my business there but it does not have all the features as it does when you login to google business. I made the changes in wix, then other changes in google. I think this is what suspended my acoount. Be aware and don’t make this mistake! ☺️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey, wanted to f/u to see if you found a resolution with this? I just found out that my Google Biz page was also suspended without any notification.
I just submitted a reverification request... hoping that does it. But I don't know why, when it got shut down at all..?

> **Response 2:** I put in my phone number and got suspended. it did take like 2 weeks. it was ridiculous. you had to email them to get out back.  Someone posted this number for Google awhile back 844-491-9665

I just dropped off a marketing package for a concierge doc. Gave the front desk lady a card addressed to her. She said I was the very first person to ever give her something!!! Don’t forget the people the make the office run! I also called her by her name. A little research and you can know who you’re talking too. I cheated this time and was in there for a podcast interview 2 weeks ago.

I own an in home personal training business for seniors in which I provide therapy inspired exercises (private pay). I’m ready to hire and need any help/advice I can get on hiring a 1099 employee. I’ve gathered that they need to fill out an agreement, a non compete, and a w9 form. Anything else? Also, should I write up the agreement or do I need a lawyer to do so? Any other other advice is welcome!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Before you move ahead, please understand that a '1099' is a form you issue to any contractor for whom you paid more than $600/year so they can report it on their taxes. (This law is if you're in the USA)

If you're looking for an employee, it's not the same as a '1099'.

By the sounds of what you're looking to do, you probably cannot have independent contractors because the workers will be an integral part of your business.

Here's a blog post that might help understand about the difference between ICs and employees. 

(Ask me how I know!)🤦‍♀️

https://www.irenediamond.com/are-you-an-really-ic-or-employee

> **Response 2:** As a current 1099 employee, I wouldn’t sign anything with a non compete. My feeling as an independent contractor is I should be able to work for whoever, whenever I want. If you want me to sign a non compete than make me a W2 employee so I don’t get killed in taxes and give me benefits.

Has anyone here branched out into a bigger business model to include an interdisciplinary approach to wellness?  
It's time for my business to scale and grow....
Looking at launching a Wellness Collective space to include my own PT practice and fitness studio, as well as adding Direct Primary Care, massage and the potential for other providers of holistic health and wellness.  

Wanting to connect with other who have treaded these waters, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a PTA, CPT and LMT. I do PTA home health 4 days a week and LMT/CPT as a side business. Although, I’m going full time LMT/CPT soon, I recently put in my notice. I’ll stay PRN PTA because I still love that as well. My plan is to offer strength training as well as hands on manual work as needed. I’m hoping to add Yoga and Nutrition to my services in the future as well. I want to have a full wellness business that offers in-home services for people who have trouble leaving their homes or just want more convenience.

> **Response 2:** Yes, but curious why you want all working independently as a “collective”, and not hire these at employees all working for the same business?

I want to give a shout out to the Uncaged Clinician team and my “village” for all the knowledge, support and encouragement given to me since last October. I have 3 work days left at my job of 18 years in acute care (29 years total) and 5 years in the outpatient clinic as a vestibular therapist and will be FULLY UNCAGED! Gone are the days of working weekends, endless charting, answering to doctors or insurance companies and asking for time off!

Balance Solutions Rehab is my “4th baby,” a MOBILE vestibular PT practice helping people suffering from vertigo, dizziness and imbalance, all in the comfort of their homes or preferred settings. I have specialized training in all things vestibular but have a special interest in vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). I believe in EDUCATION, EMPOWERMENT, CONNECTION, COMPASSION and COLLABORATION with a HOLISTIC approach. 

I am 10% sad to leave my colleagues but 90% giddy for this new adventure!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I couldn’t be more proud of this step for you. As a colleague and a friend, I know this is your path. Patients can not be in better hands!

> **Response 2:** So very very proud of you 👏🏼 Shana!!!!  
You did all the hard work to get here!!

Billing questions: or maybe more accurately… ETHICS questions… 

For clinics that have patients “warm up” on an exercise bike, Are you considering that time skilled and billable? 

Do you bill for thera-ex or act when techs are instructing the exercises? If so, what level of supervision are you providing to the techs?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Medicare and most insurances won’t pay for “warm-up” exercises or most equipment exercises if you aren’t documenting what “skills as a licensed therapist” that you provided. I just saw a denial today from UHC where they stated “NuStep is not a skilled service” and they took back the money for the time spent on it.

> **Response 2:** The time you spent on set up and education of what you want them to do on the bike could be lumped into your billable treatment time. If they just head on back and get themselves on the bike, I would t count that time.

I like the ideas above including balloons or anything red, even red Thera band if that’s what you use for exercise. If there is any room to dance, put on that nice music. And there’s so much talk lately about loving and hugging yourself, so maybe you could end that way￼

This company near me offers Pelvic Floor Therapy. They are Naturopathic Doctors, all fine, but I noticed this on their website - are they able to bill this under PT??? That doesn't seem right.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They can see the patient for pelvic therapyas a cash patient.  but it would be fraud to bill under Physical therapy and use the patients insurance benefits under PT if they are not a licensed PT

> **Response 2:** I do not know the answer to your question. I’m learning this too. But I do know that we as a physical therapy profession do not “own” CPT codes, they are universally used in the medical field and selected by a provider and should only be utilized within a scope of practice. So therapeutic exercise can be used for different professions than just physical therapist. So physicians can bill 97110 and they would put their modifier instead of ours(GP). Also, the Herman and Wallace Institute allows a wide array of providers to take their courses, including Naturopathic Doctors. Many other pelvic floor courses can be taken by others. I know a personal trainer that calls her self a pelvic floor therapy specialist and states she has multiple pelvic floor certifications. So if it is the scope of treatment for Natropathic Doctors to perform and they have the skill set then I suspect they could bill. I see many different professions calling themselves pelvic floor specialists from holistic doctors to nurse midwives to personal trainers. Also, they are typically skillful with the wording calling it pelvic floor therapy instead of pelvic floor physical therapy.

And another question for those of you who do group wellness exercise classes for older adults...I feel really silly to ask, but how do you come up with your programming - keeping it fresh and such?  I mean, I know exercises, but the thought of coming up with content that is general enough for a group for ongoing classes feels stressful.  I mean, I could totally present a class someone else planned, but to come up with it on my own...

Are there any resources for planning and executing group exercise classes for older adults (other than Silver Sneakers)?

Or any resources for already developed group exercise class content?

*Bonus points for Parkinson's related group fitness classes

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey! So, the very first group class I ever ran was for people with PD. (I still teach it!)

I was terrified. 😂

Starting out, I just made stuff up. Or straight up did stuff from LSVT BIG or PWR!Moves.

I still wing it sometimes. But I also draw exercises and circuits from others online. My class is primarily seated (by request), so I've had to get creative. But there are LOTS of Parkinson's (or general older adult) workouts on YouTube.

On YouTube, I primarily draw inspiration from Parkinson's Wellness Recovery and My Parkinson's Gym.

Happy to chat further via DM if you have more questions!

> **Response 2:** What Miller Finch said. I copy and mimic Richard Simmons. Then add a little bit of here and there for education. 😁😁😁

Question for this awesome hive- I’m working on 20 years with my OCS. I’m considering not renewing for the 3rd decade due to the fact that I haven’t been doing the submissions over the last several years like they want, and really I just question the value at this point. I have just about 30 years of experience. The OCS doesn’t qualify my skill or experience or worth. Do I really need to pay and do the scut work to keep these 3 letters? I was considering putting an asterisk next to the OCS and then noting the 2 decades of active certification. What do y’all think?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm nearly 20 years in. I do not plan on renewing. Early in my career I felt it carried weight. Now I feel like it's their way to collect $$. I know my worth. My 2 cents

> **Response 2:** I wouldn't. Patients know even know what PT is let alone OCS.

Earlier this year, there were several discussions here at Uncaged about what the APTA does or does not do for our profession. Listening to the voices of protest, concern, disdain, etc., made me want to create change.   

So when APTA Private Practice asked me to run for their Nominating Committee, I couldn't stop thinking about Uncaged and the mini-revolution inspired by this movement.   

I land on the side that the APTA is helpful, because it really has helped me:  
1) Make it affordable for PT's to serve those most in need.  
2) Saved my business thousands of dollars. 
3) Saved my heart by connecting me with amazing mentors. 
4) Gave me the confidence and a venue for speaking out about what is right and what is not in our profession.  

The APTA needs your voices. So if you are a part of Private Practice APTA, please consider voting for me. 
I'll work to magnify the voice of Uncaged Clinicians in shaping the future of small business in Physical Therapy.

What is the best option for liability insurance? I’ve used HPSO for the past 7 years but have heard there are better and less expensive options.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Berxi was cheaper than CM&F this most recent go around.

> **Response 2:** I had this same question. I posted somewhere else but didn’t get a response. I got a quote from Proliability for a lot less than HPSO but wondered about people’s experience with them. 
HPSO went up over $50 in one year so I am cancelling it.

Curious if anyone is sending “techs” aka not licensed personnel into homes while they conduct telehealth visits with said patient. How do you insure the person IN the home?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I still send my PTAs to do it for me. So after the initial evaluation that I do, they continue with skilled services. I've been wanting to transition to personal trainers to do this. But I can't find a good trainer. 😁😁😁

With regards to insurance. I have them all under my professional liability insurance.

> **Response 2:** They should be added under your business liability. Talk to the insurer. 

We did this for a long time.

My partner and I own a mobile, concierge physical therapy and wellness practice in South Houston/Galveston County. We are looking to hire an experienced DPT who wants a
* flexible/self-determined schedule
* autonomy and consistency with their patients
* and to provide the highest quality one-on-one care for 60-90 minute sessions

We are two genuine, honest, passionate moms who got tired of working for the traditional healthcare system and decided we could do it better. We say we provide an Elevated PT experience for our clients, but we also want to provide an Elevated employee experience. Please respond or share with anyone you know may be interested. We are looking for the right fit for us and for you!

I have an offer to be a partner with someone with a caseload of almost 40 patients a day and since this would be my first time considering any such role as a partner/co-owner of a PT practice, I’m looking for some wisdom on how to go about it and things that I should have in mind before I get into it?

What’s the going rate for cash based pelvic PT in Los Angeles? Someone I know is being charged $250 per visit. Is that reasonable?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The only person who can deem it reasonable or not is the patient/client. Does he/she feel that what they are receiving is worth the rate they're paying? Because we all value things differently, and see that value from different points of view.

My rates are well above the rates of anyone else in my area. But every one of my clients are convinced that what they receive is well worth every penny they spent. Does the fact that my rates are higher than anyone else around me mean that my rates are unreasonable? People who choose not to work with me probably think so. People who do choose to work with me often feel I am undervaluing my services. The eye of the beholder is a powerful thing.

> **Response 2:** That’s within average rates for pelvic PTs in this area. But I also think this post has an undertone of judgment about someone else’s rates. As Joe said above, the only person who can deem it reasonable is the patient/client. If they feel the service is valuable at that rate, they will pay it. If they don’t, they won’t. There’s room in the market for different levels of service priced at different rates.

**Original Post:**
Okay help me brainstorm…. What keeps a PT clinic from billing for skilled PT, and also charging for a gym membership and fitness training to address fitness goals that aren’t skilled?  It seems like as long as the patient is 100% informed about what is PT and what’s covered by their insurance, and what services are NOT PT and what the costs are, that we should be allowed to do this?  I’m just thinking about all the non-covered, “nice” perks that we provide under the banner of providing “high quality care”, which could more appropriately be charged for cash on an ala-cart menu of options.  

I imagine the cleanest legal way to do this would be separate business/LLC’s, separate spaces, separate billing systems, and of course some crystal-clear communication to the patient.  Anyone doing things like this?  

My reason for asking is actually that I am a professor teaching global fitness exercise to students, and they probably shouldn’t prescribe push ups and overhead press for plantar fasciitis patients, but I want to encourage them to maximize their value and skills even beyond the rehab goal. 

Of course this model also makes a strong case for cash-based services that simply provide for ALL goals regardless of insurance coverage…. But I’ve never done it!  Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I own a semi private training facility and PT clinic all under one roof, one LLC, one set of books. There is no issue. It’s a whole different service and insurance is not being billed for it.  They sign a membership contract for those services. This is also almost no different than someone being cut off by insurance and becoming a self pay patient,  minus the fact that you aren’t doing skilled evaluations or follow ups that would require documentation.

Hey y'all I saw a post earlier about a group of clinicians who got in trouble for fraud. I had a question regarding this. I've been working for a mobile home health agency for a couple months and we see all kinds of insurances. We have PT, PTA, OT, OTA on staff. For the PT and PTA my boss cosigns all of our notes and I believe he is the only one credentialed with insurance. He hasn't spoken to me getting credentialed. I work as a contract worker so it never crossed my mind that I may need to get credentialed later down the road. Is it illegal for him to cosign my notes for this long? He also wants us to see our pt's for 68 minutes so he can bill for 5 units. ( I'm in TX by the way )

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It sounds like you're doing mobile outpatient not home health? 
It sounds like they want you to do 68 minutes to use the rule of eights to get to that five units.  If the patient truly needs the care, That's okay although I feel like done repeatedly it might raise a red flag. I contact with a company locally who is also a mobile outpatient provider and they encourage us to work with the patients for up to six units who have traditional Medicare.  I find that it's not warranted in most cases and most patients can't tolerate that length of treatment anyway. 

But every so often I get someone who's really involved and I can totally justify six units. 

If you're a PT I'm assuming you're doing supervisory visits for the PTA?

> **Response 2:** I own a clinic with 4 other PTs and an OT, and had to get them all reassigned/credentialed under the business. So they bill with their NPI but it is under the business. 
I don’t cosign their notes.

Hey everybody.  This is gonna be a long one.

I’m trying to stay positive here but I’m just really frustrated.  I run a Medicare/hybrid mobile clinic and I am just having the hardest freaking time with all of the Medicare replacement plans outside of UHC and Humana.  Every Aetna, Anthem and Molina referral I get I just dread trying to figure anything out for them.

I finally got on availity, but it’s hit or miss if I can even use it to look up the patients.  Half the time I get error messages for the information I put in, saying numbers are correct when I know they are.  The other half of the time I submit for preauths and they can’t cancelled for no reason that I can find.  And don’t even get me started on trying to call into the companies.  The information I got for all three of these agencies was that I have to get “in network” in order to bill them, but the directions they all gave me to get in network were wrong.  

Anthem said I have to said a fax in to this designated fax number, the fax came back saying that it was undeliverable. 

Molina said I have to fill out the Medicaid form, but I don’t have a Medicaid number, nor most of the things that form was asking me for. 

And Aetna said I have to apply and then had a mile long list of things I had to do in order to apply.

And the kicker is I don’t even know if I truly have to be in network in order to bill these insurances, but when availity has been unrealizable in helping me look this stuff up. 

I know some of you will tell me that I need to stop taking insurance, and I would love to build up my cash paying clientele, but while I’m breaking into that market, this is what I’m getting referrals for. 

I guess I’m just looking for some guidance.  Does anyone have a tip for navigating this stuff better?  A person to call for guidance, a place to go for info?  Any info would be appreciated

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BCBS Anthem is horrible 
You have to send W9 for each and every claims for OON 
They are not enrolling any therapist for in network for state of GA!
Give them super bill and you get your cash!

And to follow that... I always think of Square and Stripe but sounds like people are pretty happy with IvyPay?  Pros / cons?  Anyone want to give me a link - IF you are truly happy with it 😁

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I like Ivypay. Pro is that the card is on file once you put it in initially so you don't have to swipe.  It is suppose to be hipaa secure.  My only Con so far is that the first payment did take extra time to process and I think I had to contact customer care, but they responded prompty and, after that, it has been reasonable turn around time for my standards.  Looking back at recent payments, it is taking 2 days to be deposited into my bank account once i bill the card. My code is shay098

I am a cash-pay mobile ortho PT.  My town has several affluent neighborhoods with their own magazines.  A couple have approached me lately to purchase long-term contracts to run ads monthly.  One has 4K homes, another with 550 (and growing).  Does anyone have experience/advice on this and the ROI?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree with the short term contract. As well as considering other marketing. Do you have a significant list for past patients?  That’s the best people to market to. The main problem with marketing to people is you’re trying to get them to know like and trust you.  The people that are past patients already crossed this bridge.  They’ve also crossed this bridge with their family and friends.  If you can get them to talk about you, that’s where the real magic happens.

> **Response 2:** Done it once and didnt even get a phone call.  It was in 8 different country club magazines.

I agree that Next door is best.   I respond to all posts asking for a local ortho,  rheumatologist, neurologist, etc and then add, if you need PT, I am....

It has worked great and cost nothing out of my pocket.

Have a warm list of around 40 doctors that have consistently referred patients to me and I've yet to formally meet with staff or doctors yet.

Pelvis NYC is in the process of moving to a new and upgraded location.
I will be reaching out to these docs to meet with them. 

I am looking for ideas to bring to their office. I'd like to bring them (staff and physician) products that they can enjoy themselves.

Few ideas:

-Water bottles with our logos on it (everyone lieks free stuff)
-Doctor's note pad with our logo on it
-Script pad with our contact details so they can give their patients the referral note with our info on it.
-Cards with our contact info and a QR code that leads the patient to our website to book a discovery call or visit.
-Clipboards with our logo on it.

So looking for ideas that may be trending better than these. Or if you all think some of these would suffice.

I once had a patient (occupation: sales person) tell me it’s one of the best marketing tools. A pens life span on average will be used by 7 people.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Google Forms for consent forms. 
If I need to set a plan of care to the physician, I use Google docs. I wish there was a way they could sign electronically but they have to print it out, sign and refax. 

If anyone has an easy workaround for this, I would love to know. I use 
Faxage, it's 3.49 a month and then I think you pay for extra pages

> **Response 2:** I email them the forms to print and fill out at home.   If they don't have a printer, I'll bring it on the first visit and have them fill it out before 2nd visit  

I have made templates for evals on Google sheets and fax those for POC.

**Original Post:**
My clinic uses JaneApp and has a 50% cancellation fee for no shows/ cancellations with less than 24 hours.  Patients sign twice agreeing to the policy on intake (once with a line that’s all by itself, and another among the long legal payment agreement).  They also get a cx policy reminder on each appointment reminder email… yet people are still shocked when it comes into play.

Generally if someone is actually sick/ emergency, we do not charge, just remind them of the policy but say this is an exception.  Also, if it’s less than 24 hours, but is the day before the appointment, the first time we also don’t charge, just remind them of the policy.

Is this a universal experience of clients being surprised/ upset by the fee? My Jane customer service person said that I have the cx policy on my documentation more than average… and I don’t want it to be too excessive to annoy the vast majority of clients who are very considerate of our small business.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wr are having this experience and it’s so frustrating. It’s in our intake forms at least 3 times (and very obvious) and we talk about it on the first appointment. Yet we have people call us and complain or argue when they see they were charged for their cancel or no shows. We are also 1:1 and it’s a whole hour of missed work for the business and therapist. It’s so challenging!

> **Response 2:** I have a “1 Freebee” rule where I waive it the first time and we have a very direct conversation along the lines of “sure I don’t mind cancelling but just be aware we do have a 24 hour cancellation policy. We will waive it this time but going forward there will be a charge of $xx”. I note it in their chart and honestly it either doesn’t happen again or there’s no argument.

I'm doing some research on potentially hiring my first PT here in California. It seems like according to CA law, PTs can't be classified as independent contractors. Is this correct? **Have any practice owners in CA hired therapists as independent contractors?** I wanted to hire independent contractors and have them function as PRNs, i.e. setting their own hours and choosing who they want to see. But I need to make sure it's legally sound to bring them on as 1099s instead of W2s.

(The law I'm referring to is AB5 and became effective in January 2020)

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cannot 1099 in CA under most circumstances.  

Can if it’s something you do not usually or customarily offer. 
But go W9 it’s essentially the same thing.  So bring on a PT that has incorporated themselves and you’re good.   They assume their own liability and risk and insurance etc.  but at that point you become a staffing agency so to speak.

> **Response 2:** I did a lot of research on this too before I hired my first PT in CA, and everything I found pointed to making them a W2 employee. Hope this helps!

Looking for some feedback please! 
I’m a PTA and have been in outpatient for 15 years. As my 2 boys are growing (10 and13) and getting more and more involved in sports, i have noticed that they and other team mates would benefit from education in posture, body mechanics, stretching, injury prevention and body work/massage… 
how can i legally provide these services for cash pay? Would love to be able to do this on the side.. i live in Tn and have to be licensed for massage, and hate to go back to school.. is their a bridge program? i have been trained and have ceu’s in different manual techniques as well.. any insight whatsoever would be appreciated 😊

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in Tennessee. Where are you at? You can always hire a PT. I do a lot of Telehealth for other PTAs. That could be an option for you.

> **Response 2:** I totally get what you’re saying as it’s a massive need (and would help kids avoid a ton of problems!). My inclination would be to get a personal training certification and just be careful to keep all your marketing and discussion wellness based and avoid the term treatment like the plague. The use of manual techniques could be getting into a “grey area” for sure, but then again I do this sort of thing you’re talking about virtually with athletes all over the place though I often talk athletes and their parents through some techniques when appropriate. As for hiring a PT as others have mentioned I’d certainly be curious as to such an arrangement and also making it cost effective for everyone involved. I’d certainly be open to a chat to brainstorm if you or anyone else is interested. Could we create a chat in the group on this topic David?

Hi all! Just starting my mobile, cash-based practice and insurance is making my head spin.

I'm looking at CM&F--do I need personal + general liability and then add my business as additionally insured? I'm the only PT, have an LLC, and plan on working part-time hours.

Thanks in advance for your advice!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same as K Joy Lind other than the reputation part.

I switched from CM&F to Berxi for the Medicare audit insurance since I am MC and private pay only.

Gen liability does not cover in patients home though so will need something separate for that.

> **Response 2:** Yes. I have Berxi and I also added Medicare / Medicaid audit ins as well as reputation ins for about $100 extra / year

My city's chamber of commerce is hosting a senior expo. The organizer estimates about about 500 people attended in prior years, and there are 80 vendors. 
Seems like an ideal space to market, however a table space is $500. What do you all think? Are these events worth the price of admission, or should I simply show up to the event itself in branded t-shirt and business cards and start networking without the table space? 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Great feedback everyone.  It was definitely better to navigate the crowd than to have a table. Thanks to Mike chua for the recommendation to video, and Anthony for the suggestion to use Jeremy Sutton's approach towards local small businesses. I got to interview a couple of businesses and it made for a more interesting and engaging experience.

> **Response 2:** Only worth it if you can afford doing it. I would rather attend the expo as a "curious" person and learn about their services and what they do and then you mention how you could help their business as well and swap info. Use those connections to try and provide free workshops for people that they help.

Is anyone familiar with the BERG test item 13 when they stand on one leg?  How do you grade it when they can stand on one leg 30 seconds and the other leg is not as long?  Its been a while and my thought is score 0 (needs assistance)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I meant the tandem test not SLS test, but either way, on item 13 or 14 it does not specify how to grade bilaterally when the patient can do the task completely fine on one leg but not the other leg (or tandem with right in front versus left in front).   Therefore in my mind if they can not do the task bilaterally I am being conservative to give a lower score.  What does everyone else do?

Has anyone offered just a small side service, such as soft tissue mobilization? I  am considering talking with my gym owners about offering the occasional upper extremity (just sticking to hand/wrist/forearm) STM for gym members. Considering cash-based 15 minute sessions, and just having supplies with me since it would just be an occasional offering, and I wouldn’t be setting up permanent office space. Not a series of full “rehab”, but would recommend they see their provider and hand therapist if it appeared they had an injury that could use a full evaluation. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just started doing this. Offering 15-30-45 min add ons. Can throw in manual stretching too

Hi y'all! I'm in need of a recommendation! I treat competitive swimmers. A particular female swimmer of mine (high school aged) presented with (bil) shoulder pain in the middle of the summer. She has done 9 PT appts with me (1x/week). Per her words, she no longer has pain but does have a lingering soreness in the anterior shoulders during and after practice. The soreness is not severe enough to have her get out of the water. 

She has horrible shoulder posture and also has a larger chest. Her mother informed me that she has had horrible posture for years (her mother is reportedly always on her case about her posture). I wholeheartedly believe her continued soreness is a result of her posture.

Her mother has asked for a recommendation on a posture bra. I know nothing about posture bras except for what I found during a quick google search. Seems they are built with a mechanism similar to the posture braces that promote scapular retraction. I'm not fond of these braces long-term. I would rather see her continue to strengthen her periscapular muscles and improve her shoulder/scapular stability.

BUT...would a posture bra be a good short-term solution? Can anyone provide any more insight than what you can find googling and/or particular brands recommendations?

> **Response 1:** Instead of putting a growing adult into some sort of “posture bra” you should educate her mother that there is very little research that supports “perfect posture” and the reason for her pain is because the child is most likely from trying to maintain that posture that her mother expects. Allow the child to sit how they like and let their shoulders relax, I would be surprised if her pain still lingers after that adjustment.

> **Response 2:** As a large chested woman, I’d focus more on getting her in a correct sized bra. Posture bras do nothing. Instead, she needs to go to a bra fitting store, or Nordstrom. They need to be prepared to spend money… good bras are not cheap. More than likely, she’s gone to target or Victorias Secret and is trying to fit herself in to the bras that are available. When she is in a bra that fits, the band should be quite snug. That’s where the support comes from. Cup size and band size are inversely related, so if her band has been too big her cup has probably been too small. Once she’s in the right size bra, then work on posterior chain strengthening to take some of the load off the biceps and pecs.

Y’all! This is (as Cap would say) FANTAWESOME!! For those who were at Success Council in Dallas this past weekend, you know there was a ton of 🔥🔥🔥!! The last speaker Jason Queen had this cool looking tripod to record his presentation and I asked him where he got it afterwards. This is the one and I ordered it Sat, got it today and it is PERFECT! It’ll fit in my backpack, extends to 60” and the phone clip can rotate 90 degrees for portrait or landscape. 

I don’t have an affiliate link so if someone does and wants to take this and repost it, have at it! It’s like $25!!

That is all, goodnight👊🏻

**Community Responses:**

They also come in all paper packaging products and they have a mission to plant trees to give back to the environment when you print with them

> **Response 2:** I use a local print shop, the quality is so much better and prices are too. Plus I can send the file over and they make sure it all looks good before printing. I like helping out another small business owner also ☺️

Recommendations for a business checking account when you’re just starting out and have no income (so trying to avoid fees!)?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Novo is great! They’re all online, so if you want a physical bank they’re not the one, but otherwise I’ve had a good experience with them.

> **Response 2:** I just opened an account with Bluevine this morning! I chose them because they have no fees on account maintenance or transactions and no minimum balance requirement. You can also add sub accounts to help organize your money without having to open up several separate checking accounts. You earn 1.5% in interest too. They came recommended on Forbes and Nerd Wallet. They are an online banking compny, so if you’re looking for physical branch locations, I’d look elsewhere. Obviously since I just opened it this morning I can’t speak to how they are in the long term, but those are the things I liked about them! Hope that helps!

For those who opened a physical location. 
I just signed a lease with my landlord, he’s asking for financial statements, I’m a start up business so I don’t know what is expected as far financial statements. Can someone shed some light? I asked my accountant and he said “you wouldn’t have P/L because you haven’t started operating” .

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is very common and seems standard practice. They want to determine if you have the ability to personally guarantee the lease. If you told them you are a start up I wouldn’t think they would have an expectation. As suggested above, provide a pro forma. List assets you have: equipment, home, etc. List what you have in your savings accounts as well. This seemed to start happening recently. I personally do not like this practice! I don’t like giving up personal information. However, they might not lease you space unless you do. 🤷🏻‍♂️

> **Response 2:** Was part of the terms of the lease in writing that you provided financial statements?  I wouldn’t think he needs to see your financial statements especially if it’s something that he’s just added on that he wants after you signed.

Is anyone willing to share their single visit rate vs package rate and how they went about deciding if packages were a good idea?   Currently I don’t offer packages but considering it as a way to offer a more affordable option to those who need it.   Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I did primarily packages for about a year and now have switched to $150/session. Honestly has just been better all around with everyone paying the same rate and losing less in discounts all over the place. I do offer paid in full options for anyone who wants nothing to do with Superbills/insurance and just wants to pay in full for 12 sessions. Those are 10% off but I rarely use those now

> **Response 2:** The rates people are sharing will fluctuate depending on location, specialty, and if mobile/concierge. Consider a sales tactic called price anchoring where you have a significantly higher single session rate and packages that seem like a great discount. This pushes people to get the package, which leads to more money upfront and commitment from the patient's end to complete the POC. Individual sessions can lead to drop off/no show when the patient stops seeing the value or if there isnt an immediate change

Thinking of PromptEMR (with billing), quickbooks (duh), and Gusto for Payroll. Does the cost of Prompt and its add ons make up for its higher cost? They make it sound like it’s pretty failsafe for billing compliance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use prompt with integrated srfax. For 1 PT and part time OT the cost runs to 650. I don't think it is cost effective.

> **Response 2:** We love prompt, if the team is utitlizing correctly and is trained on automations and features its well worth it and you should see a support staff reduction that should easily offset cost difference (depending on your team size of course). We used gusto for a few years and loved it, but eventually outgrew it. Just did not cover all our needs with multiple clinics

Hi all, looking to build out my pilates wellness program at my private physical therapy practice in Evanston, IL. Currently myself (I'm a PT) and 2 colleagues (one is a PT, one a PTA) do wellness sessions, but I am CONSTANTLY getting new requests and my existing people are saturated. Any leads on someone in the northshore Chicago area (a PT or an experienced pilates instructor) that are looking for more work would be appreciated! And I pay very well!

**Community Responses:**

I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with a lawyer who I suspect might as me to travel for a deposition. She asked me to send my fee, which I really want to get right in case I'm billing for a lot more hours. My gut said to just bill what I do for patients because my time is my time, but I scrolled through some old threads and see that people are charging a LOT more. What's the justification/ how do I know what to charge here?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I met a PT randomly who was asked to be an expert witness of sorts. He didn’t want to do it so quoted the attorney 1200/hr with 4 hr minimum.

They paid him upfront.

> **Response 2:** I’ve charged $400/hr, based on what I found as “the norm”. 
Also, be specific in you fee schedule to include that you get paid for time scheduled, even if they have to reschedule it. 

(I was subpoenaed to give a deposition on a case as a witness/expert, and had to take a day off from work, to do it, and they cancelled it 1 hour before I was scheduled to be there)

I currently do PT contract work  through my mobile PT LLC for a home health agency to round out my schedule, maintain predictable income, and through whom I often get a lot of referrals  when people are not home health appropriate etc. the company recently sold and is going from hourly contracted rate to per visit contracted rate. I will obviously need to re negotiate my contract but would like to have an idea of a pay range for per visit home health rate so that I can negotiate proactively. Anyone have experience with this? Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in North Texas… rates directly to agency for me are $100 for eval/reeval/dc and $80 for routine. I don’t do SOC for the one agency I work with directly but I do them for 2 contract groups. Ranges from $110-140 depending on which group and where the patient is.

Nice to have flexibility to simply say no when I want. If they are desperate for help, they have no choice but to pay. I wouldn’t take less than $140 for SOCs in your situation. I know of one PT getting $180 for an SOC in rural Mississippi. You have to account for your non billed time driving which is going to be higher in rural automatically.

> **Response 2:** I do the same and am paid per visit. Where do you live? I’m in Texas, and it will greatly vary from state to state (I.e. California rates are way higher), but I get paid 80-90 a visit on average for all visits. I do not do SOC visits. Just eval, RE, treat, DC! Been considering asking for a slight pay bump here recently to 90+ per visit. I’ll see if that goes over well lol! Greatly helps me do all of the above you mention being a PRN home health PT.

I currently have a pt that is being seen though insurance. There is a $30 copay per visit that my company has to charge.  The family is not able to afford the co-pay and is needing to step down therapy.  Is there a legal way for my company to continue treatment without billing for the copay?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Billing doesn’t mean collecting

> **Response 2:** Company can offer a payment plan to pay off the balance. But what bother me in this situations, that asking not to pay a co-pay or deductable really means asking the company owners to pay for their therapy. The same people who ask to not pay co-pays and  stating that it is too much for them , go and have nails done every two weeks or eat out weekly (or more often), etc. When a plumber comes and fixes something in 10 min and charges much more than $30  people pay and do not say anything. But for some reason when it comes to therapy, people do not want to pay. People pay enormous amount of money to veterinarians and usually it is all cash. It is all about the perceived value....Therapists are already underpaid professionals. And if we do not value our services, no one will. The reimbursement for our services is going down. A lot of times these $30 is the make or break for the company . Or it is what allows a company to pay our salaries. Please note, I am not an owner of any company.

So here’s what’s going on now with my OT practice. The lady who I paid to do  my credentials did NOT keep them up. My NC Medicaid has been terminated due to not providing a copy of my business license..RIDICULOUS since that’s all she had to do and what I paid for. 

I applied for re-enrollment Monday, they emailed saying I do not meeting federal guidelines. I have no idea what this means but I need my Medicaid in place ASAP. This has been a long annoying process. I feel like I spent all my money to get everything set up appropriately and nothing got accomplished except for emptying my pocket. 

I guess I will call them today. Anyone have any ideas, advice on this, or some encouraging words?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We used a credentialing company early on and had an aweful experience it is better to do it urself and just learn the process im not familiar with nc medicaid process but if u apply u can call and ask what else needs to be done

> **Response 2:** NC Medicaid does not cover PT in private practice except peds. That might be the issue.  Always take the lead on your credentialing even is you pay someone else for the busy work.

Hey Everyone. 
I am looking to get credentialed and contracted with some Medicare Advantage plans. Has anyone gone through this process yourself, and was it a difficult process? Or did you use a credentialing service?

If you did use a credentialing service, which would you recommend? I've gotten text messages and emails from people soliciting their credentialing services, but I'm not about to respond to any of those, I'd rather reach out to a company I know is reputable. 

Thanks for the help!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Courtesy bill out of network!!! Check their benefits and see if there are any stipulations to seeing them if you are out of network. I currently do this for plans with OON benefits, and they usually pay me Medicare rates.

> **Response 2:** I bill all Advantage plans OON. In my experience over a couple years the patient is responsible for either the same or slightly more than they would be with INN provider (maybe a $10
Difference in copay). No one has turned me down for it.

Hi all! Question about paying yourself:
I have an S-corp in CA, it is cash based PT only and my side business on top of my full time HH job. 
I have finally hit $10k profit this year and would like to pay myself. Apart from paying California taxes such as the annual franchise tax, what is the best way to organize paying yourself? Do I use a payroll service as an employee with a W2? Also, how do I calculate income tax on the amount paid to myself?

I tried to use the search for this but couldn't come up with any useful results. Any input would be appreciated as I'm new to this! Thank you :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I believe you have to pay yourself a "reasonable" salary for your work. That's what my accountant told me. I'd highly suggest asking an accountant and using one consistently that can help you with this. I've been surprised more than once with the rules I didn't realize existed. I'm in Ohio, so rules may differ, but the differences between LLC and s Corp consist of payroll, including payroll services, paying both sides of taxes, different tax forms, 401k matching etc.

So a couple of years ago… When I initially wanted to start with getting more consistent with videos, I mentioned something to    Anthony Maritato about it, and he told everyone that I was doing the “March madness challenge“ and basically called me out to do a Facebook live post every day for the month of March. (have to love the public accountability. )

I did it and did fine and enjoyed it and it was fun! 

So, to kickstart myself with creating consistent YouTube content, I was thinking about doing a daily video in the month of March and calling it something like “A month of Mobility in March” I figured I can film a lot of it and schedule the posts to drop on YouTube each day of the month and then do a little teaser or something on Facebook to drive some eyeballs to it.

My question is, is there something I’m missing out on to maximize traffic that I can plan for now as I start filming these videos?

Hello, 
 Is there anybody with a mobile business that has contracted or partnered with an assistive living facility of some kind where you provide group exercise classes for the facility? I'm looking into trying something like this and want some insight from people who have experience. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have some experience with this. It was a great set up, but ultimately the ALF  eventually hired an employee to lead classes as a way to save money. Happy to answer any questions if you’d like to DM me.

> **Response 2:** I am contracted with a group of homes with adults with developmental ￼ disabilities   Homes are group based on gender and level of disability. I have seen it all from humerus fracture from ￼ a fall during the Highland Park, Fourth of July shootings when the house went on lockdown too simple things like general hypotonia and difficulty ambulating or stair negotiation. The medical Director of these homes is very thankful. She does not have to fill out all of the paperwork for the residence being homebound and likes that I can provide more frequent treatment.

Question- 

I have an individual who just wants cupping done. 

Am I able to JUST do a cupping treatment session and give her that superbill or does she NEED an evaluation prior to get reimbursed?

Or do I require the entire evaluation for the first visit and can do only cupping after that?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s an “a la carte” service. If cupping is the only thing they want, you can just charge cash for a wellness/recovery visit. PT is a full eval and YOU decide whether cupping is the most effective tool to use. I do PT and also provide DN and recovery massage as a la carte services….although i will mention that some PTs prefer not to do this bc what ends up happening is that patients JUST come for those services and don’t actually make the huge improvements like they could. Right now, providing a la carte services align with my business goals but i can definitely see people prefer not to provide it. Make sure you’re charging for your time appropriately!! Massage therapists make at LEAST $1/minute and that’s excluding tip, mobile services, and additional modalities. My rates are $2.5-3/minute. I know you didn’t ask….but I figured I’d just put it out there. Hope that helps!!  😊

> **Response 2:** If you’re wanting to submit for reimbursement it needs to be a physical therapy visit, meaning you would need to follow your practice act, which I would assume means evaluation. I perform evaluations and treat the same day every time. 

If you’re not performing “physical therapy” and are doing “wellness” then you would not use CPT codes and not submit any sort of super bill.

How do I take my old employer off of my NPI?

**Community Responses:**

I currently have a mobile practice in Texas and have decided to credential with BCBS TX. When I try to fill out the credentialing application via Availity, I am asked about accreditation or when I expect accreditation to be completed. I know what accreditation is, but I'm mobile so I'm not sure how to proceed there. That next issue I have is the facility location, being mobile I assume that I put my home address. Has anyone had issues with BCBS TX with using their home address as the facility location? Any guidance is appreciated. TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following… also in TX and starting up mobile practice. Not positive on BCBS…

> **Response 2:** I’m a mobile practice based in Fort Worth and I got credentialed with bcbs with no issues. However, I used an agency. It could have been done without their help either (I realized it afterwards) 
Gave home address as the business, and have treated couple of patients already. Patient’s home is the place of service.

What would be good options for a COTA that wants to be the owner of an OT business?

Since COTAs need an OTR for supervision, co-signing notes, evals/discharges, to write goals, etc.…I’m struggling with how to get a business going when I don’t have the money to hire an OTR. Not until the business starts making money. How would I navigate that?

I’m interested in having a mobile OT practice that sees patients throughout the lifespan, & was thinking about taking Medicare, Medicaid, be OON for other insurances, & cash.

I’m located in Idaho, if that makes a difference.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m a PTA who owns a pelvic therapy clinic. I started by talking to PTs I had already worked with to see who would be willing to do some evals for me. I am a cash clinic so I’m able to pay well and I have a great working relationship with many PTs. I had a taker and she just works 4-8 hours per month doing evals PRN around her other schedule. I now have a second location with another PT that gives me 4-6 hrs per month. I do all treatments. 
Start networking, be generous as you fiscally can and flexible with schedule and you might be surprised who is open to working for you.

For the love of PT and mental health of all practitioners,
How does one start?!

We recently moved states. 

Interviewing at run-of-the-mill or half-a-notch above low expectations clinics after obtaining the local license, I just feel like walking  up the proverbial downstairs escalator.  

What got me most recently was the answer of a posh 1:1 practice place owner “if you maxed out of your 2 weeks of PTO, just take an unpaid day, we understand life happens”

3 years out of PT school, an LMT cross-over.  My patients knew and appreciated my touch and my passion to educate them onto their breakaway into strengthening from pain be it a trauma, post-op, or repetitive stress injury. 

I don’t want to be a PT drone anymore, ever. 

How does one start with little to no money down, like individual attention home health sessions, a gig at a gym, a personal acquaintance referral?..

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had an AWESOME PTA who I adored. She was amazing with patients and everyone loved her. One day, she walked into my office, handed in her notice, and said she was going to MT school. She has now opened her own place (in her house), treats 5 hours a day/4 days a week and charges $120 an hour. She is killing it! And, she is so happy. Honestly, I probably could have never matched that amount for salary. Not to be digging on myself (she actually gives me credit for building her confidence enough to make the move) but...get creative. If you are still an LMT it's easier to get people to pay cash. You could create an entire niche "All the benefits of massage with the knowledge to help you build strength". Whatever, come up with something more marketable, but you get my point.

> **Response 2:** Follow your passion. Some start with a table in a car, some start with a corner in a gym. Go to where your people are and do it with passion and you’ll find a way.

Seeking  help for a kiddo. That will not wear socks. He is 6 and understands but refuses to wear socks, the most time he would wear them around one minute before taking them off any helpful intervention ideas or unique sensory ideas

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m guessing there are more sensory issues than just socks. 

Getting an OT eval could help the family understand the big picture of the kid’s sensory system and preferences so he can live more comfortably and he/parents/teachers can understand his needs. 

I’d go for the root issues rather than just working on socks. 🩵

> **Response 2:** If he doesn't like socks, what if instead he rotates between pairs of shoes and focus is on hygiene? Knowing that wearing no socks is okay, but washing feet, and other things may be needed to help keep feet and shoes healthy. 

I hate wearing socks and shoes myself. I wear them, but I can't wait to get home and take them off. Same with gloves, I hate gloves.

Curious if he shared why he doesn't like socks? I think knowing why might help if that's something that's been asked and told.

**Community Responses:**

Has anyone had issues in NYS getting their PLLC name approved? I really wanted to use Moving Mountains Physical Therapy but it was rejected because it’s “promissory.” I then submitted breaking grounds which was also rejected for the same reason. Today I submitted Valor Physical Therapy and it was rejected because it was “superior”. I have no idea what to name it other then my last name or the city of which it is going to be established in without it getting denied. Any help or suggestions greatly appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

Hi all! 

Just had a potential lead at a gym ask me what I think of the hip hook? My initial reaction was “the what”? She started to explain it and I get what it’s for but before she invests in anything like this, I told her I’d ask around and she if anyone knows of good results, if any, with that gadget. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not a fan at all.  

I practice visceral manipulation and the structures anterior to the iliacus are also compressed by the hip hook. I’ve had more than one person come for treatment that has injured the ligament of cleyet, cecum, sigmod, etc by using it.

> **Response 2:** It’s nonsense. You cannot palpate the iliopsoas. It’s wayyyy too deep. Any relief you may get is due to noxious stimulus or placebo and is short term.

Hi Everyone! My wife and I own multiple fitness studios in Chicago. Our latest studio, in the Gold Coast neighborhood, has a large space available that we were thinking could be perfect for an "uncaged" physical therapist practice. Does anyone here have any ideas for how we could find someone interested in leasing part of our space? Our fitness studio has capacity to serve 500+ customers each week, and we get inquiries all the time from members looking for a PT, so there would be embedded demand for any PT that partners with us. We also have LOADS of equipment we use for our classes (treadmills, air bikes, kettle bells, dumbbells, med balls, pull-up bars, barbells, etc.), along with full locker rooms. Let me know if anyone has any thoughts, or knows of anyone that could be interested!

**Community Responses:**

Hey everyone! Big favor to ask for some family friends back home in Ohio. Does anyone has some suggestions?! 
They're in southeast Ohio and he's been in and out of the hospital and just finished a rehab stent for TBI past month.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Take a look into Fox Rehabilitation. They do outpatient homecare visits and can supply PT, OT, and speech therapy

> **Response 2:** can they reach out to the school there and see if they can help or provide free sessions ? OU has a pretty large PT program

Had a meeting with a large primary care practice (over 3,000 patients). They had a PT clinic in these 2 rooms for over 5 years and that practice led to open their own space elsewhere. They want me to sublease the space (the price seems quite high to me at $2k/month for these 2 teeny rooms). 

My thought is to offer a PT being on site 1 afternoon per week to see referrals as walk ins for screens and could schedule follow up's for that time at a fraction of that rent or maybe a % of revenue. 

I have owned my practice for over 10 years and am 75% mobile and have another much larger brick and mortar clinic on the other side of town at which I see patients 2 days per week. 

I love the idea of getting into primary care but not sure this is a good fit. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have 5 rooms in my office and the rent is $4350/month I live in Fort Worth Tx. The goal is to hire MT to work with me. But while I'm building my business I have other people renting the other offices (laser hair removal, Functional Med Nurse practiciner, esthetician, infrared sauna room, and bodywork) one day a week I have some one renting my office too. What I don't have is 3000 potential clients walking past my office.  That seems like a deal to me.  What are the lease terms? Could you split the lease with another PT that is specialized in something different than you, like Pelvic Floor PT. That way your not fighting over the same type of clients and or hire a PT PRN.  At the end of the day you want to enjoy the space your in and it to be functional.

Questions for starting a mobile practice! Just getting started (not seeing patients yet, just getting biz side organized) and new to all this, sorry if these are repetitive, have searched multiple groups and am looking for some more clear answers than what I have found. TIA! :D
1. DBA vs LLC? Was recommended by an attorney and an accountant to start with just DBA to reduce initial overhead and annual costs until I have a steady revenue stream. Pros/cons of either? I have looked into this extensively but having a hard time finding specifics aside from the liability and assets. I also read that my SSN would be put on superbills if I did not set up an LLC with a separate EIN? Is this true or are there ways around putting your SSN on superbills?
1. Direct access limitations: if there is a limitation on how long we can treat (90 day direct access), how do you contact physician at end of 90 days? With a plan of care and get their signature? Does this mean that whatever EMR system I choose should be set-up to fax? I was going with Jane App but saw that someone said they aren't set up to fax?
1. Do I need to go into Proview and update all my personal information, license renewel, etc? It was previously filled out by my former employer. Is this only if I plan to accept insurance (I don't)? 
1. NPI type I or II? I plan to be strictly cash based with option to provide superbill.
1. Is business coaching worth it? I know I probably need it, but I ended up having to quit my job because my childcare fell through, so I do not currently have a reliable paycheck and want to keep costs low. Are their any coaching or mentorship programs that are less than $1000 that people have found worth it? Thank you all so much!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** LLC will protect your personal assets. It separates your personal from business and it doesn’t cost much to do vs liability.

> **Response 2:** In MI a DBA is under an LLC?

Does anyone have a yearly membership or retainer program? I’d love to chat and see what that looks like. I have a client that calls me when she travels and gets dizzy. She gets recurrent dizzy spells and needs help navigating her symptoms. I also see her in person when she is in state. So between phone calls, virtual sessions, check ins, home exercises, and in person sessions I’m wondering if I could put some kind of package together that she could put me on retainer( and what people are charging for something like this)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A membership program has been on my to do list 1.5 years. Would love to hear what others are doing.

> **Response 2:** I've spoken with several MDs, Chiros, and PTs who have done this. The over arching theme has been that you make money from having a lot of members and not by charging a lot. You still have to charge a good amount. $100/month is $1200 a year and if you have 100 members, it adds up. 
I have not started a program yet though so don't follow my advice. I am still running numbers so that I don't over promise and under deliver or get bogged down.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are they supplying you with patients and taking care of your EMR? Are they responsible for cancellations and no-shows? Before signing anything I would definitely ask some more practical situation type questions. Are you making your own hours? How much are they getting reimbursed if it’s $150 then you’re getting less than half and doing all the work.

> **Response 2:** I think it depends on a lot of things. How many clients you have to see, how many and, etc. If you know your cost per visit or hour, then you can use that to help decide how much money you’ll be making

Posted this in another group and got no traction so hoping you guys might have some insight. Sorry to those where it’s crossposted…..

Had a random thought about overall payment structure. I know many offer discounts for bulk purchase of sessions, and some offer monthly subscription services. However, has anyone ever successfully implemented extended payment plans to overcome the upfront cost in low-income areas? 

I know there are a handful of quite successful cash-based practitioners in my area that are crushing it (Love seeing your success Russ, Sean, Mike, Derek), but they are all based in more affluent neighborhoods of the region. While I ended up taking an insurance based position when I moved for stability while I focused my energies on growing my online services, current familial and clinical ownership changes might be re-invigorating the drive to get out of the mill and I’m thinking through potential hurdles as I rebuild the business plan.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Another option is to bill out of network instead of being strictly cash based. It’s a little bit tricky at first because you have to find out which plans are worth submitting vs just collecting your cash rate up front and having the patient submit a superbill on their own, but if you can figure out which ones are worth it, you will likely get paid more than your discounted package rate.

> **Response 2:** I’ve done a payment plans for splitting the package into a maximum of 3 payments spread out throughout the plan of care with the last payment having to be paid before the last session. I have never done extended payment plans beyond the plan of care.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Tough, sole practitioner are tough to sell, cuz your patients like you. Start immediately, call every therapist you know and sell them on the idea of being there own boss and the financial benefits. Be honest and open. Make it a win -win. Someone wants to be in your shoes, GL

> **Response 2:** Is there any chance you can hire a PT and continue to operate the business from another state? You would do all the admin work and the therapist would see the patients. You would likely earn more from operating the business like this for a couple years instead of selling

I see patients privately at their home and haven’t run into this yet. I have a former patient wanting to see me after her TKR. From my understanding I cannot accept cash from her, she is under Medicare and the services I’ll provide are medically necessary and covered. Is this correct?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can bill Part A for home health as long as she meets homebound criteria and then switch to Part B when she is no longer homebound

> **Response 2:** That is correct, cash cannot be accepted for medically necessary and covered services which it would be. If they're discharged from PT and have goals beyond what is medically necessary then you could though. There is a bill up for PTs to be able to opt out of Medicare and then you would be able to but currently as it stands we are not able to opt out

I’m sure there are some billing experts on here. I am DESPERATE for some help. I’m in Texas and working with the medicaid population. It’s been a hot mess to say the least transitioning and dealing with the new EVV requirements. I love treating this population so I am crazy enough to deal with this mess.

I am forced to use a new billing system and I keep getting this error and I am having a hard time deciphering what this means. This is for the CMS1500 form. 

21: The Rendering Provider Secondary Identification (2420A REF) information may not be used when the Rendering Provider Identification code (2420A NM109) is present.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Give Certified Reimbursement a shout. They’ve taught us a great deal. Yes a billing company costs money. But they should make that money back for you, avoid denials, and cheaper than a dedicated person to collect on those claims. Especially for a smaller practice. Just my opinion and experience.

> **Response 2:** Medicare Billing for (Mostly) Cash Based PT, OT, SLP Providers Group might be a helpful group to be in too (if you aren’t already!)

Those who take Medicare part B: have you had BCBS federal employee plan used with Med B. Is this a supplemental plan? I’ve been trying to call but could not reach a human. My patient lives in Kentucky so he has Kentucky Medicare and BCBS FEP but is also a snow bird and stays with his granddaughter here in FL part time. He is in FL at the moment after brain surgery and I’m seeing him for PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, typically it’s a supplemental plan

> **Response 2:** Careful with FEP secondaries (not supplements). It depends which plan they have. I think my patient had preferred and they wouldn’t pay, because I was out of network. So it was patient responsibility.

**Original Post:**
I’ve been connecting with a local DPC/concierge doc, and we want to formally collaborate. She’d like to be able to pipeline her patients to me, but include my service as part of the fee they’re already paying her (so not just a referral, and then they pay for my service). We are trying to figure out how to make this work so that I am also getting paid what I am due. Could this be as simple as the physician paying me out of petty cash from her practice when I see one of her clients, or do we need to go through credenting and billing as if a traditional clinic? Or something else?? Open to ideas … I have been totally solo an fully cash-based practice for several years, so this is new territory!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love that you’re thinking through this before you jump in, because the way you structure it now is what’s going to make this collaboration actually work long term.

There are a few clean ways to look at it.

First option: treat it like you’re getting free leads. If she wants to keep her pricing exactly the same and not rearrange anything, that can still work. The big thing is you cannot let people just show up at your door expecting free ongoing PT. You need a 15 minute phone call with them first so you can set expectations clearly…
“Here’s what the eval normally costs, here’s what this first session looks like inside your DPC membership, and here’s what people with your issue typically need in terms of sessions.”
Basically give it the full discovery call feel so they understand where the free part ends and where your actual plan of care begins. That protects you and makes the whole thing way smoother.

Second option: if she’s planning to raise her prices, then your service can just be baked into that increase. It becomes a value add for her members and she stays whole financially. My guess is she’s probably not looking to raise prices, but it’s still worth mentioning because it’s the most straightforward version of the model.

Third option: she pays you directly per person she sends over. If you go this route, compare it to what you’d normally spend on acquiring a patient. If you’re running paid ads, depending on your city you might be paying anywhere from $80 to $150 just to get someone on a phone call. These aren’t cold traffic leads though. These are warm, already-sold referrals coming from someone they trust. That’s worth a lot. Your conversion rate on those will typically be double what you get from ads.

If you frame it that way, you can structure a win-win so every patient who needs PT goes straight to you as the default, not “one of several options.” She sells it as part of the experience. You take it from the first call onward.

So you’ve got a few models here. Just make sure whatever you choose sets expectations properly and positions you as the consistent PT solution for her people. That’s where this kind of relationship becomes genuinely fruitful instead of chaotic.

> **Response 2:** You have to be careful with these laws -the easiest way is to just accept referrals from the doc : 

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS): Prohibits knowingly offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (cash, gifts, discounts) to induce referrals for services paid by federal programs (Medicare/Medicaid).
Violations are felonies with severe penalties (prison, fines, exclusion from programs).
Stark Law (Physician Self-Referral Law): Prohibits physicians from referring patients for certain services (like lab work, PT, imaging) to entities they or their family have a financial relationship with (ownership or compensation), unless an exception applies.
State Laws: Many states (e.g., Texas) have independent anti-solicitation or anti-kickback laws that can be stricter.
Professional Ethics: The APA and other  organizations specify that payments should be for services rendered, not based on the referral.

Are there any mobile ortho PTs in the group that have successfully become a "preferred provider" for orthopedic surgery group(s) in their area?  I really feel like this is an important group for us to market to, but there's a delicate line because they often have preferred PTs in their community (clinic based) that they want to feed referrals to for one reason or another.  IMO, offering 1-2 weeks at home for early post-op would be a sweet spot, then refer them to the standard clinic (if the referrer and/or patient wants to) for the remainder of rehab...?  I am thinking of the smaller ortho procedures (knee 'scope, RC repair, ACLR,) which aren't likely to qualify for home health, but need early PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Interesting idea. Would you do this as a cash based service for non-Medicare folks or through insurance?

> **Response 2:** I have a mobile PT solo practice, and about 70% of my patients are first 2 weeks post-op total knees. Then the docs send them out to whatever clinic they want. I really enjoy it!

Has anyone successfully transferred their Google Voice phone number over to a “real number”? Like if I wanted to get a complete separate phone for my business apart from my personal phone. Main priority is keeping the same number. My other thought is I could get a second phone and still use google voice on that phone with the same number. My problem is I can no longer tell which calls are coming through Google voice for my business versus for my personal number. It used to look different when a call came through but after I updated my phone awhile ago it looks the exact same. I want to be able to screen calls and answer appropriately

Hello! Looking to start my own practice within the next 5-6 months and have the option to rent a space at a local CrossFit gym. Curious what pros/cons you have experienced when having an office at a gym! I searched the group and didn’t find exactly what I was looking for. 

We discussed paying a lower monthly rent with an additional fee based on hourly gym equipment usage. Approximately 400 sq ft. 
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve built my entire business out of CrossFit gyms. Depends on the population you want to treat. My ideal client is a CrossFitter, so nobody has minded the music or noise. I’ve had a lot non-CrossFit clients go on to join the gym afterwards even. I just pay hourly with a cap. Use of equipment is included. I’ve never had an issue with CrossFit gyms not wanting their members to go to other gyms for rehab. I get sent people from most of the gyms in the area without any issue. They want their members healthy and back in class.

> **Response 2:** I know many people including myself that have started and grown very successful practices inside of CrossFit gyms. 

A sliding scale initially is a great idea if they are up to it. 

Basically assume the “full time” price and work backwards form there

If I was working here full time it would be this price then adjust for 30 hrs or 20 hrs or 10 hrs etc.

Question for mobile PT's that also successfully have their business listed on Google and it comes up in a search for "physical therapy near me"...

Hi, so I'm currently 100% mobile.  I had my business listed on Google successfully for a while but in order for it to come up in a search of "physical therapy near me" I had to include my home address, which I had just accepted and was fine with ( I also had gotten a few leads this way).  But I actually don't see clients in my home.  

Well recently, Google froze my listing saying it didn't comply with their standards...with no notification or warning.  😳🤬
I had to submit a request to reinstate, and they did finally end up reinstating (they also never told me how my listing didn't comply), but now it doesn't have my address listed and so I don't come up on a search (or on a map).  It did ask me if I saw clients at this address (so I'm assuming that's why it's not longer appearing).  Does anyone know if there is a workaround or remedy for this?  

I still don't entirely understand all aspects of SEO and all that is involved with this, but wondering what other mobile PT's have done.  Or if you have suggestions of someone to consult who might be able to help.  TIA!  

Picture so this post doesn't get lost...and well just because it was a great freakin' sunset on my drive home Monday.  And you gotta stop and appreciate those kinds of things.  😉

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't have any suggestions as I also struggle with this and anything SEO, but wanted to say your picture is incredible and thanks for the reminder to notice the small stuff 😊

> **Response 2:** Are you talking about your gmb or do you have a website? And how does Google know you legit work from that address or not? It just has to be a valid address....if you don't want your personal info out there, could you use the post office? Or are you saying since you don't work from the address Google cancels you?

Sorry for the semi-long post.  I have been a member of this group for a while, but just recently left my corporate health care job to join a small private practice (2 other clinicians with 2 locations).  In the system we had more patients than we could handle, now I'm struggling to find any.  I have 2 kids and as the bread winner in the family am feeling uncertain about my decision financially.  What tips do you all have for free marketing, reaching target audience, etc?  Limited budget for spending on these kinds of things.  I would appreciate and and all help you seasoned uncagers have to offer!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Erin!! I think it helps to “niche” down and market right to the people of how you can treat differently than in the hospital system! I’m happy to chat with you since I see you are now in Brookfield by me 🤗 congrats on the move!

> **Response 2:** Interview the referral sources in your own podcast and show. Show them how you can help them. Give give give. Serve serve serve. And then ask ask ask after. Or if you don't want to do that. Run FB ads. We are so busy that I turned it off. 

I started with interviewing them in our podcast and now do hybrid. 

Good luck!!!

I like to send a handwritten thank you card to each MD that sends me referrals, every time they send me a new patient. Would you name the patient in the note? or just a generic "Thank you for the referral". Is anyone else doing this?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As a physician, I would like a "Thanks for referring (patient name). She is progressing well and I plan to see her for another x weeks. She has a followup set up to see you after that. Please don't hesitate to call us you have any questions about her therapy."

As all healthcare providers, physicians are busy. I dont want to spend the time opening a card that just says thanks for the referral. What does help is someone saying you passed the ball, I've got it and I'm taking care of the patient. It also helps that it's noted the patient has a followup already and it's not asking the physician to look things up or set more things up. Hope that helps. If it's ok with HIPPA (I would think it is) it helps to include the name because there are certain patients that stick out to you and having that reassurance in a quick read is gold.

> **Response 2:** If possible, I’ll personally drop off the eval and offer an in-person thank you to any new MD referral sources, which removes any HIPPA issues. 
Also, I set up a weekly call in time w several of my main referral MDs, so I can give him/her a quick live update about their Pt’s. They appreciate getting live feedback, so they can ask questions etc. This is especially true for those MDs who offer concierge cash based services; as they want to really be on top of their pts and want their pts to know their getting full personal service and care. This way, they tell the pt “I spoke to your PT, he said you’re doing better etc”. Also, it helps me recapture lost/lazy pts, as the MD will call them to remind them to restart PT

Does anybody have any thoughts on using PTEverywhere vs. Jane?  I signed up for PTEverywhere but the system they use for billing is so much more expensive than what I use currently and the point of signing up with PTE was to save myself time and effort and be able to have more time for treating etc. But I can't switch billing systems and pay even more, so now I'm not saving time or effort.  So I'm curious of the comparison of the 2 in general and if Jane's billing system is reasonable with fees - I do all of my processing online and not in person with a card reader. 

Any thoughts on that and on the usability and friendliness of either system and on the costs of it in general would be super helpful!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We switched to PTE last year. Unless they change some things in the coming year or so we are out. We are self pay so the billing isn't an issue. Their reports and systems aren't all that flexible and don't do as much as I'd like

> **Response 2:** I only accept self pay, but I love Jane! Super easy to learn and their customer service is quick and really helpful when I have had questions.

Thoughts on asking a credit card to be kept on file (with a non cancelation policy) on a cash business? Trying to “nip” no shows and/or last minute cancelations.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A credit card on file is required at the PT practice my daughter goes to, my dermatologist and our dentist require one. It’s pretty standard these days of privately owned medical practices.

> **Response 2:** We collect the card and there is now a 1 page cancellation policy. Be prepared for people to be pissed. I honestly would rather weed those people out and get them off my schedule because they are the ones that are the habitual late cancels and no shows. To me it’s disrespectful of the therapist, business owner, and other patients time (which is what my cancel policy says). With that I do usually tell people they get a one time freebie and next time the policy will apply.

Discussion topic: 
Pros and cons of-
Owning your own business without benefits provided. 
Working full time for a company with benefits in a clinic.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻 what they said!  Never asking anyone for time off is better than any other benefit I could think of.  I could never go back!

> **Response 2:** Risk and Reward. 
Reward= No ceiling/unlimited earning potential, lifestyle freedom. 
Risk= not succeeding and making less $ than working for someone, never being truly “off” from work. 
Being on your own isn’t as glamorous as the masses may think. Comes with a lot of stress and liabilities, but in the end, it’s the only way for some.

Next summer I plan to get certified in Dry Needling. I am in Central Wisconsin and am cash/ non-insurance based PT and wellness. Does anyone have any recommendations on pricing for dry needling services ? I’m in the preliminary phases obviously but I am a planner at heart and want to get an eyeball on things if and when possible. Any help is appreciated! Also, if anyone has suggestions on which dry needling training y’all used, that would also be appreciated. 
I am a GCS and LSVT-BIG certified as well.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I like Rachel Garrett’s thoughts. I also have had sessions where the only thing performed was dry needling, and I charged my full rate. 

What’s important, Christian Biegel, is that (all of us) must get away from “a CPT code value” for a service (yes, I know. Dry needling isn’t covered, but the concept of “this thing is worth this amount”). Instead, we should recognize that people are paying for our knowledge, skill, experience, etc. 

Scott Dixon has a phenomenal course.  There are several others out there also.

> **Response 2:** I have a cash pay practice in Oshkosh and regularly utilize DN with my patients. I do not charge an additional fee if DN is used as a part of a full PT session. I do offer a mini-session for clients with an established POC who just need DN or manual therapy. After a full evaluation session, I offer appropriate clients the mini session for $75

What is ur rate for just dry needling? Where are u purchasing needles from?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dry needling is included in my plan of care and I never do it without exercise or neuro re-ed to follow up. It’s a disservice to patients to needle them without following that up with retraining the muscle. They will feel good for a bit then have to come back for more needling since the underlying issue isn’t being addressed. My visits are getting ready to go up to $180 this summer. I pretty much use only Serins from Lhasa since I can use them for try trigger point dry needling as well as with STIM or for fascial/scar needling. They are the most versatile needles I’ve found for all the ways I utilize it in my practice

> **Response 2:** PT is not a drive-through or ala carte service. Dry needling should be part of an overall plan of care.

I have a potential referral for a child with duchenne muscular dystrophy. My background is orthopedics and I don’t have experience with this diagnosis. However, the mom really wants someone to come to the home because it is too hard to get him PT. With full disclosure to the mom about my background I would be willing to work with this client because she doesn’t have any other options. Homecare wouldn’t provide long enough care to the client and she would do cash pay with me. I wanted to ask the group for general recommendations in working with this diagnosis and if you think I could take this on. I don’t know the patient’s condition yet and am trying to go into the phone conversation with the mom prepared. Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you have a PT or OT degree then you have the Background needed to treat this population. Use you critical thinking and all the tools in your tool box. The hard part is setting realistic measurable goals. Might have to do some research. Dig deep. You won’t regret it. I had a friend with Duchenne’s who live to be 55. He taught me a lot about being a human and the need to be able to verbalize exactly what you need to get the care you need/desire.

> **Response 2:** Prognosis is not good…very sad to see such kids…there is a lot of atrophy and hyper trophy of muscles( especially calf with classic gower’s sign where a patient ambulates on all 4’s) …eventually diaphragm muscle is involved in the last stages…your best bet is to stretch all the muscles of the body…pnf techniques,keep the Rom / function as much as possible and a special focus on diaphragmatic , lat coastal expansion and other breathing exs…hope that helps..all the best..whatever you do will help the child..

**Community Responses:**

This is a HUGE passion project for me. Work and Leadership through the lens of faith. 

I'm hosting a 6 week intensive focused on developing as leaders. 
Starting June 1 at 8:00 am EST, 6 weeks work and leadership intensive through the lens of faith (If we have enough request for an evening time I'll host 2x/week. All sessions will be recorded for watching after as well)

Week 1. Calling, Equipping, Your Why? 
 - We’re often told to think about our “why?” What does this mean and where is your why coming from? 

Week 2. What gets in the way? Our Stories
 -Each of us has a history of wins, lessons, trials, tribulations, successes and seeming failures. Each of these has a voice that comes with them that competes for our attention. Which voice is loudest to you and what does that mean towards you progressing towards your goals?

Week 3. Enneagram 
 -We often focus on our strengths and weaknesses but how do you view yourself in terms of your motivation and how do you communicate that to yourself and others? 

Week 4. Boundaries
 - We’ve all been told that having boundaries is important but how do you understand the tension between boundaries and the calling to love, serve, care and lead? 

Week 5. Creating Resilience 
 - what is the process we need to go to become more resilient people and leaders? 

Week 6. Stand and Lead
 - What do you stand for? What do you aspire to be as a leader?

We’ll be reading 2 different books included in the price of the 6 week intensive. Strong and Weak by Andy Crouch and Tempered Resilience by Tod Bolsinger. The cost of an Enneagram assessment is also included in the cost of the program so please sign up early so you can get access to the readings in advance! 

NOTE: We'll be discussing faith through a Christian focus but all are welcome, I just want to be transparent about the direction I'm coming from.

Hi everyone! I am looking to start my own cash-based practice. I have specialty experience in both pelvic health and spinal deformities(scoliosis/schuermanns etc), both of which I feel are underserved populations. I would also like to start teaching Pilates again. A few questions:

1) Where do I begin when starting my practice? I live in TN, I’m relatively new here, I’m using the compact agreement between TN and NC. I have an idea of services and the model I want to use, but the legalities of starting a practice confuse me. I don’t plan on accepting any insurance. 

2) If I start simple, with only offering private Pilates lessons (no PT), does this conflict with my PT license? I’ve been told that the liability will always fall on my PT license, even if I am only offering personal training/Pilates. I have a 4 month old at home and my husband is deployed, so I thought the private Pilates/personal training would be an easier place to start than PT services, but I don’t want to have any conflict or fail to follow any rules. For those that offer both personal training and PT, how do you keep the 2 separate? 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading, hoping those questions make sense!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Where in Tennessee? I'm here at Jackson. Good luck!!!

> **Response 2:** Hey I practice in TN and MS. I would suggest looking at the TN practice act. 

TN allows for you to provide wellness services and also allows 90 days of direct access if wanting to perform PT. I work with golfers and always just have inform the MD when 90 days is coming up and that allows direct access to continue. But I am not a lawyer, so take everything with a grain of salt. 

I highly recommend speaking with one of the Uncaged Coaches.

Hey!

For those of your with brick and mortar clinics, I figured a shopping list to get more folks lifting more weights in person might be helpful.

The most common thing I hear keeping people from buying equipment is price, so this "shopping list" comes in just a little over $2k for a really nice setup!

I have no affiliations with any of these companies

Lemme know if you have any questions!

Is there any way to offer cash pay services to someone that has Medicare? To my understanding this is not allowed but is there a way around this? I currently have a total knee patient that would like to pay cash.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If the person needs skilled therapy (ie post op care from TKR) you can’t just get around it by calling it wellness. You can only charge cash for non covered services.

> **Response 2:** Unfortunately no but you could always convert them into a wellness client once PT is done. I've done that with a lot of my patients. 

I think it's awesome that so many clinicians on here are cash based. But I'm amazed that someone would pay cash pay for post-op total knee rehab when insurance covers it. I feel like most PTs do a pretty good job in this area

I would love to hear from cash therapists in small rural towns NOT in California or states with higher income.

I am in rural SC, town with no more than 30k people, 1.5hs from bigger city, average household income of $55k.

I run a great successful insurance practice with 1-1 individual high level care, high success rate, but can only see so many a week and I can make same income working less doing home health. 

I am basically working more and making less just so I can choose my own PTO. 

Pelvic floor - I’d need to charge at least 162 to make budget 

Ps if you are insurance based or feel cash based don’t work in small areas this is not the post. I want to see who made and succeeded

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are TONS of cash practices in rural areas that thrive. I’m still building my practice, but I was able to replace my income from both my full-time insurance job and my PRN acute care job by seeing 8 patients/week. If you’re thinking of starting your own cash based pelvic practice, recommend Pelvic PT/OT Entrepreneurs group and looking into the Pelvic PT Rising mentorship programs because they are a total game changer.

Correct me if I’m wrong,  I’m in-network with BCBS TX PPO and currently seeing a patient in-network for 60 mins. Are you guys billing 4 units still right? Others mentioned the SPM method to be able to charge more units but I‘m not too sure about that? Thank you!

For example
1 therex
1 neuro reeducation 
1 gait training 
1 manual 
1 ther act

Is there a different CPT code for physical therapy evaluation (high-complexity) for at home outpatient service?

Thank you for help!

Is it crazy to specialize in geriatrics if I want to do cash-based mobile services? 

(City with a population of 110,000). Background: I love working in Parkinson’s and have a lot of experience/training there. But those folks will nearly always qualify for maintenance, therefore, Medicare billing, right?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I disagree with "nearly always qualify for maintenance." My practice is young, so take this with a grain of salt. I have had some luck graduating patients from formal PT into a cash/wellness program once they no longer meet restorative PT or maintenance PT eligibility.

Maintenance is also typically a very low frequency. Once weekly or less. I haven't had luck with this yet but hope to build up a roster of hybrid peeps where MCR pays for once weekly maintenance visit but then they pay cash for extra visits to up their frequency to 2-3x/week.

It sounds like the challenge would be lead finding. If you accept Medicare you could generate your own leads, but then you have to bite the Medicare bullet. Just my 2 cents.

> **Response 2:** Be very clear on what is therapy and what isn’t. That should help clarify everything.
A lot with PD have Medicare and will want to use that most likely. Just all how you market your services

I'm a physical therapist looking to connect with others who have partnered with gyms. I'm interested in learning more about how these relationships work, especially in regards to using gym equipment and bringing in non-member clients.

Questions:

How do you typically structure your partnership with the gym?
Are you allowed to bring in clients who are not members? If so, are there any restrictions or limitations?
Do you have to prioritize the gym's members over your own clients?
What are the benefits and challenges of partnering with a gym?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do not have a private practice but have been researching here and there for a few years. These are great questions, but unfortunately, the answer is not one-size-fits-all. In terms of amenities and business practices, things may differ between gyms, so it’s essential to know what you want for both your patients and your business.

Not allowing non-members would be a major red flag. Everything else can and should be negotiated.

If they want member priority, this could be harmful for growth, but you can counter with offering designated member-only times, discounted member rates, asking for lower rent, or requesting marketing support.

There is so much ambiguity in this aspect that it will be beneficial to know where you will excel and where you may struggle, so that you ensure the partnership is mutually beneficial and unlikely to lead to future tension.

Protect your brand and your values (this is your motivation and drive), ensure a contract is formed (with plenty of reflection and revision), have an exit strategy in writing, and build in a re-negotiation date at a certain checkpoint.

As for structure, the most common that you will see are flat rate rent, percentage of revenue, or a hybrid. If you expect very fast growth, then a flat rate may be optimal. If you expect slow growth, a percentage of revenue may be better. A hybrid offers them a guarantee while giving you protection if growth is slow.

You could offer a revenue cap where you pay a percentage of revenue up to a certain threshold, followed by a reduction in percentage — possibly even to zero. Another option is a tiered split, where the percentage decreases as your revenue increases.

> **Response 2:** Depends on your agreement/contract with gym. I like percent per visit (can be anywhere 10-30% depending on how everything is set up) rather than flat fee, this gives the gym incentive to send people your way.

Topic: SEOs / Google Search 

I just moved to a new state and launched my website, so I don’t get much visits (yet! 🤞), but I make sure every web page on the site has all the necessary keywords: biz name, our services, specialties, locations, contact info, and even my name. 

I can get my business’ name on the top of the first page on Google when people search it. The dilemma is when I search physical therapy + our city. The business doesn’t even show up in ANY of the pages (even as far back as page 5+). My area is pretty small and there’s no other provider within 25 mi from me, but the top hits are practices outside of my radius.

I’ve spoken to local businesses owners and none of them have paid for ads or search engine page boosts. I’m sure there’s a way then to be a top (non-sponsored) hit organically, that won’t take decades to achieve. 

So for those of you who have had success in this, how are you doing it? Any advice is appreciated! 🫶

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just like you expect someone to pay you for your expert services, pay someone that is an expert in SEO...it's worth the ROI

> **Response 2:** Is your Google Business profile updated? 

Did you update title tags and meta descriptions too? 

Jenny Gill is an OT and copywriter who is great with SEO. 

If there aren’t other providers in the area, I would t pay someone to keep changing your SEO. You should be able to rank. 

How long have you had the website listed in the new location? 

Is your business address still an old location in some other paperwork or something? Or maybe even in your privacy policy/terms & conditions page? 

Also, have you submitted your website to get re-crawled?

Hello, I received a referral from a Concierge MD to treat one of their patient for back pain. This is only the 3rd referral I have received from this MD. The pt was very nasty on the phone and stated she would not fill out any intake paperwork. Do I/Should I write to the referring MD and explain the situation and how this pt is not a good fit, or do I just let it go and not mention anything to the MD? 

In hindsight, this MD tends to send over very "high maintenance" people compared to other concierge MD I get referrals from.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would let the doctor know the patient declined services, or whatever happened and thank them for the referral.. so they don’t think you’re the problem and stop referring to you

> **Response 2:** Absolutely send a letter. 

The story the patient tells the doctor will be TOTALLY different and place you in a very magazine light I’m sure. 

People are weird 😉 
Our perceptions are wildly different from the same interaction.

1). Recommendations for best user friendly and low cost EMR service for record keeping

Any and all help is much appreciated!

Hi! My clinic is skilled OT/PT and wellness. I will be offering yoga, meditation, massage, etc. I do not want to track any of that on my EMR. I am looking for an app or a site where clients can go in pay for their class/package and show up to class. If you offer wellness services, what do you use to track and sell visits/packages.

I offer personal training as well as physical therapy for my
business. Should I document my personal training sessions?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** While not legally required to, I document a visit happened, and 2-3 sentences of what happened. 

Usually any major data points I have invented for the client: 30 min walking distance, weight vest laps around living environment, time to do complete 50 sit to stands, etc 

Main reason I do this is to be a better trainer and remember benchmarks as well as tax purposes to deduct driven miles for each session.

> **Response 2:** When I did personal training, I had a simple chart with all the exercises down the side and dates across the top. In each column, I recorded weight, #reps, time under load. ￼ at the very bottom of the column, you could write any significant notes (like where you focused on technique, tolerance, etc.).  This way you have a record and are tracking progress easily. ￼

Hello all. 

Looking for PTs in Detroit Michigan. 

I saw this post on one of FB groups. This woman is in her 50s and started lifting not too long ago. She said she had not so great experience with the previous PT. Hopefully this one will be much better!

Here is her post: 
"Some background & specs: 52, 5’6”, 130lbs. (This is the genetic body type of both sides of my family).  Type 2 Diabetes. Very sensitive to carbs and trying to manage blood sugar & menopause without medication & through fitness as much as I can (not against other options). History of frozen shoulder (completely healed at this point) and chiropractic issues that are manageable and come less frequently now. 

I’ve been working with a fitness trainer (male) who seems to “get it” and is open.  I have a chiropractor (male) who I’ve seen on and off for over 20 years. Has helped a lot and I respect his knowledge.  The book “Next Level” has inspired almost all the lifestyle changes I’ve made.  I was not an “athlete” before this book.  Very stagnant life before. Very weak. 

Began weight training in March 2023 after a 2month recovery from a slip n fall & minor car accident.  As of last week, I squat 95lbs and about 15-20lbs for most arm bb. (Still learning all the gym language.) my focus is to maintain a healthy fat/muscle ratio to manage blood sugar & train to manage menopause.  I feel great! Blood sugar down from 10 A1C to 7 A1C (hoping to get it lower). Very few menopause symptoms.  Still really carb sensitive so I don’t get all my carbs in daily, increased fat but not doing Keto. Shared my current macros. They are going up gradually to accommodate my blood sugar.  

(Feel free to offer any suggestions) 

My issue: last week I was doing pushups and pulled something in my neck.  Was having some same side lower back/hip pain during hinge exercises, too.  Saw the chiropractor who fixed the issue and said the following “With your posture and frame you should lift lighter with more reps(🙄). Don’t lift over head.  Do exercises that keep your chest open. Women over 50 are at higher risk for shoulder injury during weight training.” (Admittedly, was hoping for, you look great, posture is stronger…kudos, kudos, kudos)

I’m finding myself comparing all I’ve learned and experienced since picking up “Next Level.” Wanting to consider all the respected perspectives.  I know I have a long way to go. I’m still deciphering Dr. Stacy Sims recommendations and applying. 

I respect everyone’s experience and perspective here.  Hoping for information, perspective and inspiration that will keep me motivated and moving forward.  (Don’t worry, Ill take everything offered in context of it being FB) Thanks."

Any takers?

**Original Post:**
I'm in need of design-minded allies!
A good friend of mine offered to do my logo. I'm a Pelvic Floor PT running a cash -only practice out of my house. My name is Bottoms Up Pelvic Floor PT, and I thought that showed a bit of humor and relevance without being flippant. 
However - this logo is EXACTLY what I had in mind, but I'm finding that the actual two-dimensional image feels cartoonish, and doesn't really reflect the intimacy and seriousness of pelvic floor therapy. Especially pain and sexual dysfunction, which are my passion areas.
Is there a way to make a logo like this more... Appropriate? Do I need to abandon it altogether? If I abandon it altogether, any brilliant ideas about a motif that would be respectful of people's maladies and also relevant to the name of my business?

Thanks a million for your ideas!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just my 2 cents worth as a fellow pelvic PT: I'd go back to the drawing board, it is cute but might not communicate the message you intend. If I were having pelvic pain or sexual dysfunction, my first thought seeing the logo might be "um...am I gonna have to stick my butt up in the air"??? or "is this place a bar??" If you love your biz name and your current clients love it, great. But sometimes a fun name turns up not-so-fun stuff when doing a Google search for the same term...

> **Response 2:** I don't have any brilliant ideas, if one comes to me I will share it.

These do not speak to me at all I'm sorry to say. I agree that it lacks professionalism. 😕

**Original Post:**
What have you guys told patients when you are leaving a clinic to treat independently? 

I’ve kept it pretty vague, such as when my last day will be, who the therapist taking over is, etc, but I have quite a few patients who want to know where I’m going to keep treating with me. 
I know there’s basically the “no poaching” ethics and what not, but one of my patients said today that it’s his right to want to continue with a therapist that he trusts and sees results with. 
Having a hard time determining if I’m in the wrong bringing patients with me who have vocalized wanting to continue treatment with me, even if I wasn’t at this specific clinic anymore rather than switching to the new PT.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi all!
Thank you for all the feedback and suggestions. I had a conversation with our clinic owners and was told they have no issue with me sharing my professional email or social media with patients to ask questions/keep in touch, and if that leads to them choosing to treat with me then so be it. They did ask that I do not share specifics of my plan, such as treating mobile, etc, unless asked after my departure from the clinic, which I more than understand.
So for now, I will just be passing that info along, if asked, and keep advocating for the new PT coming in because he’s a great new grad with a lot of love for the profession🙂

> **Response 2:** Maybe I'm the odd one out here, but when I left my job to open my own practice I "poached" pretty much every one of my active patients. 
Context. I am a pelvic floor PT. I was honest with everyone that I was leaving on X date, and was leaving to start my own private practice. I didnt ask any of them if they wanted to come with me, but every single patient asked if they could continue their care with me at my new location. I gave them the option of staying at the current clinic and working with the other pelvic PT. Nope, no takers. If they asked directly, I just gave them my new contact info, and had them contact me later to schedule.  🤷‍♀️  Patients have the right to see what provider they want to see. As long as you are not going out of your way to market to old clients, or push it, they can come to you.

Michigan PTs, we have a chance at Direct Access, removing the prescription requirement.   Will you sign this letter asking our senators to support it (you must be a resident of Michigan)?    If you live in Michigan, will you share this link to the letter with friends, family, neighbors, patients?   Ask them to sign!   We need to get growing support.  
https://forms.gle/kNbb4D4CTRQfES1SA
Background:  The Senate Health Policy Committee is reviewing SB 668.  If they approve it, SB 668 will go to vote in the Michigan Senate.  if it passes, it has to go to the House for consideration.   Today, Friday 4/19 at 1:30 pm EDT, I am going to a Meet & Greet with MI Sen. Mark Huizenga to bring him my letter, signed by any Michigan resident who supports this.   If you LIVE IN MICHIGAN, will you electronically sign my letter asking the Senate Health Policy Committee to support SB668?   You must live in Michigan.  Upon electronically signing, please include your residence City, State and Zip.  

PLEASE, ONLY MICHIGAN RESIDENTS SIGN. 

Thanks, everyone.  The Uncaged Clinician will surely benefit from this, as patients often find us directly, circumventing the physician visit.

**Community Responses:**

He's always told me that they way I keep my books is up to me as long as he can make sense of it. I've used QB before but now use an old school excel sheet for sev businesses. I'd shop around. CPAs can cross state lines so you aren't locked in to local either.

> **Response 2:** I wish my CPA charged me only a grand.  I usually have to pay 2 1/2 times that.  $1k is a steal!

For those patients I gave them a robust HEP and checked in with them a month later and they were doing great and so I discharged them

Has anyone switched specialties? Then gone to cash based?
Backstory: I have my NCS and work primarily with PD in OP hospital setting. The past few years I’ve felt that I need something new or different. I’ve always toyed with the idea of postpartum Pelvic floor or Peds (even in PT school) but have NO experience with either, except having a baby and being a postpartum pelvic floor patient myself once. I know I can do cash with Neuro but idk if I really want to. In my area PD is mostly Medicare and idk if I want to get into the grey area of wellness to accept cash from them. 
To be clear, I wouldn’t switch specialties for the sole purpose of doing cash. But if I did switch, the cash model maybe easier because of the younger populations wouldn’t be mostly Medicare.
I guess I want something different, more autonomy, and of course to get out of corporate healthcare but not necessarily with my current population.
If you have any insight, advice, or experience, I’d appreciate it. And with no experience in either specialty, where do you start?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you're switching to cash then you need to know what you're doing and be highly skilled in that field. If you are going after a niche then you need to convince people to choose you over others, and that your care is worth them foregoing the use of their insurance. Until you have found what you offer that is better than any other, then I wouldn't switch.

> **Response 2:** I don’t think it needs to be one or the other. There can be a continuum. 

It sounds like you want to break ties with your old identity and it’s easiest for you if the day to day looks different with a different patient population. If YOU need that then switch and send it.

Hey Uncaged Community! I’m looking for the wisdom of the SPORTS/ORTHO/RUNNING EXPERTS in this group! I received this text from a friend who is a long-time runner, triathlete, and Physician’s Assistant. Any advice? I’d love to connect her with anyone who offers virtual services/consults/advice and can help! She is located in Virginia.

“If it’s okay, I was hoping to pick your brain a bit? (Before I panic).

I ran my first race since my stress fracture almost 2 weeks ago now (April 23rd- 🎉) 9 months post stress fracture. I felt great, no pain, legs were just pretty sore the next day thanks to some tough hills.  

I got sick about mid week after my race, and still am currently sick (I believe they’ve lovingly called this runners flu)… I have been laid up since then feeling super run down and haven’t been able to run or really workout- trying to be smart and listen to my body. 

Earlier this week, my ankle started really bothering me- just some deep achy/annoying pain… and worse at night. Which raised some flags for me. The weather has been yuck so I attributed it to that at first. But the rainy/storms have passed and I’m still having a constant nagging ache. Worse when I’m just sitting and still worse at night. 

Have you ever heard of illness triggering that same “flare” of an old injury like weather does ? Or do you think it might be more cause for concern to check in/follow up on? 

It just doesn’t make sense to me. I felt great during my race and over a week past that I felt good and then all of a sudden it starts giving me trouble when I’m not even exercising…”

Thanks, ya’ll! ☺️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I agree that she should probably have it re-imaged to r/o stress fracture recurrence, but the fact that it is happening primarily when she is NWB and at the end of the day makes me think that there is also a possible referral from the spine or hip instead of pain from stress fracture. That deep, achey, can’t-be-touched pain could be from irritated neural or nerve-adjacent tissue. Or just muscular fatigue from possibly not ramping back up appropriately. 
I am also in VA and I offer free consultations online. They are welcome to book one of interested.

> **Response 2:** Immune system CAN flare symptoms in old injury site, but given she hasn't been training makes it hard to believe a new stress fx has developed. Imaging would rule out serious pathology, but I'm more inclined to believe a lumbar referral pattern or even local peripheral nerve issue. I'd figure out what nerve is in that area and try neurodynamics

Hey everyone! I got an interesting request from a potential prospective patient. Curious if anyone has done this before and if so, any suggestions? We are 100% cash based. 

Here is the question: “Because my injury was caused by a different party, I am working with an attorney in a settlement with the other party. While the settlement is being discussed, I am looking for a physical therapist who is willing to work with me on a lien-basis with my attorney’s office until the settlement is reached, as I do not have medical insurance.”

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Usually takes a long time to get paid from those and they usually will negotiate rates after the case settles.  I would ask if they can pay up front and then they can reimburse themselves with the money from settlement.

> **Response 2:** I have really close friends that are personal injury lawyers. They want to send me patients with liens but I’ve been super up front with them: $150 per visit or I’m out. They haven’t been able to guarantee that once. They also won’t agree to paying up front.

What is your opinion of putting prices for services on your website? Good idea or not a good idea. I have mixed opinions because some people may be scared of the price and not inquire at all- but we’ve also been getting people contacting us trying to negotiate a lower rate. 

And what is your opinion on a set rate, but also offer a sliding scale for those in financial difficulties so we can help more of the population?

Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am honestly less likely to schedule with a person who does not have prices listed. Unless there is something else on the website that makes me think that I will not find a better place, I will not even contact. I am not more likely to schedule with someone if I have to contact them for prices. A price will turn me away if too high no matter if I have to contact them or not. Just my personal opinion, but that doesn’t mean it’s the majority’s opinion.

> **Response 2:** I don’t have my prices directly on my website but have a button that takes me to my booking site which shows my prices right away. I had the same thoughts as you about putting them on my site. I think it’s just your preference.

Patient care question for the group. Have a 79 year old women as a patient right now who is going on 6 weeks now of having a 8-10/10 pain that affects most of her right side from her rib cage down to her glutes (described as burning with shooting bouts of pain). 

We just started PT 2 weeks ago (she was undergoing testing by primary MD - X-rays and US without significant findings other than some OA) and have only been able to meet once due to scheduling conflicts. 

She struggles to do even very basic movements including seated flexion, side bending to open up space on the right side, and ant / post pelvic tilts in standing as she cannot tolerate any other positions. Tissue including glutes and paraspinals are very sensitive to touch. Lumbar ROM reveals increased pain with motions closing down space on facet joints on the R side but doesn’t recreate pain in rib cage / thoracic pain. Central and unilateral PAs reproduce some but not all of the areas of pain on the right side radiating into glutes between L3-L5. 

She does have a history of RA but mostly in her hands and has not had recent blood work. does anyone have experience with RA flare ups in the spine? She was on a steroid pack about 4 weeks ago which helped at the time but the pain returned shortly thereafter. 

I’m worried she is going to become reliant on pain medication / push towards a chronic pain state if this pain level continues to persist for too much longer.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This pain is not mechanical.  Have her see a rheumatologist

> **Response 2:** Hate that she is going through this! What did she have an US of? If this was my patient, maybe after 1-2 more in person visits, I would look at obtaining MRI or PET scan. Concerned if I am unable to recreate the pain with testing or alleviate pain with positioning or manual work. Rule out worst case scenario which could be cancer,  lower lobe, kidney￼￼? Hope this helps! Good luck

2) Does anyone have recent fee schedules for commercial insurances for IL they can share with me? Trying to decide who (if any) to accept 

Thanks!

Not PT related, and not looking for medical advice. Just a general question: is shin pain common with growing pains? My oldest son will be 10 in Aug, and is on the small side so I’m expecting a growth spurt soon. He’s very active and pretty much never complains about pain, but was in tears this morning telling me he’s had shin pain for “weeks”. Apparently it’s inconsistent, not worse at night or with activity. I never had growing pains, so I have no idea, and I always have an underlying and probably unreasonable fear of osteosarcoma.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Could be shin splints.  I had that as a teen.  Horrible pain.  There is taping to help try YouTube and see if that helps

> **Response 2:** My son had horrible growing pains. His dad also had Osgood -Schlatters in his middle school years and had horrible pains. Might look into a cho-pat brace to wear with activities, it might offer some relief. Always good to have him checked out.

It feels like nearly half of the posts in this group are about how to get new patients

Why not turn to the people who already **trust** you, have already seen **results** and have already given you **money**, and increase their lifetime revenue?

Tomorrow night (May 11 at 8pm EST) CJ and I are going to hosting a workshop all about how to do exactly that

How to avoid that thing you hate, **selling**, and just extend the value you are already providing to your people

It takes less time out of your schedule than you think, and once you realize the amount of money it can bring to your practice, you'll be excited to get started!

Hi all, I am totally cash-based, but previously worked at clinics that billed insurance. I got a call from BCBS because they still had me as a PPO provider. They thought I needed to reimburse the patient and bill through BCBS. When I explained what I do, she told me I needed to “de-par” with BCBS and gave me a number to call. 

Is this true? Anyone else done this? I’ve not heard of it before. I opened a year and a half ago

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yeah... I had this happen to me. They had actually sent the payment for my patient to the other clinic. My patient told them she was pissed because this is a hipaa violation because now that clinic has her medical info. They were clearly concerned because she got her reimbursement check 3 days later (vs typical 45 days). Anyways, they sent me some form to fill out, and it's never happened since. 

Someone mentioned being linked to EIN, but despite having clearly different EINs, they said in the system it's still linked via NPI. Interestingly it happened out of the blue with 2 patients in a row but never an issue for the years prior.

> **Response 2:** Yes. Sometimes with bcbs if you are contracted through an old job you need to call and have that cancelled.

Billing question.  The only insurance I accept is medicare, and have had no issues with being paid by secondaries.  I just spoke to BCBSFL after getting 20 claim denials for secondary patient from the same patient.  They said they don't pay out of network benefits with this plan.  I was under the belief that if Medicare pays, then the secondary has to pay.  Does anyone have information on this?  I am not really set up to have time to call everyone's secondaries before they come in to see if they are in our out of network.  Thanks for any help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Supplement is different than secondary

Some secondaries (PPO) will pay the remaining 20%. Other secondaries (HMO) will not. 

True secondaries are generally few and far between but you need to know what you’re looking for on the card. Those are the ones where you call or look up benefits so you get ahead of things like this.

> **Response 2:** If the secondary doesn't pay, patient gets a bill and a super bill and they can follow up.  Not my insurance, not my problem. Says right on my website I am out of network for everything but Medicare and I make no guarantees when asked.  They are welcome to call before scheduling but I'm out of network to avoid all that BS so not calling anyone or filling out anything.

*Please delete if post not allowed 

Sorry for the long post. I have a personal question but figured people here would be most knowledgeable. Can we bill for indirect care? I was under the impression we cannot as it’s not direct contact. I‘m in California.

Background:
Im taking my kid to a multidisciplinary peds center (offering PT, OT, SLP) and they gave me the following information. They’re charging me for notes? We’re also only getting one therapy service and won’t have a team. 

Edit: They are in-network with my PPO and accept other insurance. No Medicaid, I don’t know about Medicare 

“Examples of indirect care include meetings where members of the child’s treatment team discussed the child’s progress in their treatment plan, as well as the creation of progress reports. If the child’s treatment program is funded by a program that allows us to bill for indirect care, then the client is not responsible for the cost-share associated with indirect care. However, if they do not cover indirect care ** Therapy will bill you directly.
The explanation of benefits (EOB) that you receive from your insurance provider may shows that they had paid for dates of service where the client did not have any direct interaction with the treatment team. If a client’s insurance benefit is canceled and the client does not inform ** Therapy of the benefit cancellation, then the client or legal guardian will be responsible for payment of the direct and indirect care that is not covered by the insurance provider. Therefore, it is very important that you inform ** Therapy immediately if the client’s benefit is canceled. If ** Therapy services are self-funded, then the child or legal guardian is responsible for payment of all direct and indirect care.”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** While not quite the same thing, my daughter’s endocrinologist charges $200/year to cover dealing with the prior authorizations and letters of medical necessity. I don’t think it’s ethical but don’t think it’s technically illegal

> **Response 2:** I know some offices charge the client/patient for reports. But cms/regulators has a max amount cap, like no more than $1/page, idk how much it is nowadays. 

The consult package, poc, progress note, discharge report all sounds like the CPT codes on super bills. They are trying to guarantee payments received, if not billed otherwise. 

But! If they are in network with your insurance and they confirmed that you have insurance, legally, according to cms, they cannot charge you these, they have to bill to your insurance & you can appeal their decisions too.

**Original Post:**
UPDATE: 

Just found out the payer has been sending payment to another PT group because the practitioner’s NPI is associated with that group as well (she works there prn). Has anyone encountered this?  I am at a loss for how to fix this.  

———————

One of our cash-pay clients has been submitting self-claims for reimbursement.  His insurance is BCBS Federal.  He has yet to receive any reimbursement.  Today he was told by his insurance company that "because the NPI is on the superbill, payment was sent to the PT practice..." (it wasn't); and, "the PT practice will need to reimburse you for these funds and there's nothing else we can do for you."  Basically, they have told him (falsely) that we, the PT group, have been receiving reimbursement for his already-paid-for cash services.  Except we haven't received a dime!  It's so ridiculous that I don't know who to call in order to straighten it out.  Plus, I don't have time to be on the phone arguing this as a solo practitioner / owner.  Has anyone else dealt with this?  Honestly, every self-claim attempt my patients have made, regardless of payer, has led to some level of headache and frustration for both the patient, and for me.  It's maddening.  Any advice appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have the patient ask for the check number and payment date.

> **Response 2:** Possible that they have/will sent paper checks and you are yet to receive. I would call and talk to the provider/claims department and get more info first and foremost to find out what’s going on. They are a big company and typically helpful via customer support. It will get sorted out.

Second, sounds like it may be worth your while to learn how to submit OON claims on behalf of your patients. It is a nice service to offer, very easy, and can probably increase your revenue long term and eliminate a lot of these headaches you describe.

We file out of network for some clients but usually most clients pay prompt pay discount and self submit superbill. We recently had an insurance where their OON deductible was only $200 so we filed for them and they only pay about $26 per visit which is no where near what we were expecting. How would you/have you handled with a current patient on caseload? 
1. Just have all patient self submit superbills although some insurances do pay well OON so may miss out on some additional $
1. Have them sign something similar to an ABN if courtesy billing OON and letting them know they will be responsible for any unpaid CPT codes up to the prompt pay discount? Is this balanced billing if the insurance is completely not paying for CPT codes like 97110 even with GP mod, etc. 
1. Other recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** #compliance - Crystal - many factors at play, including each insurance plan's coverage of OON benefits. Of note, there are issues of balance billing, and legal requirements of the Good Faith Estimate that come into play. (Does your website provide the mandatory notice of the "Right to A Good Faith Estimate"?)  

Not "legal" advice .... but may assist in your risk assessment moving forward....

> **Response 2:** It sounds like this ins.(hmo) is processing this claim in network.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** My billing/office manager did this for me because she was a natural. We defined what a “contact” was and she was paid for each as well as receiving a bonus for each new referral received within a specific time period. She tracked all of it and I verified it. It was a win-win. If my therapists went out to do an event, a lunch and learn, shadowed a physician, etc, they were paid regular hourly rate or salaried as professionals should be….same for on-boarding. Edited to add that I constantly reminded my therapy and non-therapy staff that EVERY encounter with a patient, referral source or community member was an important “marketing” opportunity.

Google voice users:
I currently receive my personal and business numbers through my cell. I recently brought on  a receptionist and we are trying to figure out how to use her own phone to handle calls I can forward incoming calls to her, but she has to use my phone to make calls or view texts. Is there a way to use the same number through both phones without setting her up for an additional number?  Which would defeat the purpose. 
Ideally, we'd like to set up a phone dedicated to the clinic, but this is the current situation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just moved my phones to GoHighLevel.  
Can forward the phone to ring where you want, outgoing calls/texts all from the work line + the calls are time/date stamped & can be recorded for review.

> **Response 2:** You have to be in the same Google account as her.

I’m using godaddy for my website because it seemed like one of the cheapest options. Is it worth paying extra for SEO? Any opinions on godaddy vs other options?

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love what Fitzherbert Harry said 👌👍
Going off of that, BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS with people may serve you a gracious plenty.  

At the end of the day, it’s still far more valuable for your business to learn how to have conversations and develop relationships.  

SEO is great.  But don’t hide behind that.

> **Response 2:** Hi Amy, I use goDaddy. Did the website myself. I know it could use tweaking and to be easier to navigate but honestly, it’s really more my digital business card more than anything else. I don’t pay for SEO. Or haven’t yet anyway. Google my business is key. It’s free and getting reviews, responding to them and posting photos and things on there is key. I get calls all the time and they say “I googled and found you and your reviews are amazing” I wouldn’t spend money on the website SEO…. Too many  better places to spend IMO

**Want to know** **when I *REALLY* started loving what I do?**

I have always loved being a therapist.  I seriously don't think that there is anything else that I would do.

Yes, I experienced burnout and all of that other stuff that perhaps many of you have experienced, or are experiencing now.

When I started my own practice in 2013, I finally felt free.

But do you want to know what changed everything for me?

Want to know how I managed to get to where I am today?

Simple, really.

I did two things.

I started investing in myself with coaching.

I started attending LIVE events.  

Not your typical national association conferences.  But true LIVE events- the kind where everyone there was hungry for something different.

Everyone there knew that the status quo just wasn't going to cut it; nor was it going to take them to where they wanted to go.

The energy and momentum that came from those events were immense.

But that's not all that I got from these LIVE events.

Perhaps the greatest gift and value that I received - which skyrocketed me - was the COMMUNITY that was created at each event.

Better yet, it was the FAMILY that bonded us all.

Many stressors that I had suddenly went away, because I had found a family that had my back.  

One with whom we shared ideas - none of which were bad ideas. 

We supported each other.  We encouraged each other.  

Everyone inspired by everyone else.

It was from the same coaching program and LIVE events where I was blessed to have crossed paths with Josh Payne and Kevin DeGroot, both who are now my business partners.

I would venture to say that each of them would credit the investments that they made - and that we have made together - as keys to their successes.

And now, we want nothing more than for YOU to join us in experiencing *community*.

*And to find your family.*

We invite you to commune with us this **Oct 6-9 in Denver, CO**. for the 2nd annual UNCAGEDLIVE22

This event is for PT's, OT's, respective assistants, Chiros, SLP's, LMT's, and more.

To learn more about **UNCAGEDLIVE**, click on the link in the comments below!

We already have more than 100 family members attending!  We want you to come with us!

(Oh, and in case you're wondering.  We have coaching programs for the new and existing practice owners.  We would love to talk to you about them!)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So pumped for this event, and the community that is being built!  #uncaged #uncagedlive2022 #community

> **Response 2:** Don’t miss out on this one

Does anybody use an app or anything to keep track of the random tasks that come up? Right now we use just paper and highlight when things get done. But obviously my co-owner and I both can't see what is done unless we meet. Just want to make our lives easier in the long run. 

Also. Thanks for everyone's input on my last post about a month ago. Was losing my mind. Busy! Which is great! But so stressed out with all the random day to day, month and long term tasks that I was losing my mind.

**Community Responses:**

Happy Tuesday everyone! 

Just doing a little updating on procedures around the office and making check lists/how to lists in preparation for hiring an office manager! 

When it comes to creating a paper chart for patients to keep on record what all do you put in yours?

What are some other things that would be good to make ”how to” cheat sheets for them to refer back to?

Chart audit check list?
Submitting claims ?

Let me know! TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Basic contact info, signed policies and procedures, HIPAA, consent signatures. Copy of DL & insurance cards. I can send you my original paper intake paperwork that I made from David with uncaged and my revised versions from my billing team! 🥰

WebPT makes a patient onboarding checklist that is handy for gathering all needed info! 

I would also recommend typing out example verbiage for them to follow when answering phone calls, scheduling, new patient onboarding so they sound professional and hit all the major things while on the phone!

Happy to send you copies of any of my papers ❤️

> **Response 2:** Nope. No paper. Scan. Shred.  Cloud.

Has anyone created an app? There are so many options out there; any insight to what you used would be helpful! Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What all do you want the app to do? I used PT Wired and have really loved the results.

> **Response 2:** Completely depends on what job you want the app to solve. We built our own EMR application, Embark EMR , using a system called caspio. Caspio provides a HIPAA compliant database and security infrastructure, connected with a (fairly) simple development environment. However, for the HIPAA compliant database and security system, it does cost about $10,000 per year.

Anyone using Jane app? 

If so, what ￼￼do you like or not like about it? It looks and sounds like a great platform from others I’ve spoken to who use it.

I’m seriously ￼￼considering switching over to them since I’m having major issues with current EMR. 

Happy Friday!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love it and my patients all rave about using it. I don’t do insurance so can’t speak to that piece. But I specifically got because it does so much for me that I don’t have time for/adhd wise it’s too overwhelming so I absolutely love it. I link the payments, i click click click and Superbills are sent. Can upload files in hippa compliant manner. Only downside is you can’t fax - which I rarely need but it would be nice and easy

> **Response 2:** I use it and love it. I agree with everything above. I also really love how customizable notes are - you can make your templates exactly like you want them, and add anything extra you need on the fly during the visit - but without being clunky. I’ve used WebPT at a previous job and you could always add areas to type, but it was so clunky and ugly. On that note - that is one of my favorite things about janeapp - it’s pretty. I probably shouldn’t care about that, but I do, and I appreciate that they care about it too.

Hi again - the patient I posted about the other day saw the surgeon today. TKA July 21st. Lacking 10-12 degrees extension and has ~100 degrees flexion. 

Surgeon said he is doing good and no manipulation needed 😳

Should he get a second opinion?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is he able to take NSAIDs? I’ve had issues with patients with cardiac histories who aren’t able to take NSAIDs making it tough to manage swelling and pain

How do you guys hire/find new PT's? I live in a smaller town, close to a huge city, about an hour away. But If I could, I could hire 4-5 more PT's based on how busy we are. But It is so hard to find anyone right now. I've done job fairs but that's more long term Investing In hiring someone.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Do you take students?  That might be a nice way to train and recruit future therapists get awareness for your practice.

> **Response 2:** When recruiting therapists, no matter where, active recruiting is a must. 

So not just posting a job and hoping/waiting for applicants. Getting a licensure list from your state which usually will include emails (and hopefully phone numbers), emailing, texting, calling to those is the zip codes close to you. 

Posting on social media/linkedIn. 

Get in touch with the local PT schools in your area and try and connect with those last year PT students. 

Differentiating your job when you post it. Highlight the reasons someone would want to work for you. Also don’t list every duty/the entire job description in the post. It’s not necessary and no one reads it. 

It’s so important to get back to applicants the same day and set up an interview asap. Then make a decision quickly.

Question: How would you start pre gait training on a 55 y/o male TBI patient with s/p pelvic fx and TTWB on R and only spontaneous movement on L LE? B radial fx with ability to use platform walker and WB through forearms.  Intermittently follows commands only.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** TTWB isn’t realistic in a patient unable to consistently folllow commands. Wait until he is cleared for WBAT or cognitive level improves enough for him to adhere to wt bearing status. Focus more on transfers, balance, strength etc…

> **Response 2:** In this situation I think pre gait activities for me would be to work on PNF patterns on the L LE to try and improve the muscle control, seated and supine exercises to strengthen the  R LE for when approved to WB fully. Balance in sitting, bed mobility, wheelchair mobility, participation in slide board transfer

**Original Post:**
For PT’s who do diagnostic ultrasound. Do you charge separately for that? Do you offer those services to local sports teams if they need a quick ultrasound post injury to potentially diagnose something?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I charge as an adjunct to an initial evaluation. Do your ortho or rheum style exam to get a hypothesis list and use the most sensitive tests you can to whittle that list down. Once your list is more appropriate after the objective exam, add in the US for a specific exam with a write up of findings. 

If insurance that you are contracted with doesn’t cover it then charge separately. If you have your RMSK you should not be charging under $100 for that service.

If I had time I would offer to local sports teams, but all of my kids play sports and I’m always on the sideline with one of my portable units in case of an injury and they know it. It’s a helpful screening tool to determine necessity for PT and referrals.

> **Response 2:** Check your state practice act to confirm scope of practice.

Going to speaking at a senior center  near my facility. Was looking for ideas besides a talk on falls. Any other good topics. Will be given 15-20 minutes to talk.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Teach them some easy chair stretches or chair yoga moves.

> **Response 2:** How to use floor transfers as exercise for flexibility and strength. Footwear, off the shelf orthotics and ankle ROM as balance strategies and how they relate for fall prevention. Great Seninars teaches a 14pt assessment called the AFit which can be used to give great feedback on posture, ROM, strength, etc. Great place to begin.

Dry needling experts....

What is the research/your clinical experience on dry needling and knee pain in runners? Assuming that all the other bases are being covered as far as mobility, strengthening, running technique etc, is there value to doing dry needling in this population?

I would love to hear  more as I have no dry needling experience, ty!

I'm editing this for clarification. I'm NOT interested in doing this on a patient...I AM the patient in this case.  I am training for the New York City marathon and I've been having some knee issues lately.  So I wanted to learn more about the effectiveness of it for myself and I would go to someone who does it if it is worth my time.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It depends on where the pain is.  I’ve done guided needling for a while and you can pretty much cure symptoms and pathology if done correctly.  Working on producing the research to support this.  To answer the question, patellar issues, quadriceps tendon issues, capsular issues around the patellofemoral joint - all very amenable to dry needling. Can stiffen up partially torn ligaments as well (superficial ones).

Try it,  you should find some benefits.

> **Response 2:** I have found it very helpful, especially some areas that are hard to get to manually. Recently had someone with strained post tib and ran half marathon with no pain after one session of dry needling with estim. Obviously results aren’t always that quick, but I would also argue it would be harder for me to address manually and his race was 5 days after treatment. 
But also depends on state as NY doesn’t allow PTs to dry needle.

Can you legally treat a patient that is a resident in another state that is a student in the state you practice in??

I haven't ran into this situation yet!

I practice in Wisconsin and they are a student living in Wisconsin and employed in Wisconsin but again an Illinois resident.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you treating them in the state you practice/are licensed in? Then yes you can treat them. I assume they are of legal age or have a parent/guardian consent. It's about where YOU practice, not where the patient lives.

> **Response 2:** Yes. I have a patient now who resides in PA but has been traveling the country doing comedy. I’m treating her in IL in person. 

Also when I was a student in IA doing PT, I was an Illinois resident.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐔𝐍𝐂𝐀𝐆𝐄𝐃 𝐂𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐀𝐍 𝐒𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭 this past week in Franklin, TN was BAMFUEGO! 🔥🦁🤠

So awesome to have these practice owners come together to support one another as each worked through exercises to push their business forward in a way that 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙮 want to push forward.

I can’t describe it any better than what Laura McKaig, one of the members, had to say….

This is her testimony:

“#uncagedclinician  #successcouncil retreat: leveling up in our businesses, sharing our dreams/visions for future growth, fellowship over football, and of course eating! 
I've had a hard time allowing myself to really dream regarding my business, imagining its potential beyond what it is now. It's been a very hard year personally and professionally. So grateful to this group who I consider family, to give me a safe, non judgemental space to dream again, without shooting down my own ideas.”

Hello all! What do you recommend as a clinical certification to make you stand out when opening a practice? I’m an OT and have about 10 years of experience but I feel like home health has made me so bogged down by assessment visits I’m having a hard time getting back to the reason I became an OT which is the treatments and seeing patients progress! I have a background in neuro but I would love to branch out to strength training and fall prevention /longevity area. Any guidance would be appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wouldn't waste time or money on a clinical certification as your patients/clients/referral sources don't care about that. 

Invest in learning about: marketing, sales, automation.

> **Response 2:** I took the Modern Management of Older Adults 3-part certification series offered through the Institute of Clinical Excellence (PT on ICE).  It was a fantastic series that I really loved and would highly recommend.  OTs can take it as well.

I'm not sure how much a clinical certification actually means to the average potential client; however, I am planning to pursue the GCS for PTs because I want the knowledge.  I don't know if it will help to have those initials behind my name, but it won't hurt.  

So I think it really depends on what you want for yourself.  If you want a business where you are not really involved in patient care, then a certification probably won't make a difference.  If you want the knowledge, then do it for that reason.

1) Learn to ask for help. Do you have trouble in this area? Pride keeps us from growing our businesses to the fullest potential.

👉🏻The do-it-myself attitude is hurting you, not helping you. 

2) Learn to communicate effectively. When asked what do you do and why do you do it, do you have a compelling answer?

👉🏻If you don’t, this problem multiplies itself when you are leading a team. 

3) Learn to understand and be comfortable with your weaknesses. (Which yes, requires personal development)

People always preach on focusing only on your strengths…I think this advice can be harmful when trying to get your business to the next level. 

👉🏻Lots of times the main bottleneck in business is YOU as the leader.

What’s the deal with an NPI number? I’m in the process of leaving my current employer - last day first week of June. IS my NPI attached to my employer or do I take it with me?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following. I just gave notice at my corporate clinic yesterday and will be going off on my own 🤗.  

To clarify, I fill out an 855i to get my NPI switched over to myself? I would need to wait to do this until my last day at corporate (6/15), correct? 

Thanks for all of the help!

Any recommendations for PT malpractice insurance that isn’t HPSO?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** CM&F

I actually have HPSO. It’s more expensive.  But, at the end of the day it’s only a couple hundred bucks more - for the year.  And, honestly, when it comes time to renew, I don’t feel like messing with changing 🤣

ISO PT(s) in Cincinnati area, pref near Mason if possible or mobile would be amazing. Cash or insurance is fine.
- Adult female, 39, marathon runner with scapular trigger points, loves dry needling, is a DO with UC and will refer. 
- Her gymnast daughter, 11, no specific issue but is tight and has difficulty with form.
- Her husband, 40, who has issues with nocturia and has just been pushed on meds with no referral to a PT. 

Thanks!

I have a silly question.  I like to send out Christmas cards to my client list with a gift certificate, but since I have grown this is now becoming quite the process to get everything addressed and mailed out. Plus the cost of postage and the cards themselves.  Does anyone send out physical cards and if so is there a system that makes it easy to upload mailing info so you aren’t hand writing everything. I’d love to hear ideas for what you do to show your appreciation for your clients with the goal being to have it feel personalized but cost and time effective.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I started with my Mac book pro and it was great but got tired of having to connect to my hotspot when I just needed to get a quick note done. I was also wearing it out, the keys were falling off. I just got an iPad and a case that has a keyboard. I bought a data plan and that solves the connection problem. But I miss having more capability on the days I have a longer break between clients.

Quick question for those who work with those who have become injured playing pickleball? I do work with older clients but am not familiar with the game of pickleball. I'm seeing several groin injuries and am curious what I can do to help these folks reduce the risk of this injury. I believe there is tightness in the adductors and IR of the hips but want to be sure I'm not missing something else.Thank you for any help.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A big element I work on is footwork. Various foot work drills to help avoid the end ranges of motion during a game. 
…
We can’t change the 40 years of degeneration, but if we can help them move better within the a available range of motion maybe we can reduce the risk of injury.

> **Response 2:** I would say eccentric control of the adductors more than flexibility. There are lots of side to side motions. Think tennis but smaller movements. Lots of changing direction, reflex training, full body twists for swings, etc. Also I read somewhere that pickleball is one of the most "dangerous" sport in that there's the highest injury rate compared to#of players. I'm sure there's a caveat to that stat, maybe the highest rate in racket sports or something. Double check me on that. But there's definitely a huge patient population for us in pickleball!

I am a DME orthotic provider looking to partner with a physical therapist to add PT services to my clinic. I want to have the PT services as strictly private pay. However I am starting to question if I can do this since I have contracts with insurance for my DME services. I am especially wondering if this is true for Medicaid. The PT I have been talking to does have a Medicaid number, but does not have any contracts with the HMOs. Any thoughts or resources that I can turn to? I am in Wisconsin.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t specifically have the answer to this question but I’m a cash based PT in Neenah, WI and would suggest checking with APTA WI. The state conference is coming up in two weeks and may be a good opportunity to ask questions! It looks like we also have some mutual contacts if you’d like to connect as Fox Valley providers!

> **Response 2:** You cannot charge Medicaid patients cash for Medicaid covered services, in any state.

For those who run their PT practices out of other businesses like gyms, wellness facilities, chiropractic offices, etc,. what should I expect to pay to rent or lease space on a monthly basis? This would be very part time to begin - less than 15 hours per week. I know this will vary by location, but wanting some averages to go off of for negotiations.

Edited to add: this will be in the Midwest near Kansas City, MO. And a shared space not my own.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** RE is so location dependent that your best bet is to find out the local per sq foot rate is and go from there.

> **Response 2:** Another thing to consider is will the space be completely yours? So can you leave marketing materials up in the common area even when you are not there? Or is it a shared space that you will only be renting hourly/as needed? 

I recommend trying to negotiate an hourly rate or fixed lease amount instead of paying a percent of what you are making… the country club I rent from wanted me to do 70/30 with them but I asked for a fixed amount and they agreed to $650/month. I’m in California so this was very reasonable. I’m now making 8-10k a month so I definitely got the better end of the deal by not agreeing to go 70/30

Mobile PT providers: For Part B MCR do they HAVE to be seen in their home location or can they be seen for services at a location of their choice? For instance a gym they belong to, another location other than their specific home if their home isn't conducive for PT and they want to use you as their PT and not go to an actual Clinic, etc....

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They must be seen in their home for Medicare to cover the service.

> **Response 2:** Has to be their home or a clinic for Medicare to cover it.

Anywhere else is not a covered service. (Meaning you can charge your cash rate.)

I have a tax question. I have an LLC. I was told to file as an S-corp to maximize the tax benefit. Does anyone have any insight on this issue?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just met with accountant and learned a lot about this. Kicker is you must do payroll and have to pay yourself a “reasonable wage”. have to be much more tedious with book-keeping. If you file as S-corp, can’t go “backwards” to LLC but as LLC you can change to S-corp at anytime. As a newbie, I’m gonna stay LLC to keep it simple but if I ever have employees, will likely change to S-corp.

> **Response 2:** I was told that too everyone does that though wen they first start out u can always change it next year but supposedly more tax breaks and benefits... if u make under 40k a year they say it's better to be an LLC though

Does anyone know if you can see client with Medicaid for cash pay in Missouri. I am a pelvic floor PT and She is willing to pay the cash pay rate. I cannot find a Missouri Medicaid number where I can actually talk to a specific person.  All the numbers I call on their website are automated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't think PT is a covered benefit for adults via MO HealthNet. If not covered, yes, you can.

> **Response 2:** I finally got a hold of someone at Medicaid and in Missouri you can see patients with Medicaid in a cash based practice if they sign a document saying they are not using insurance and will pay fee for service.

Hello,

I have an opportunity to work in a gym but they suggested they would like me to bill through them which I said no to. I have a meeting with them next week and want to negotiate pricing/terms. Any suggestions or recommendations would be appreciated. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Tell them you can’t do a percentage or fee per client with them because of anti-kickback laws that could make it seem like they are referring people to you just to increase their profit rather than for the benefit of the client. 

Then pitch a sliding scale or flat rate rent that increases over time as you get established, with a cap.

> **Response 2:** I would suggest pushing to just pay a rental fee, otherwise that it would make it very complicated for your business moving forward if you ever went separate ways

I approached a community center to use a portion of their pool to see patients for aquatic therapy. They are asking for 30% of revenue.
1) is this legal in healthcare, to pay a portion of revenue, especially if any of their members were to come to me for treatment?
2) is it just me or is 30% ridiculously high?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 30% is fairly standard. 20-40% is normal range, but can go to 50/50 even depending on what's included etc.

> **Response 2:** It can depend on your state. In some places it's not legal for them to charge you more than what would be considered a reasonable lease rate, in those states a percentage could get the facility in trouble. Some places charge providers a flat fee per hour with a monthly capped charge.

There is a shortage of PTs and PTAs, can I hire an athlete trainer, pilates instructor and Bill it under thera ex? I know with medicare that is unacceptable but can I do that with BCBS, Aetna? Humana? United health care?

I'm 46 yrs old, when did it change? Back in the days a massage therapist would do the exercise or massage since the PT had a patient every 30 minutes?

I'm a lymphedema and pelvic therapist now so I always get 1 hr one on one time so I was not aware of the changes

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I realize this is a legitimate question so I hope my answer is well received. 
Please do not hire and bill therapy procedures for an individual who is not a licensed and qualified PT or PTA. In the past I fought long and hard to keep said skilled services under the “PT only” domaine.  
Thank you.

> **Response 2:** If you are billing for skilled PT, that means a licensed PT or PTA.

And …. Let’s hear what this means to you in relation to the “evolution” of PT over the last …50 years…. And GO!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That we (therapists) are no longer the ones who decide what a patient’s potential is and facilitate the realization of that potential. We now often give them treatment to address where they are and pass them to a different level of care. The result is that many patients don’t reach their full recovery potential. Bad for them. Bad for us.

> **Response 2:** Every new grad (and especially seasoned PTs who know better) who works for a “PT Mill” with unrealistic productivity demands is making it harder for all of us to push back against exploitation and protect the integrity of our profession.

Until we come together as a majority to refuse unreasonable conditions, nothing will change.

I left in network care years ago but it took years of building credibility and experience (and feeling the burnout) in network to make the leap.

What is the easiest way to create an Amazon link that lists all of the products I recommend to patients, just to streamline things?  

Right now I look up whatever they need and send them the Amazon link during the visit.  Because I also do personal training I am recommending more and more equipment, and sometimes might recommend multiple items, since most of these clients work out at home. 

I am looking into the Amazon Associate program, but thought that they changed their rules a while back allowing you to send the link out via text and email, and not just from your website? 

Otherwise I'll just make a Google doc with links to all of the items and call it a day. 

Always striving to be more efficient so if you have any knowledge on this I would appreciate it, thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Just got setup as amazon associate and using link tree, pretty painless! Associate, affiliate, and influencer are all different things so that was the hardest part of getting setup was figuring out what to go with or what i was approved for

> **Response 2:** Generally, you can create a wish list and add products to it to keep them all organized in one spot. But if you want to earn commissions on the items, apply for the affiliate program and then you would create an “idea list” and add products to that and put a link to that list on your FB/insta business pages or website and you could direct people to those places to click the link to your recommended products. You can share your affiliate link on each individual item with clients but there was a rule that you couldn’t send the affiliate link directly through text. It might have changed to allow that now, not sure. The client had to go to your business page and go through the link from there.
You have to disclose that you earn commissions as an affiliate. You can check mine out on my business FB if you want. Stretch PT and Wellness ATL

So... you play the marketing game to a select few local MDs, discuss things with the MA/front desk, have a good face to face with the doc, hear "yeah, this is great, we'll refer some your way," then you NEVER HEAR ANYTHING.

I know it's all about building relationships, but what specifically is the next step? Try to hit the front desk again? Show up unexpectedly and drop off more pens? Let it go and bug another clinic?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t have great luck with marketing to physicians. For me, joining networking groups and building relationships is where I’ve found success!

> **Response 2:** Bear with me…. I’m I’m totally serious: are you taking good donuts?

The return on investment of donuts is pretty incredible. 

Look, they’ve got pens. And-post its.

They want / appreciate good quality donuts (Not Dunkin, never Dunkin).

Personal experience?  A dozen donuts gets you a referral.

But when you are there, are you spending most of your time talking about the business? Or are you shooting the shit with them (sorry: I didn’t have another phrase): talking about their kids? Last nights ballgame? Going huntin’? Everyday conversation
To get to know them? 

They don’t care about that last course you went to or if you do this new thing with backs. It’s about building relationships. And getting to know THEM (doc, nurse, front desk…do not ignore AT All the front desk.) . Front desk is the key.

Who is attending CSM in San Diego?
We are sponsoring a house on Coronado Island for our current therapists. 
It’s a good opportunity to expand our network, so I am hoping to meet up with new therapists interested in working within our proven model. 
Please use the link, if you’re interested in an informal “meet and greet” at the “CPT beach house”.  
FYI- we are very selective in our approach to new relationships or partnerships.



**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What a neat business model you have going here! 

It seems like a bridge between the standard employee setup and flying totally solo starting your business. Is that right Bryan Williams? 

I love seeing all the different models and outside the box thinking that clinicians are doing! 💪🏼 🤩

> **Response 2:** I’m not able to attend the meet and greet but I’m curious about your offer. Are the sessions with the patient to be done in person or virtual?

I’m really starting to get frustrated with my current EMR. I’ve tried to stick with it and be patient, but lately the issues we’re running into are taking months to resolve. I’m nervous about switching, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s time.

For those of you who’ve made the leap, what ultimately made you decide to switch? Any advice or things you wish you knew before changing systems?

What system did you change from and too and was it worth it? 

Costs are big thing as I am a soleproneur but saving time is also key.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use hello note. Very inexpensive and customer service is on top of it with any issues. Not a lot of problems and very user friendly. Also has a billing platform built in.

> **Response 2:** We switched from WebPT to Prompt. WebPT became too glitchy with lost documentation in the middle of a note, at one point frequent outages which may now be fixed. 
We are with Prompt now, I wish I would have looked at more but the ease of documentation was unmatched. It is more expensive, with hidden “add on” purchases including an automatic fax button at the end of notes. But at the end of the day, the transition was smooth. Very user friendly. And therapists are happy with the features. The billing system is very user friendly. 
May consider switching to something cheaper in the future.

I’d love to hear any ideas for Christmas gifts for PTs on your team! (I have one PT who works a few hours a week, and would like to spend around $100).   Because of other time commitments, a nice dinner or company outing/ experience isn’t in the cards for them, otherwise that would be my first choice. 
Thank you!!

(I give a check for other occasions through the year, so loooing for gift ideas rather than money)

**Community Responses:**

Hey all, I would love some advice, feedback on a current patient (one of my business's biggest cheerleaders) as I'm developing my ortho spine/pelvis knowledge and skills (I'm mainly neuro).  I am aware that MRIs are not always needed/necessary, etc, but I did attach the last half of an MRI for extra info.
Patient a 76 yo female, hx CVA w/ very mild right spasticity 1 year ago, has been practically pain free (orthopedically) for years.  107 lbs, eats as healthy as able.  She does have a noticeable dextroscoliosis of her lumbar spine.  Over the last month or 2 she has developed pain in right buttock, occasional n/t down lateral right leg with insidious onset.  She has had massages, chiro decompression, estim, manipulation (they sold her quick after her seeing her xrays), and will attempt dry needling tomorrow.  Everything feels better then comes back, but she's also taking max tylenol and now gabapentin daily.  She is mainly seeing me for balance, but we've tried manual therapy, exercises, etc and her pain does not seem to be improving.
I welcome any and all thoughts on other ways to assess, and help her reduce her pain.  Feel free to private message me
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** As already written, had a pt whose pain didn’t resolve until the cyst was removed. My other thoughts are along with strengthening of hips, gluts and core she would likely benefit from manual LE distraction and self decompression. My experience with stenosis is distraction over time has a cumulative effect and then follow up with home decompression program. I like to use Sara(h) Meeks. She’s a PT that developed a program to decompressed the spine, mainly for those dealing with osteoporosis where certain movements should be greatly limited or avoided. Had very good success with it (like doing it for myself sometimes).

> **Response 2:** May be hard to get good strength testing because of stroke but how is that L5 myotome? There are times where symptoms match with MRI and give a better idea of the problem.

I’ve been out of outpatient for so long that I’ve lost so much of my knowledge and skills.

Any recommendations for online classes to get me started?!

I’m considering switching from OP to HH to have more time to work on my side gig. 

I’m wondering if there is anyone else that took this route and have any tips or advice on taking this path

Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Is the side gig in healthcare? How much actual extra time are you needing? I wasn’t attempting to grow a side gig when I tried HH from OP but I fell for the “much more free time” or “schedule your time off”. I just found myself either making up for that time off on another day & as far as free time I found myself working way more from home on documenting then I wanted. & then making calls & scheduling is a whole other headache. Not trying to discourage you just giving my experience on trying HH 😅..I lasted two months then went back to OP

> **Response 2:** I was OP, then had a baby and switched to HH 2 decades ago. Last year I went back to OP, but may eventually wander back into HH for the flexibility and money. I wanted a mental challenge by going back to OP (boy, did I get one!) but also was missing camaraderie as HH is very isolating. OP these days is so much more of a grind, and everyone is so stressed. Our clinic has staggered lunches so fun interactions are minimal. HH can be overwhelming (as any new setting would be), but being one on one is such a blessing. Just know that motivation to improve is often much less in HH; many of those folks are fine to be completely sedentary and never perform an HEP, as long as they can make it from the recliner/bed to the toilet/bsc. Good luck! There are definitely advantages to both settings!

Good afternoon! A couple of questions for your minds:

1) Suggestions for income streams while a person builds their mobile practice and gets it running? My concern is that with a full-time job it would be hard to find “normal” days/hours for the new business. At the same time, I have a family to help support. Any thoughts on working home health full- or part-time? I’m coming from years in outpatient ortho. 

2) For those who have gone through the Uncaged program to help build and launch, what helped you decide to go this route vs other programs? I can think of three other programs/coaches, and am definitely a “paralysis by analysis” type.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Happy to have a call with you to talk about how UNCAGED CLINICIAN can help you. No hard selling or pressure

> **Response 2:** I really felt like the Uncaged program gave me exactly what I needed to understand and be effective in marketing.  I am not a paralysis by analysis type, I like to jump in and experience things.  But it really gave me the foundation to build my business and to feel like I can go forth and do anything.  The guys are all really great and you couldn't find more trustworthy people to work with

After years of trying to DIY my KPI and create spreadsheets to magically forecast profit and asses impact of changes to my practice…it’s come to my attention that there are business intelligence softwares that do this for you #MindBlown … I’m just starting the 10,000 Small Business Program through Goldman Sachs and they have a list of softwares to check out, but none seem particularly health care focused.

What is the best way to have a business phone number for small cash LLC? Looks like to use Google Voice you have to also have Google Workspace? I’d prefer not to have my personal number be used for business.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve found it to be a second SIM card into your phone, typically an eSIM. I can swap between lines as needed and set specific lines for specific numbers. (In my case an iPhone, but similarly with androids)

As a bonus, all of a sudden, your phone and related expenses becoming partial tax write off. ￼

> **Response 2:** I went as cheap as possible as my cash pay LLC is only my part time 5-12 clients a week, without plans to expand. 
I picked tracfone as a sim. For only call and text. So unfortunately texts are green but it gets the job done for only $135-150 a year. 
As long as you can transfer  number to another carrier if you need to expand it was the cheapest option I found. 

Tip: some of these pay as you go ones are only available as your primary line (I forgot the name eim1). So on my iPhone I had to put tracfone on eim 1 and then Tmobile on the second one. 
But that doesn’t make a difference since you can label them

I finally created my first (in a long time) strength program for a friend, only have a month written so far, but will be programming 16 weeks in prep for the mountain bike season come April. 

What do you recommend I charge for writing programs?  It took me a while to build the template on Google sheets, but now that I have one, it shouldn’t be too hard to modify for future clients.  I’ll also be putting programs together on an online app, which seems to be more tedious. 

Any recommendations?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have you tried final surge?  It's an app one of my old triathlon coaches used (I preferred it over training peaks). But, he used to do old school excel sheets and it drove me nuts.  At any rate, my last coach charged about 215 a month, but we talked constantly.

> **Response 2:** Depends on how much communication you have with them. Are you just writing a program and then giving it to them and that’s it? 

Are you communicating with them on a regular basis to answer questions or to update the program based on their feedback?

Google sheets was the most time consuming way for me to program for sure. Apps tend to make it easier for tracking, feedback, messaging, etc.

My dream is to start a mobile fitness studio. I currently practice as a pelvic health PT full-time and envision this mobile studio hosting pop-up group fitness classes at different locations in the community and potentially expanding to an online platform. I have taught group fitness classes in the past and have a couple group fitness certifications along with Sarah Duvall’s PCES. I am wondering about and seeking advice on legal things to get this rolling- LLC, liability insurance, waivers, etc. I appreciate any advice anyone has to offer!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Call the insurance company for sure- I’ve done retreats for example and needed a rider to add locations. Some insurance companies only cover the live class, not the recording or pre-recorded content. Ask a few companies lots of questions about what you would be covered for traveling and online. I highly recommend a lawyer to either create or review your waivers. But it is what you are covered for that will really come down to the wire if something happens. LLC you can set up or have your CPA take care of. If it is your dream, you’ll find the pieces and put it together:) Best of luck to you!

Have a patient with MS who is needing it for maintenance. She has Medicare part B. Can she continuously come throughout the year without taking breaks? I know maintenance is covered, but I still feel that coming to PT all year might cause some issues.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have had a few MS patients come continuing for several years. We just document that it is medically necessary for them to be able to maintain their independence in ADLs

> **Response 2:** I always question indefinite maintenance. Why can't you teach them a strong maintenance HEP and indications for returning to PT? In my opinion maintenance PT ought to be an intermittent service for 90% of cases. Wellness/private pay between episodes of maintenance if patient desires.

Hi everyone!
I have a question about starting a wellness/fitness service (that does NOT offer PT services) while holding a PT license.
What do I need to do to cover myself in terms of liability? Also, I'm in CA.... What's the deal with LLCs? Do I need to do something else to formally start a coaching business?

More details: after many years of thinking about it (and getting amazing inspiration from this group!) I've decided to take the leap and start a coaching service that focuses on fitness/wellness/mindfulness, is cash based, and not through the healthcare system (not treating injuries, illness, no MD referrals, or taking insurance)
In the meantime I'm still working in acute care (in the ICU and with transplants- completely different vibe 😅) and will continue for the foreseeable future.
 Over the past couple years I became a certified health coach, and have taken courses in nutrition, strength training, cardiovascular fitness and mindfulness (in addition to all the coursework I did in undergrad and grad school that applies to wellness). I feel like I'm qualified (maybe over qualified!) to provide coaching services but for some reason I'm terrified to start.

I just want to make sure I don't get in trouble with the PT board or into liability issues just because I hold a PT license... From this page, I see some of you provide wellness/non PT services that are separate from your PT practice. I need your wisdom! 🙏 

Thank you for reading this far and for your time! Again, this community has been a huge inspiration, I've been "lurking" for years but too afraid to jump into the conversation until now. Hello, finally!! 🙋🏽‍♀️☺️

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t know the laws in CA, but I could pretty much guarantee there are people with way less qualifications providing the service you’re describing. You’ll always be a PT, but as long as you aren’t performing PT I think you’re probably good to go. Of course, if I’m wrong, someone please correct me!

> **Response 2:** You must establish yourself as a legal business entity in your state.  Your Secretary of State determines this and the info is usually on their website or call them.  Then you need to be aware of local and county business laws.  Then ask your CPA which business entity is best for your business goals.

We need to take into account that great achievement involves great risk.

It pains me to see so many people with such incredible dreams — impactful, game-changing, earth-shattering dreams — then to see that there is an unwillingness to take ANY risk to go after that dream. 

It breaks my heart. Because those dreams…where did they come from? What if that is your true calling in life?

What pains me is people who are not willing to take the risk but then you ARE willing to spend everyday questioning whether or not you are actually living up to your full potential. That’s not living, that’s living in agony. 

Our callings don’t leave us. They will always stay at our proverbial “house”, and continue to knock at the door just waiting to be let in.

Some of us aren’t even willing to open the door. To take a risk in any way. But we all know deep down inside that the only way to make that dream happen is by taking a risk and believing in yourself. 

Open the door. 🚪

Does anybody provide a service where you can hold my hand through finishing my set up for my cash pay/wellness/Luna-based patient business? (PT in CALIFORNIA)

Currently I have my s corporation, business license, and ive taken some wellness patients so far and have also contracted with home health companies through my business. 

What I need help with is ensuring I have the right waivers, know how to send super bills, what to do after the 12th PT visit via direct access (cash pay), picking a simple EMR system, setting up electronic payments, and anything else I may be missing!

I have a friend who is going to develop/design my website for free  but at some point I would like to have scheduling embedded in there (they might be able to help with that).

Let me know what you would charge to help with this!

My goal is to work 4 days a week via W2 job and then see patients 2 days a week from my business. Plus i would perform tasks during the entire week related to virtual coaching/PT that isn't face to face and other business related tasks.

How much percentage raise did you get once you opened your own practice? Thanks in advance for sharing.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Very tough question to answer for several reasons. 

Initially my pay decreased because of the building phase. I now limit the number of visits I do per week for better work life balance so I can have tike to focus on my family, mentoring, teaching, other business endeavors, etc. For me money wasn't and isn't everything. 

Better to think about what you want to make and/or comfortable making and what it will take for you to get to that point. Consider things such as expenses and taxes that you'll have to pay when looking at what you will actually take home.

> **Response 2:** My phrase for a long time now: ‘my boss is super flexible, but the pay is terrible’ lol

I don’t want to sell the profession short and I’m a strong believer in charging appropriately so that our profession is respected. Also if someone charges super low it makes it harder for others to justify their higher prices. 

So regarding that…. What does everyone charge? Upstate New York area.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m not in NY- I’m in suburbs of GA. I charge 175 treatment and 225 eval. 

But around me I have seen as low as 100/visits and high as 300/visit.

> **Response 2:** Never realized there were so many of us in the Upstate area. I moved back just south of Rochester in ‘21 after a few years away. My own business model now is all remote consulting and coaching but I was charging $150.00 for an hour session treat or eval.

I have a patient I am seeing who has Parkinson’s Disease.  She also requires OT/ ST but I don't offer those services as I am solo/PT. 

A call from her primary MD office, they said she needs to get the other services as well but cannot work with 2 different companies so they have to be discharge from me for them to get all 3 services from a company like Fox Rehab. Not sure how true this is? 

Pt does not have Medicare insurance,  has a Medicare Advantage plan. Family/pt doesn't want to stop her PT with me. 

Any OT/ST in Piscataway NJ area?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not true at all. I'm also in NJ and only have PT, very often work alongside OT and ST from the larger companies, mostly Fox and Ignite.

> **Response 2:** Well that is false. I see a patient as a PT and she goes somewhere else for OT/ST. Have done this for decades.

I know this isn’t super “uncaged” of me but I just got credentialed with Medicare. A few days after that I received an email from a company called One Call indicating they are referring me a workers comp patient and to reach out to them for scheduling. 

I am assuming this is some sort of scam but wanted to ask if anyone has ever had this happen, and if there’s any way this may be legit. 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** No scam, im still full time in workers comp and see a lot of their referrals!

> **Response 2:** Thank you guys for all the info! I’ve never reached out to them before, so I assume they just found my business in a directory and chose it that way? lol

This is an official Medicare government test you must take to sell Medicare advantage plans   Read that and tell me if it makes any sense 👀 keep in mind. This is a 2026 test because open enrollment starts this week.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Wow! That is interesting. Haven’t heard a thing about HH services being limited at 100 days/year. But if I’m being honest, this wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest. It’s limited in SNF. OP coverage is limited by many insurances. Why not HH?

> **Response 2:** Its the basis of how medicare works and advantage plans follow the guildelines they just "manage" it a lot more. Medicare A/"advantage" A allows for up to 100 days of consecutive services (typically paid at days 1-20 100%, then often 80% after. If all consecutive services are used the patient has 60 days were they must remain out of the hospital to reset med A benefits. Although i did have one patient that exhausted his lifetime medicare A benefits which is wild. Med B benefits never really go out. Where these "advantage plans" screw you though is they really like to dictate how much therapy theyre willing to give under both a & b and it has to often be pre-authorized and sometimes they even dictate what codes we use vs medicare who lets us do our thing and give the best services we can. New flash: theres absolutely no advantage to an advantage plan.

UHC strikes again. Has anyone had a denial with this reason and been able to successfully dispute it?
It says it did not meet the timed service requirement outlined in Medicare ch 15 section 220. 
I have the units billed and time for each unit in the notes.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Section 221 requires reporting of “Total Timed Code Treatment Minutes” and “Total Treatment Minutes”. Is it possible these were not included/specified?

Of note, Time In and Time Out are not required per Medicare or UHC. It is currently being required by Anthem in certain states for PT (primarily NH) but being actively disputed.

> **Response 2:** Maybe time in/time out?

Mobile PT in FL!  
I noticed different chiropractic offices in my area “Now Offering Physical Therapy”  

Announcing that the PTA will be working alongside the chiropractors.  

I always thought a PTA needed to be supervised by a licensed PT??  Am I missing something?  And, how can they do this if PT supervision is required?
  
Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Suggest asking your state association to look into this.  Not sure about Florida, but in Michigan "physical therapy" is a protected term:  Chiropractors can perform/bill the same CPTs as PTs, but they can not advertise it as physical therapy services.

> **Response 2:** Chiros can bill PT CPT codes - ther ex, ther act, neuro, manual without a PT or  PTA present.   One in my area bills PT visit and has an LMT do massage.  We found that out when patient ran out of PT visits on insurance when we were the only place she went for PT, but chiro billing PT session for massage.

hello, i received a 1099 from UHC, however my patient has already prepaid me. One time they had told me to sign in digitally and get my check. Another time, they didn't answer or respond to any of my multiple calls, and still got a check, which I signed over to them because insurance was owed to them , (Not me). how do I
1. make it more crystal clear on the invoice that they do NOT pay me back, they owe the $ to the patient. it already says balance = $0, please pay patient
1. reverse this so that it doesn't show that they paid me

ps i hate UHC and am out of network, never went into their portal, never had been in networ. 

thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not today Satan 😈 not today 🔥🔥🔥🔥 burn it

> **Response 2:** Can you deposit the payment paid to you, manually post it as insurance payment and send the patient a refund check for the amount?

Question: I am a contract employee for a Pediatric Outpatient clinic. They are encouraging us to "bill an extra unit," for certain insurance companies after client's deductibles have been met. They are stating there is no additional cost to the consumer. They are advising us to use our clinical judgement as to whether or not the client would benefit from additional therapy. Our sessions are 45 minutes. Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm in Michigan where it's primarily Primary Health and BCBS. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** “Billing an extra unit” wiithout an appropriate amount of extra billable time spent with the patient is fraud. Period.

Using your clinical judgement to see if they need more therapy is always a good idea. But just billing an extra unit and justifying it because the patient doesn’t pay is… fraud.

> **Response 2:** In order to bill for the extra until you would need to treat the patient longer. If you treated for a longer duration then you should absolutely bill for that added unit. If not then you’re committing fraud

One of the things that may scare me out of trying to start my own business is the cost of health insurance. I will have to have health insurance for myself, my wife and hopefully for children in the near future. Is there anyone who has been there and done it? I’ve heard cost of purchasing insurance in the marketplace is insanely expensive which makes me question if it’s all worth it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We use CHM (Christian Healthshare Ministries) …similar to Medishare that was mentioned above. We’re a family of four and have no complaints so far.

> **Response 2:** We use Zion Health share plan and have a Health Matching Account for health related expenses. It costs me $500 less per month than my employer sponsored health insurance through Humana last year. And $300 of the total that I pay per month is going into my HMA which I can actually USE instead of paying all that extra money to then have to meet a deductible. We are a healthy family of 4 with no major health problems or concerns. It was a little hard this year because we just started this plan and didn’t have much saved in the HMA yet. But going forward I feel like the HMA will cover the small expenses and then Zion will cover anything over $1000 per need.

How does everyone keep track of their business receipts? I track my expenses for tax purposes, but am trying to figure out the best way to organize both email receipts as well as physical receipts just in case I’m audited in the future.
Thank you for any suggestions!

**Community Responses:**

my non-compete is fairly vague, stating that I can’t solicit business from current or former clients. 
if I leave my job to start my own practice and my clients ask why I’m leaving, if I simply state I’m starting my own thing is that considered soliciting business?
what about general marketing in my city towards clientele my current job serves?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Telling clients you are leaving because you’re starting your own business is not asking them to follow you. It’s a simple statement of fact.

> **Response 2:** Non-compete clauses are not enforceable and were ruled against in court.

Just curious! Does anyone sell peptides in their business? I have the opportunity from a supplier on selling them. Also, any legal issues from selling peptides? 
I am located in TN.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The only peptide I would want to sell is BPC-157 and that’s not FDA approved in injectable format

> **Response 2:** I don’t sell peptides but I offer my clients a free health assessment that can guide them to the correct supplements for their needs. I don’t stock supplements. I do carry a line of wellness products that I resell - Rowe Casa. I would say consider your referral sources. If a PT clients has a negative experience with the peptides and tells their referral source that they got their injectable peptides (assuming that’s what you’re referring too) from their PT provider, how would that affect a referral relationship especially if it’s a medically licensed referral partner? The peptide game is crazy right now! Also check your state practice act…

Rental space dilemma: 

After one person commented that being in the CrossFit gym could quickly stifle my growth I decided to see what else was out there. So I stumbled onto a 1000 sq ft commercial office space with pretty easy access to the freeway. This space would offer me two 11.5 ft x 7.5 f (90 sq ft) treatment rooms, access to a shared kitchenette room, and a main room with private entrance to it that is 20 ft x 40 ft (800 square ft). The price for this listing would be $1000 which includes all utilities, WiFi which they said they would have a WiFi hub added to my end of the building, and no CAM fees. The place is also only 15-20 minutes from the house plus a good fairly central location in Utah County. Oh it would also be a 1 min drive to another one of RxFit’s CrossFit gym which is the gym I’m a member of. 

I would be sharing the building with a Real estate company whom is the owner of the building. He seemed really interested in getting me into the space and talked about having a couple other offers, most likely a sales tactic, but said he didn’t want them and thought I would be a good fit for the place. Once again probably a sales tactic, but he definitely seemed interested like they would modify whatever I needed to help make the space more suitable. 

So weighing in this space against the CrossFit gym space I feel like I would be an absolute idiot to not seriously consider it as an option. 

Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Prior to becoming a PT, an old Crossfit gym of mine had a PT and massage therapist rent a space inside. All I could ever think of was how it would be difficult to communicate with clients (or to relax when getting a massage) with music always cranked up and blasting really loud during your business hours and having no control over that.

> **Response 2:** What is your 3 or 5 year plan? We can fill 2,000 sq ft really easily with 2 clinicians. I have owned and relocated over 10-clinics and my first was 800 sq ft, but 2K sq ft is about the best size for us.

What advice would you give to a therapist who wants to be uncaged?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Answer three questions: WHY and WHY and WHAT.... Why do you want to be UNCAGED for yourself? What is in it for you and your family (or future family).  WHY does YOUR practice have to exist in the community?  WHAT is it that you do for people. Then..... BELIEVE in yourself. Understand what your PASSION is. Display ACTIVE PATIENCE.  Maintain your GRIT.  Finally, truly, save yourself time, money (in the long run), and a world of frustration by having a guide/mentor/coach who has done it to lead you.

> **Response 2:** Hire a business coach.  They help rocket your business forward faster and with less guesswork.  They have several proven processes because they've been there and have already helped others.
You're going to make your own mistakes no matter what, but you can avoid the ones they've already made. They know how to coach past them. 
David Bayliff , who runs this page has an incredible program. Free knowledge is great, but it only takes you so far.
You need to invest in your knowledge by hiring a coach. 
I am in my 3rd practice. A formal coaching group was the best investment I ever made.

Luna PT question as I know there’s a lot of you who do Luna part time and I’m waiting on approval of my post on the LinkedIn group:

Hi! PT near Boston here. I live on the edge of the city so all of my patients so far have been in the suburbs with easy parking. I just got assigned a patient where it appears there’s no parking within at least half a mile. I am trying to figure out the logistics of this. I could also easily take the train and walk a half mile or so but that’s not feasible with the table. Would love to connect with other PTs practicing in urban areas to understand what you do in these situations. Do you:

1. Park the half mile (or however far) away and do the walk with your table 
2. Set the expectation with the patient that due to their unique circumstances (keeping it vague to protect privacy), you cannot bring the table
3. Factor in walking time from the car with the table and let the Luna team know if this total commute time is out of range 
4. Other 

I already tried to contact the Luna team to get more info on parking so please don’t suggest this! I plan to call the patient to discuss further but curious as to what I should say if my research and knowledge of the area is correct that there isn’t parking within at least half a mile.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely factor in your time and I wouldn’t bring the table. I actually hardly bring my table around at all because I find that the patients do better if I just show them how to do exercises at home using what they have.

> **Response 2:** Thanks for the suggestions, all! I spoke with the patient and they are totally fine not having the table.

Been seeing a lot of folks talking about Prompt lately. Anyone know if it’s actually worth switching to? And how’s the pricing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I personally hated it and ALL of my coworkers did too. I am not sure if it was the implementation from my old company but it felt choppy, had too many screens and made it difficult for me to follow my thoughts on the patient. When i covered other clinics I couldn't even tell what was actually going on with the patient. Again, the implementation could have been poor in my old job but we had PTs quit over it.

> **Response 2:** Prompt is good but when you start their add ons. It is expensive check out SelfDocAIMR much cheaper and a does more.

Just some PSAs for y'all.

- Stay active in your local groups. Especially ones where people are frequently connecting with each other ("who do you use for hair/nails/doctor/dentist/PT/gym/personal training").

- Connect with people who are doing things like what you do. They will advocate for you! AND now you know people to refer out to when you're not the right fit.

- Plan WAYYYYY in advance for who to hire and how to hire. I just got 6 new evals because of one connection, and it's going to swamp my schedule. And I am not prepared to hire -- learn from my mistake. 🫠

Keep on truckin', y'all.

Second post, sorry y’all! 
Do you offer any paternity leave? We haven’t had to deal with any maternity and paternity yet, but as our clinicians are starting to grow their families this question has come up a few times. I know ultimately it’s our decision on what we do, but just seeing what other companies are doing/offering. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve never (17 yrs as a PT) worked for a company that offered paid parental leave, just STD + PTO or unpaid leave. I’ve always resented that. My husband isn’t in healthcare and gets 3wk 100% paid leave.. his company breaks it down that both parents get 3wk for “family bonding” and this can be used for any situation - adoption, birth, etc. The birthing person gets an additional 9wk paid leave for “physical recovery”, so 12 wk total for them. 

Paid leave is the right thing to do for both parents, and (sadly) offering this would set you apart from the rest of the healthcare field. I know you’re probably a small company, and it really should be the big orgs that are doing this, but if you can, please offer it!

> **Response 2:** I think it’s hard for any employer to do this, but my personal opinion is that at least partially covering paid parental leave is the right thing to do and you’ll have a more loyal staff because of it. Family first.

Anyone have recommendations for the best courses / CEUs if you are interested in treating runners, specifically running form analysis w/ digital equipment etc.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Chris Johnson

> **Response 2:** Go follow Christopher Johnson and learn everything you can from him. He does a great job simplifying the running athlete and empowers you to help guide the athlete along the rehab journey. Nathan Carlson does a wonderful job teaching you everything about BSIs which is the first pathology you should be clearing with most running athletes. Outside of that, there are plenty of good courses such as RunDNA, ICE Rehabilitation of the running athlete, and Jay Dicharry's book anatomy of a runner.

Anyone in here do post-op plastic surgery lymphatic massage? I am falling into that niche (which is cool) and just wanted to see what others are doing in terms of making it OT/PT, since I'm an OT and a CLT, but these patients don't have a lymphedema diagnosis. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't do it but I had a massage therapist I treated telling me she does it. She charges then extra bc it is a "specialty" and they will pay for it. She also says that she sells them in packages only bc the clients drop out as soon as they start feeling/looking better and don't finish the protocol and then have issues.

> **Response 2:** Curious is this for all plastic surgery? Facial, butt lifts, tummy tucks or mainly a certain type of surgery?

Any great tips on converting clients from events to full session paying customers. We have a gym event coming up next Saturday that’s booked full, clients are getting 20 minute spot treatments (stretch and manual). 
I have names and emails for follow up, but would love to hear ideas on what has worked best to convert those clients to full service. Like offer booking right then and there? Follow up with a coupon, a survey about their experience, offer the next workshop etc. 
Can’t wait to hear what has worked for others!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What I’ve done… when they finish… let them know that they will most likely need follow up to make sure their issue doesn’t continue to bother them and tell them you’ll be following up in 24-48 hours to check in and give next steps. Then on follow up, book for next session 🙂

Hi all—looking for some opinions and also suggestions on where else I might post this.

I have a patient who’s a professional dancer and stilt walker. She’s quite hypermobile and recently ruptured her ACL, along with sustaining some medial meniscus injury.

She’s received two surgical opinions: one recommends a cadaver graft, while the other recommends using her hamstring. She personally prefers the surgeon who suggested the hamstring graft. He mentioned that although he often uses patellar tendon grafts for his football players, he feels that a hamstring graft may be more appropriate given her background in dance.

Would love to hear your thoughts or clinical experience on graft selection for hypermobile, high-level performers.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Not a dancer, but an athlete (marathon runner and equestrian primarily) and I have 2 grafts from separate surgeries/surgeons. Both were done as cadaver grafts as the surgeons, who were both board certified sports med docs, stated they won’t do autografts on athletes with known hyper mobility due to the high failure rate. I had chronic dislocations prior to surgery and have had a few instances where I definitely would have dislocated had the graft not “caught.” Super painful still, but everything stayed where it belongs lol. Hope that helps.

Hello! I am an occupational therapist who lives in Southwest Florida. I am looking at starting my own private, swimming lessons company. I would like to have it out of my home pool. I would like to advertise that I am an occupational therapist and am starting the Angelfish swim school which is created for therapists. ￼ apparently, I also have to have an additional certification through the state of Florida by approved providers.  My question is it has anyone done a business like this? Am I putting my OT license at risk in any w￼ay by saying I am an occupational therapist? I will have insurance and a liability waiver created. (Tips on this would be appreciated also). It will be cash pay. I am looking to serve children of all abilities, but also want to emphasize ￼ my occupational therapy background ￼ because my approach will be sensory based.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in a moms group in Gainesville and people are constantly looking for swimming lessons for their kiddos. I’m sure this venture will be a success!

> **Response 2:** Having a waiver saying the client know they are not receiving OT services is good but if anything happens, you are always held to your highest license so just make sure whatever you are doing is still within your practice act

Thanks for the add to the group. Very enlightening thus far as I read through the older posts.

Does anyone run a mobile practice in an area that is heavy with Medicare beneficiaries? That is the make up of my region so going full cash mobile practice is a bit of a concern for me having to immediately know I can’t treat this high % of the population around me. I feel like I would need to accept MC to make it work.

Any advice is much appreciated.

**Original Post:**
So I’m new here. Mostly just read what everyone has to say. But I’m trying to become Uncaged and I was wondering if anyone here has experience with having a clinic space in your home or in a shed type building in the back yard. I don’t really have the space in my home but I’ve thought about the possibility of having a shed type building finished out in my back yard for a clinic space. It is just me and I think ultimately it would be a lot cheaper than commercial rent. I’m planning to start mobile whenever I find my first clients until I gain some momentum and then transition to a brick and mortar clinic. Any considerations with having a clinic out of your home/personal property? Anyone who has done this or thought about it and decided against it and why? Anyone who has done it and loved it? Legally what kind of hoops are there to jump through as well as does it change anything with insurance (homeowners vs business)? Basically I’m just trying to decide if this is a viable option or if I should bite the bullet and rent a space. I welcome any and all feedback at this point.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m about to open my business from my home in about a month. I was a little nervous about clients knowing where I live but at this point I don’t really have the option to rent out space. Eventually, if I generate enough business, I’d love to rent out space……I’m researching the whole insurance thing right now…I’ll let you know how it goes. 😬

> **Response 2:** I know there are laws about dimensions   In Illinois only 10x10 is allowed to not be taxed. Then what to do about a bathroom etc. would be tough to insure

Hi! A few questions!!

1) I am in Texas! Someone in texas doing mobile PT? Is it preferred to go LLC or sole prop route?? I am new at this so I don’t know much of the difference? Did u go the lawyer route? Or online routine to register business?

2) once i do that, do i need to register my business somewhere else??? Like the state?? Or the LLC/sole prop covers that? 

2) For business checking accounts, For the Business tax identification number, do I get that whenever I make my business LLC Or sole prop? Or where do I get that number?

3) another one for business checking accounts…where do I obtain the “Articles of Organization” or “Certification of Formation” of my business?

4) any banks you recommend for business account?

Thank u!!!!!!!!!!!

Anybody deal with patients with using HSA card to pay for services being charged as cash pay patients. Then the patient submitted the super bill to insurance , UHC manages this self payor ( NBA league). Now my patient wants notes and I gave them everything and now UHC denied like 8 visits for not having specific exercises listed in the daily notes (basically crap reason). In order to reconsider UHC want all these extra notes but not sure if I want to comply. My question is Can the HSA debit card charge back the money. And secondly hopefully the patient doesn't have to pay it. I loathe UHC! Getting out of network with them, ASAP.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is the exact reason why you are cash pay for UHC. The patient agreed to be responsible and head to face what insurance plan they bought. If they want additional daily notes you can't keep those from patients but if they want appeals and other things you do not need to comply

> **Response 2:** So the client is trying to get reimbursed by their HSA and UHC? I’m confused.

When applying for a new job, can the new employer see or have access to previous salary. I’m leaving my current employer to go to a clinic where in my interview they mentioned I would qualify for up to $15 per hour more. ￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** They can call your old employer and ask for salary, but they may not do that, and your old employer may not give them the information even if they ask.  That would be the only way for them to get that info.  There are a lot of "what if's" in that scenario.

But my question is-- why do you care if they know?  It's irrelavent what you made before.  If the new employer is offering to pay more, and/or your old employer was underpaying you, that's obviously why you want to leave (and a very good reason to leave at that).  The only numbers that are important here are the standard/average pay for a therapist with your education and experience in your area, and the cost of living in your area.  Demand what you're worth, and don't let them dictate that to you!

> **Response 2:** tell them you were making $150/hr

Hi all! Do superbills need to be broken down by cost per CPT code or is the total charge of all CPT codes sufficient? Example (for simple math) 
Option 1:
2 units 97110 = $50
2 units 97112 = $50 
total = $100

Option 2 (can it just be listed?) 
2 units 97110
2 units 97112
total = $100

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Your CPT codes do not need to equal the cost off the visit. You can charge $70 per CPT code and cahrge a flat fee of $150. Insurance will reimbure the patient based on $150 but the data will be input for CPT codes in your area at $70 per unit

> **Response 2:** I've heard of people charging a certain rate per unit that will equal higher than the cash pay rate, then adding another line item to bring the rate down to the cash pay rate. IE if your cash pay rate was $250...
 1 unit Therex $100
1 unit manual $100
1 unit therapy $100
Provider Discount -$50.

I have a new OON practice. Right now about 3k in claim reimbursement / month. Billing service is quoting $450/month or 7% (for the first 6 months). States they are a boutique billing company and can also help with some light insurance verifications. Is this a good rate?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'd recommend, as an owner of a billing company, to look for a contract with a 30 day walk away policy. For example, my clients sign a contract, but can give me 30 days notice at any time. And 7% isn't high for your volume. It goes down the higher your volume gets. I specialize in small/growing businesses. This is because I love guiding the new provider. I do recommend doing it on your own for a bit, but if your time is better spent marketing, etc, get a biller. 😉

> **Response 2:** If you have time, then I woyld recommend learning how to do it yourself.  If you get busier and need to delgate, then you will understand what you are hiring and overseeing.

Chase Ink Business Credit Card offers $750 cash back after spending $7,500 on purchases in the first 3 months. Guess it's a good problem to have that this is tough to do, but does any have any suggestions on large business-related purchases I can put on the card to hit this mark? So far I can think of paying for my EMR upfront for a year, business insurance..would paying off my car payment/paying a year of my auto insurance upfront count as a business expense? Gas?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We placed a large order of shirts to have on hand as we have customers and gym members wanting to buy shirts.  Great advertising for the clinic and a good way to get the extra points if that’s what you are after.

> **Response 2:** You can use a business card to pay for anything, it doesn’t have to be business related. US Bank business leverage has a similar cash back bonus but is $7500 spend in 4 months if that extra month would help.

Hi everyone
I’m checking UHC insurance benefits and I always get confused when it says no referral required and no visit limits. Does it mean I can see patient without a doctor’s referral , no signed POC and however long the patient needs? Insurance also says do not charge $35 co-pay. She’s a neuro patient . Please advise, I am not trying to beat the system, I just need guidance because I’m new to this. Thank you

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Typically then you'd follow your state practice act. Always follow the strictest rule

> **Response 2:** Q: Checking insurance benefits and I always get confused when it says no referral required, and no visit limits. 
Can I see the patient without a doctor’s referral, no signed POC and however long the patient needs? 

No referral means it's not an HMO plan that would need a referral. 
Check your state direct access laws, we have 20 days or 10 visits whichever is sooner without a script, and a script from a doctor is needed to have the insurance pick it up. And also charts need a doctor's signed POC/eval and re-evals.
You have to be able to show progress, and it be a skilled therapy needed and not maintenance care. Otherwise if there's a plateau (after one re-eval already having a flare up) they may try their HEP on their own a bit, because insurance may reject payment and the bill may fall to the patient.
Also unlimited visits may also have a money cap if it's Medicare, which is about 30 visits before the chart would be audited and modifiers need to be added each time. 
Was told some neuro can be tough because can be auto immune dx e.g. M.S. where it does not always steadily improve. But working in Ortho, I don't have all the insurance and outs.

Seeking a sports med PT in Charlotte, NC area to consult with a very active college student/military recruit with hip pain/prior femoral stress reaction who is home for Christmas break. He was already screened by ortho MD on campus and advised to stretch hip flexors and rest over break but he's seeking a more specific management plan for MSK pain. 

His mom is a friend from high school and she reached out to me for advice but I'm 5 hours away and am trying to find someone local to them to refer to for in person screening. Thanks.

EDIT: He admitted it was a miscommunication on his part. I told him I understand. He can keep them since like someone what mentioned, they would follow him anyways since I have no availability. Plus he's built a great relationship with them and I want them to continue to be successful. 

I appreciate everyone's quick input.

Advice please! I have an independent contractor who I've known since he was an intern at a clinic we both worked at. When he decided he wanted to leave there, I brought him on to my business. He then wanted to start his own (I fully supported it).
We had a conversation the other week that he was getting really fully with his business and wouldn't be able to see my clients anymore. No problem. But I did say, you have to see SO and SO bc I can't fit them into my schedule. He just gave me his last time sheet and said thank you so much for blah blah. I asked oh you're not seeing SO anymore. He said, oh I am but through my (his) business since you said you have no room for them. 
Ummm... that's not what I meant. 
What do I do, if anything? It is 2 clients (brothers).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What? Wow? That is awful

> **Response 2:** I would shake it off and let it go. Maintain a good relationship with him. There may be a day he is too busy to take patients and will refer to you, but not if this gets blown up. 
Most likely these patients will follow him anyway if he was the one treating them.

Have you ever ended a relationship with a referral source because they were difficult? I have one that is rude, texts at all hours of the night, any day of the week, and tries to micromanage me. They do not refer very often so the stress doesn't really seem worth it to me.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had a friend of a friend who was a PA who thought they could tell me how to run my business, esp when it came to their friends who needed PT. So yes, we cut ties.

Those who are solo therapists, how do you handle vacations? Are your patients ok taking a week off when you are on vacation? Have you felt people quit or got unmotivated when you paused services?
I am from Brazil, and between  going home and a specialization I am taking, I take about 4 weeks off a year. 
I am technically ready to uncage. I have full 17 sessions a week and a 3 week waiting list, and I currently stopped taking new patients for the rest of the year because I can’t even fit the people I have… but I am held back by fear…. Mostly silly I am the one supporting a family of 6….
What if I go on vacation and my caseload quit on me? (Hasn’t happened and I’ve taken tons of time this year… but I did not really care or apologize because it was not my main income… people were still here when I come back… but I worry that when I need them to stay they may go?)
What if something happens and as a LLC I don’t have disability insurance?
What if once I go full time all the patients disappear?
What if another covid like event happens and I have no patients??? 

It is so scary… right now I plan on holding until end of April because I go to Brazil for spring break, and have 1 1-week class in February…. So I figured i could use my work PTO and sabe some money for emergencies in between…. But I AM technically ready… so sometimes I feel like I should just do it because there will always be a reason to wait a bit more…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Network with a few PTs around that you can refer to when you’re out.  
Most of my clients prefer to wait for me, but appreciate the options — especially for acute flare ups.

> **Response 2:** One of the biggest things I've noticed since becoming uncaged is my patients are so supportive of me taking time off and doing things for myself.... No guilt trips or rude comments like I'd always get from coworkers and patients in the corporate setting. I have just tried to do more trips starting midweek so that I can squeeze patients in before and after I go, and flights are usually cheaper that way too!

Tactics come and go which is why Uncaged tries so hard to be focused predominantly on principles. 

Yes we teach tactics as well but we want to help instill in our clients the skills to adapt with an ever changing market.

Hi Everyone! Just wanted to see if anyone was familiar with good sites/platforms to build and support online courses/programs. Building out some online content/courses that would include videos and pdfs. I've heard of Podia and Kajabi and Squarespace courses (my website platform). User friendly is ideal (this stuff is not my forte), affordable, and bonus if there is a supporting phone app. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use Squarespace for mine and it’s worked out really well and was much more cost-effective than the other platforms

Do you all use Venmo ? I was told the biz acct is not hippa compliant however I offer classes to organizations and centers in my area 
Would this be an instance where I could use Venmo ? As I’m not exchanging sensitive info 
For private therapy and Eval’s obviously a no due to hippa 
Any info would be appreciated thanks 
Also what other forms of payments do the private pay clinicians take with low fees ?

**Community Responses:**

I use business venmo and Business paypal for my private people it goes through my EMR. You sign a business agreement

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been using Hellonote for over five years. I would definitely not do the paper method for multiple reasons. Or Google forms. There’s lots of different pricing options pending on your business set up and what you want to do. I know the lack of clear pricing is a frustration for many, but it does depend on your set up and they will help you figure out what’s best for your practice. There’s also various discounts that you can get as well.￼ they also have different tiers depending on what type of business you have, and what kind of assistance he would like to have.

**Community Responses:**

Physiapp is clunky and search on the iPhone seems to output different results than on the computer. 

MedBridge app doesn’t allow building programs. Have to use web app. 

Switchback works but it’s all your own videos that you load.  There is not a default library. 

I use prehab guys exercise library right now. Hoping they create an app at some point for it but the exercises are on par with what I do. 

Haven’t tried the others mentioned here yet

Can I create an LLC and sign a contract with a Home Health agency with said LLC? 

I want to start a Mobile PT side hustle and eventually quit my 9-5 BUT I an opportunity to do PRN HH has opened up and I figured I’d be good experience outside of my typical director position. Would love to create an LLC and show some income coming in ASAP just not sure how this works! 

Thanks guys!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Some home health companies will hire your LLC as a staffing company. So if you have PTAs who you can hire under your LLC as 1099s you can offer the agency PT staffing from eval to DC by your staffing company.  Then you can make a little bit off each visit done by your PTAs. In Florida all you need is to get a Health Care Services Pool license. $600 every two years.

Hi! Looking for a neuro based PT for a patient of mine who is going to Naples/South Naples Florida for the entire month of November. He is post stroke impacting L side, approximately 5ish months out. Relatively high level in regards to balance and activity tolerance however still has a heavily involved L side. He wants to pay out of pocket or go cash based. 
He has the ability to volley in pickleball and go for a mile walk with SPC.
Let me know if there are any leads!

**Original Post:**
In an outpatient clinic setting, as a PT, have you ever seen an exercise physiologist perform an ultrasound on a patient? Or stretch a patient’s shoulder? I’m a little confused because I didn’t think they could perform either US or manual on a patient. Thanks for any insight!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Private practices often blur the line so much to deliver treatment , that it’s difficult to know what’s legal and not legal.  Are modalities under OT, PT, OTA, PTA and ATC only ? Does that vary by state ? Also is stretching under a tech or professional degree? When is it flexibility ex and when is it “Manual Therapy “?

> **Response 2:** Our techs (high schoolers/college kids) did ultrasound on patients and one clinic I worked at had those same kids stretching hips when PTs were triple booked. And on the same note, who is stretching people at these stretch clinics that are opening everywhere? Certainly not therapists.

HIPPA compliance question. I have the opportunity to rent a space in a Pilates studio. However, it’s an open gym space and there is a camera within the space. I have concerns regarding HIPPA compliance and having a recording device in the treatment space. Can anyone provide me with resources to figure this out. Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you contracted with insurance? If not, HIPAA probably doesn’t apply to you. Most cash providers do not fall under HIPAA regulations. Patient privacy should always be considered, but if the camera is just video and not audio, maybe some sort of partition around your treatment table is enough.

> **Response 2:** Interesting conversation about HIPAA.  I always thought we all need to remain compliant regardless if we contract with insurance or not.

Are Bachelor’s Degree PT’s being phased out regarding larger company hospital supervisory roles? The goal is to have our business anyway but this is what I am noticing.
Clarifying: in hospital settings with job openings  In SNF, yes Bachelors will still continue.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Because I see you mentioned this question is in regards to job postings, the answer is no. Experience is important. Candidates are usually encouraged to apply regardless of the degree. If they have a license in goos standing and the experience for the role, then the individual is a good candidate. 

For teaching related roles, without other certifications and/or degrees, then it may be more challenging to obtain.

Anyone have treated pts with POTS  I have limited experience but want to help this patient and her MD both suffer from this. Or if you can point me to go links or educational places to learn to effectively treat this better.  Thanks very much

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A PT with POTs here, I've used the Modified CHOP protocol with success for myself, but I wasn't already super deconditioned. 

For my patients, the protocol is often too much too soon for them, but your goals are to stay below manageable levels of symptoms and ideally build strength/cardio in semireclined or reclined positions before standing. 

Also fyi: exercise often can decrease the amount of heart rate increase with activity, and increases a person's capacity, but many will still have symptoms right when they stand, or if they have to stand still (store checkout lines still luck for me)

> **Response 2:** I have treated a patient with EDS & POTS it was a very slow transition over the course of weeks and tolerance varied each visit. We started mostly in hooklying-> slightly elevated-> perched at edge of table progressing to standing next to table with frequent rests, checking BP and she increased tolerance to recumbent bike.
The EDS website has lots of great information on POTS as well.

Does anyone have any experience hiring someone on a work visa? I have an offer I'd like to extend to a therapist, but need to be able to take over her green card/labor certification process. I'm assuming I'd need a lawyer for support, but looking for some direction if anyone has any experience?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Musillo Unkenholt..based in Ohio..My previous employer used them. You need to show proof of ability to pay as a company for green card process.

> **Response 2:** Being one of irk visa for more than 10 years before becoming a permanent resident , I can tell you that it’s worth sponsoring for the visa as far as employee retention. Generally they don’t hop jobs easily. Yeah it comes with a price tag but in the long run you won’t repent it. 
I used the law firm mentioned here from ohio as well. And I like them very much

# *Investment vs. Expense*
## ***6 questions to ask yourself!***

*Starting and growing a business can often feel like a financial strain.*

*How we approach the way in which we look at the purpose of the money being spent from a mindset point can change everything for us.*

*It is pretty well understood what expenses are.*

*In short, an expense is something that costs you money without the opportunity for further growth or time freedom.*

*Investments are when the money spent towards a thing, a service, or even an employee is going to reward us and/or the practice on the backend.*

*In essence, it gives us our time back and/or makes us/the business money.*

*When money is on the table, or being considered, a great question to start with is: Will this (thing putting the money towards) impact our business in a significant way to where we can afford NOT to do it?*

*So often, the first question is can we afford it?  That question can be detrimental because this is attacking it just like you would an expense.*

*There are 5 more questions to ask that will help you to decide if the money potentially being spent is an investment or an expense.*

*Will this give us the ability to serve our customers better? Yes or No?*

*Will it improve my/our ability and knowledge of growing and running the business?*

*Will it help free up more time for me/my employees?*

*Will it make a difference in how satisfied our customers are?*

*Will it help to differentiate me/my practice in the market, and make me/the practice more different than I/it already am/is?*

*Answering “Yes” to any of these questions is a good indicator that the money is going to help make the business better for (us) and for (our) customers.*

*When we immediately write off things (say “No”) because it doesn’t fit in the budget, then we are approaching them with an expense mindset.*

*Send me a DM if you are ready to invest in yourself!*

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Tried the monthly subscription but didn't find much success with it. We found better success with including it as a "bonus" in our core offer as it really helps show the value of the offer. Took that idea from Alex Hormozi's 100M Offer book and it has been a game-changer.

Hi everyone,
I’m currently in early discussions with an assisted living facility that’s offering to rent me a space for $570/month. They also mentioned potentially taking a percentage of concierge service revenue.

At this point, there’s no formal contract on either side. Before I commit, I’d love to hear from those who’ve done something similar:
 • What are fair or negotiable terms in these types of agreements?
 • Any red flags I should watch out for?
 • Would you suggest a flat rent only, percentage only, or a hybrid?
 • How do you structure services (Medicare Part B, private pay, wellness/stretch programs, etc.) in this kind of setting?
 • Any tips for ensuring the agreement is sustainable and protects my business interests?

Your input would be hugely appreciated. Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wouldn’t get involved with anyone who wants to be in your books and taking a percentage. The flat rate is very reasonable, if you have your own space.

> **Response 2:** Flat rate and a percentage?  No way.  Per person charge or hourly rate most preferred.  When business picks up, a monthly rate may be best.  Keep them out of your books...

Current CPA I used for 2023 - I am paying 1500$ for business tax prep and then 450$ for personal tax prep… then I also pay 599$ a quarter for “small business accounting” which includes quickbooks subscription and… bookkeeping? I don’t even know lol. She set up Gusto for me to use where I pay myself through, I’ve I fill out an accountable reimbursement worksheet every quarter and then everything else is run through quickbooks. I also have found every single call I’ve had with her I do NOT understand the answer to the questions I’ve asked such as what I should be paying myself. What Ive paid myself so far has been guesses. So questions: 

1. Is anyone else paying these kind of fees for tax prep and how much are you paying quarterly and for what exactly? 
2. If she cant answer my question of what i should pay myself, how do i know? I know it’s a “reasonable salary” but obviously this will change based on business revenue.. 

Any insight would be appreciated

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have a mobile PT business but my husband and I own a hardware store, s corp.  The fees for accounting are what we pay our accountant but gross revenue dictates this. Quickbooks rates have substantially increased in last 15 years. I used to buy it for $299 and it was a working edition for 3 years. Now, it is 1 year subscription (with payroll) and $1400. 
Reasonable salary is what you could hire someone to do your job. Go on glassdoor and check out local salaries for your area. Your salary does not have to change based on revenue unless you are putting in more hours.

If anyone who knows in the Philadelphia area of
Southeastern PA and Delaware area hiring PRN or part time PT. Please let me know it is for myself and not easy to find work with my years of experience and not having the DPT. 
Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you seriously being overlooked for not having a DPT?

> **Response 2:** Patrick Walker, I wonder if it has to do with you carrying a larger price tag with your experience. If they are insurance based, their reimbursement rates are the same but newer grads are much cheaper relative to the rates. Outcomes aren't valued as much with insurance. If you can treat someone in 6 sessions but a new grad needs 12, more revenue that way too.

⚖️ of 1️⃣-🔟  How comfortable are you with FAILURE? 

🙋🏻‍♀️ Can you name the last time you failed? 

🌶️ Spicy take: If it wasn’t within the last 30 days, you aren’t taking enough risks. 

🌶️🌶️ Extra Spicy take: Failure is essential to your growth as a business owner. 

🚀 In Launchpad, we teach you how to fail well and come out stronger 💪🏼 Don’t let fear of failure keep you from starting your business!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Failure has always been a learning opportunity for me. Failure tells us where the "knowledge gaps" are located and gives us a chance to fill them in to create something better! Failure is inevitable but it is our response to overcome it that makes us stronger, more resilient and unstoppable. There must be a trial, friction or hardship to develop perseverance. So my encouragement would be to focus on the lesson learned, apply it and always figure out a way to move forward with your new perspective or "knowledge". Great post Hannah DeGroot !

Is it worth it to purchase the domain you want in .com (for $2500) if .org is currently available?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Buy them all. If you’ve done a good job with a business name, owning all digital real estate is important.

> **Response 2:** Agree with others. If you can tweak it a little to get the .com I’d go that route but if not choosing another works too. The typical understanding of .org for organizations and things like that is shifting since we are running out of urls. But also depends a little on your clientele in my opinion. If you are targeting an older population, stick with .com for sure. Younger population more understanding of difference url endings.

I'm in the process of applying to Medicare, and the application is saying that the bank where I have my business account (a local credit union) does not have a Medicare ID.  Specifically, the application says this:
"EFT dataset Space Coast Credit Union is not associated to any Medicare IDs. Please associate a Medicare ID to this EFT dataset in the Electronic Funds Transfer topic."
Do I need to open another account at a different bank just to accept payment from Medicare?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This happened to me as well with Suncoast Credit Union.  I called the First Coast Service Options and they said it was ok just to have the voided check.  I would call them to verify

> **Response 2:** This is a warning only. Just go ahead and submit. You are good. This is standard as your business does not have a current Medicare ID. I do credentialing all the time for people and this is the standard procedure.

I own a cash based PT clinic in Colorado. I have a patient who recently tried submitting a super bill that I provided to this patient, to their insurance co which is United Healthcare. UHC did not deny the claim but put it on a temporary hold requesting more info from me the provider. The info that they are requesting are things such as provider first and last name, NPI number, tax ID number etc. A list of items that are already clearly stated on the super bill that was submitted. They are also requesting patient’s medical records. Is this normal? Has anyone else dealt with something similar?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I just went through the same exact thing with them. I've been working on it for a couple of months & my pt just let me know they got paid at least a couple of weeks ago 🤦‍♀️ even though I've gotten more paperwork from them. Now to just catch up with the remaining ones I hadn't even submitted yet. 🙄

> **Response 2:** I’ve billed UHC two times (same patient). They paid the first one and then put a hold on the second one for lack of info. They said I needed to submit my W9, which I had done months ago. I think this is just what UHC does and one of the reasons why everyone hates them.

Dear hivemind, inspiration needed. Thinking of future possibilities, how likely am I to succeed with a cash-based PT & Wellness practice in upstate NY?

Reasons for doubt: abundance of insurance-based PT clinics.

We - fam - are thinking of moving to upstate NY. Currently I work in OP PT, insurance based. 

But I can’t bear thinking of owning/running my PT business with insurance.

Please help with info/inspiration, ideas for R&R

TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m out in the Rochester NY area, so a different market, but my family is in New Paltz and the surrounding area. New Paltz is bursting with people who have moved from NYC who probably have cash to spend for the convenience and quality you would be offering. That might be more difficult in Catskill. Just a little too far from NYC

> **Response 2:** Where in upstate NY are you thinking (out of curiosity more than anything)? I am near Saratoga, have been solely cash-based since I started up 3+ years ago. It’s been slow to build up, but I also have not invested a ton of time or money directly into building because of how my life is and how I want it to be (meaning, I have a lot of other endeavors, and don’t want to be treating multiple patients/day, every day, and also don’t need this to rely on for income). I think it can be whatever you want it to be, as long as you know what energy it’s going to take to get to that point.

**Community Responses:**

I believe you can claim either mileage OR expenses on the vehicle, not both.

Since I use mine for business and personal as well, I keep track of mileage separately for business and personal and I don’t track expenses.

The owner offered to add my name and services on their website at no charge. Any pros and cons? 🤩💰🤝
I can only think of that people may perceive me as an employee not a independent clinician. 🧑‍💼🤔🤷

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Will you be only posting on their social media or can you mark it as a collaboration? 

My only issue is if you only post on their social media, you are not growing your brand if you move locations. It would be better to collaborate so you both will gain followers and access their followers and if you ever leave, the followers that like your content will still be with you. Hopefully that makes sense

> **Response 2:** I’m not sure what the cons if any are? Somebody willing to put your name, face, and company on their website, for free, in front of their clientele, who they have already established the know-like-trust factor, further vouching for you as a reputable service provider? Seems like a win to me.

Hey there,
If allowed, I’d like to understand more about OTs in private practice. 

I am a PT in private practice and over the past year I’ve been able to get a pretty steady case load of clients.  (Mostly all Medicare) I’d like to bring on an OT so that my clinic would better serve the population that I personally like to treat (more neuro/less orthopedic). 

I have thought about two options of 
1) hiring an OT (not sure I can afford) 
2) inviting an OT to build their own business and basically just rent space from me - I have a whole private room available and all equipment available and could add them to my current EMR, etc.  in my mind this is an extremely turnkey option for an OT to get “uncaged”. (I win because having both disciplines seems more marketable and also from receiving rent) 

However the only OT I’ve actually talked to about this was just so negative about the idea that OTs could build a caseload and how much easier it is for PTs.  

Can any uncaged OTs comment on if you were able to build a business as OT in a brick and mortar space? 

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** That’s too bad they were negative about a great opportunity.  Some things to consider: Have you been collecting data on how many of your patients would benefit from OT?  Or how many calls and referrals you’ve have for OT and had to turn away?  What are the other OT clinics doing in the area?  WHO are their clients?

> **Response 2:** I’m an OT who’s owned an OON clinic for 4 years and have a PT & OT on my staff. I honestly have realized that clients don’t care what the letters are behind the name of the person treating them, as long as they can get the help they need and they connect well with the providers. I do think PT has done much better in the marketing sector in what PTs actually do (even in acute care environments, so many assume we’re PTs), but overall, it’s not more difficult from a business standpoint!

But other times I can knock out a whole day's worth of notes in like 5 mins. And. I was real hopeful that I could use it on a tablet during sessions but it did not work well at all. Maybe my tablet was too old...anyone able to use it on their tablet? If so what tab do you have?

I am debating between the two. My goal is to add something effective for back pain patients. 

Any input is highly appreciated.

TIA🙏

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I second the FCS shoutout that David Harvitz gave. It’s literally 95% of the reason I decided to start my own practice. It’s the single most powerful technique I’ve come across. When I first heard about it I thought it was too good to be true, but fortunately, I couldn’t have been more wrong. I’m not sure about FDM, but in FCS we’re addressing ALL fascia tissue throughout the body. Not only musculoskeletal tissue, but nerves, arteries, veins, etc. As a result, we can address more than musculoskeletal complaints. I have people come to me for IBS, fatigue/post COVID, anxiety, and a slew of other non musculoskeletal complaints. I probably sound crazy, but if I were you, I would take the first class and see if it piques your interest. Feel free to message me with any questions.

> **Response 2:** I've taken all the FCS courses. I help teach them and now host those classes. It is the most powerful set of techniques I've ever used in my 15 years as a PT. Worth every penny.

Hey gang! So, long story short, I am emotionally compromised when it comes to a personal injury and I need your input. 

10 weeks/p AC sprain, likely type 5. Initial x-rays looked like it was a 2 but Ortho said 5 based on how prominent/mobile AC is (I agree). Full motion currently with minimal pain during ADLs. 

My only concern is the joint hyper mobility especially while sleeping causing some pain in the morning that is consistent. I also can press about 60 percent weight in the gym out front and overhead. External rotation in an outreached motion also hurts. I also feel some separation/pain during these movements. This has gotten a bit better the past week. 

My schedule really only allows surgery mid-December otherwise I round trip a potential surgery until next year. Doc thought the outcomes wouldn't change a whole lot waiting a year (if I did do it). I actually disagree here albeit not by a huge margin. 

Any thoughts? Advice? Do it? Don't do it? Type 5 isn't usually treated conservative and information on this is limited.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Brace it and try to minimize irritation. Not worth it. Wait till surgery.

> **Response 2:** Thomas, I think your decision should be based on your long term goals.  if you’re going to wait on surgery, then you know that your rehab has to be top-notch. Not only stabilizing everything around the AC joint, but making sure that you have proper mobility through rib cage thoracic spine, scapula and GH joint so that AC joint is not further strained to accommodate the lack of motion at those areas.￼

Hi everyone. Looking for a PT in the Baltimore area who is comfortable and competent in treating athletes competing in barbell sports. I have my biggest comp of the year coming up in 16 weeks and could use some extra support in dealing with a few tweaks so I can push as hard as possible. Does not need to be insurance based and would prefer to be referred to an individual rather than a “sports clinic”. Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Evolution sports physiotherapy.  Morgan is a fellow there and has a pretty awesome clinic that even has strongman as well as Olympic equipment.  Crazy smart guy

> **Response 2:** Eric Schneider he is part of the uncaged group. 30 years of experience. Excellent therapist

I just got quotes from HPSO and CM&F for professional and general liability. HPSO is over $300 more. I currently have an individual policy with HPSO but it has taken me forever to speak with an actual person. CM&F I usually am speaking to someone within minutes. Before I purchase, is there anything else I would need liability wise? I discussed this with my insurance agent and discussed getting property liability but I’m renting a room and my inventory shouldn’t exceed $1,000 to start! 

Curious who you all went with and why. Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m planning to switch to CMF from HPSO. HPSO has been a bear to deal with, I haven’t been able to speak to anyone about added coverage, literally no one will answer the phone or return calls. And it’s more expensive than cmf.

> **Response 2:** Berxi was more affordable and could include general. Highly rated as well

Has anyone purchased a really cool converted vehicle like school bus or RV for their mobile practice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m dying to do it. For years I’ve wanted to get a C Class RV and convert it, and then just park by the big aerospace companies in my area so their employees can come out and not waste drive time to get work done.

> **Response 2:** There was an OT in Canada who converted a bus into a sensory gym. She did therapy and also rented it to moms groups, birthday parties, etc. 

I think she’s doing other stuff now, but her bus was awesome! 

Side note:
Make sure you have an electrician do the wiring… there have been a lot of bus fires in campgrounds from the DIYers.

Struggling on this end.  Paralyzed by self-consciousness, fear of failure and fear of the unknown.  Major imposter syndrome.  Also sucks having no direct connections to rely on for legal, billing, entrepreneurship advice.  Having made some bad decisions on expenses already making it difficult to move forward.  Just want some small successes to help move along but mentally realizing all the things I need to do… overwhelming as hell.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Definitely not alone in that feeling. I’d say the vast majority of people here have had days, weeks, months like that. Just keep going. From what I’ve seen, people in this group are a good resource.

> **Response 2:** I feel like I could have wrote this. Reach out if you wanted to talk. I’m opening as well. You’re not alone, mistakes are made by everyone. This has been done by many before us and if they did it we can do it. Scratch and claw until we climb out of that whole. Find someone to talk with. This is a very lonely road in the beginning and it can be daunting.  I’m there with you.

What are your thoughts on shockwave therapy? For those who have experience using it, do you feel it could be beneficial for wound care? I’ve done quite a bit of research, and there’s some emerging evidence suggesting it may be effective in promoting wound healing.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use the SoftWave which is broad focused electromagnetic. I did an insane amount of research before purchasing and it's FDA cleared (better than registered) to treat non healing diabetic ulcers. I also use it for post partum to help with healing from trearing too.

Any recommendations for good night splint for plantar fasciitis that you have used or recommended to patients. TIA

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I once showed a photo in another PT-related FB group (back in 2018) of a very simple kinesiotape technique that I have used with clients dealing with plantar fasciitis.  I always had clients report that it helped tremendously.  In fact, with the photo I stated that I used it with a current client and that both he and his wife reported that he slept the best he had in many nights; and with very very little pain.  I got LAMBASTED in this group for making such "ridiculous" claims. 🤣  But, if you want to know, I have always used a simple "navicular sling" technique with kinesiotape.  Even personally, I have found it to help with pain at night/pain first thing in the morning.

> **Response 2:** i just went through looking for my patient when the DPM recommended a cheap ACE; he said the expensive ones that pull a lot end up not being used with poor compliance; so he gave her the choice to buy a less expensive one to see if she could adapt at night; so far so good; you need to be able to safely walk to the bathroom without having to take it off; so consider age and strength

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same. Been using it. I wish I transitioned to it earlier. I had a separate one. Now my team can just directly upload it with ease.

> **Response 2:** Never an issue, we’ve been using it for over a year. I will say we check out sent log twice a week to see if anything ‘failed’ in sending. There are occasionally failures to send in there due to connection issues but that’s standard with any fax system and it doesn’t happen often.

**Community Responses:**

Our clinic has business hours posted but we don’t have a large volume of patients so we may come in later or leave earlier if we don’t have anyone, or if we are doing some marketing during business hours

Hey I would really like all of your opinions!  I am hearing up to open a brick and mortar location, with PT and sime other services.  There is a location that I am looking at in a small shopping center.  Price is good, but not really a desirable center with a 7/11 and a few other shops.  On the other hand it is very centrally located in the middle of tons of housing, next to my kids school, next to a park where all the kids play baseball and soccer.  Do you think location and reputation will make people look past the rest of the shopping center?  All advice is appreciated!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Ask the other tenants how they like being there…. And what their interaction with the landlord has been. Consider also how safe you feel coming and going there by yourself at night. Also look closely at parking. Very closely. That can be a big deal breaker for patients if the parking is sparse, or they have to walk far to get to your suite.

> **Response 2:** Always remember. Location. Location. Location. Would you be going there or your kids? Parents if you will have therapy?

I’m starting a small cash-based speech therapy side hustle and need to choose where to open a business checking account. I’m curious about how people usually pay for cash-based services (actual cash, checks, credit cards, Venmo, PayPal, etc), and if it still works to use online checking, such as Novo, when people pay cash. Wondering if brick and mortar banking is more convenient,  but of course I want to avoid fees.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use US Bank. Found all the other big banks had too many fees. Credit unions can be a good choice as well. Patients pay me through cash, check, debit/credit card through Square, venmo mostly.

> **Response 2:** Credit cards. I would never want to carry cash. Plan your rate with credit card fees in mind.  I personally don’t like it when businesses charge a credit card fee. So I just “include” the fee in my rates.

Superbill question.  

I'm a PT working in home with infants, fully OON.  I charge a flat rate regardless of session length.  I use Jane and don't have many families wanting superbills, but when I do I had initially been inputting codes without itemized costs and it generally worked.  Now I have my second case asking for itemized cost by code.  My visits are most often around an hour so I just divided my flat rate that way and it worked for the previous baby that always worked out to 4 units, but this baby's visits have fluctuated more, so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.  If I say it's 31.25 per unit that works for most sessions but there have been some with only 2 or 3 units but I still charged 125... so there is a gap.  

Doesn't seem correct to keep changing the itemized code cost.

I keep seeing people say to use prompt pay discount to arrive at their flat rate fee, but that would require me to falsely jack up my itemized cost and always then discount it (by varied amounts)?  
... But that also doesn't seem right

Sorry for the overexplain, hopefully it made sense.  Thanks for reading! 😅

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been there too… I unfortunately just charged a lesser rate (2-3 units instead of 4) for those sessions. It doesn’t happen often.

> **Response 2:** I would make your itemized cost equal per unit and equal the lesser unit amount and then apply discounts if the unit amounts were higher than anticipated.  E.g. $125 cash typically gets 30 minutes or 2 units, but I went for 38 minutes this visit and per 8 minute rule I could charge 3 units, but I gave a discount for the third unit, so no charge for patient Ed, but charge for neuroreed 1 unit at 62.50 and therex at 1 unit 62.50 rates. Pretty sure you can have void units on activities you don't want to bill a full unit on Jane e.g. 7 minute activity is 0 units, but still doc the activities and cite it as no charge 😉 just follow 8 minute rule, match number if units to total time (60 minute session is typically 4 units),  err on side if caution. People are usual pleased with discounts or write off, but frown in session to session breakdown discrepancies like there 1 unit was this amount and now it is more expensive... hope this helps

We tried packages but it didn’t work as great as per visit since we work with older population and often they have changes in their conditions, required hospitalizations for other reasons, etc. I hope it helps 😊

> **Response 2:** I strongly encourage you to reverse engineer your rates.

How much do you want to gross per year? Divide that by 48 weeks, then by how many treatment hours you want to complete per week, and you'll have your per session anchor.

We bill as an out of network providers and still figuring out what can we do if it’s not a Medicare advantage plan.
If our self pay rate is $140, and we bill the insurance and gets reimbursed $80, can we then bill the patient the difference?

Some plans do say that after deductible is met they covered 100% after deducitbke is met, but it’s still like $80. Can we balance bill even though it says that the plan will cover 100%?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How do you bill out of network with non Medicare advantage? 

Do you just provide clients a superbill or with like UHC or BCBS you just submit billing for them and send a w9?

> **Response 2:** It should say on the bill what they allow you to charge based on units if they pay 80 they will probably say the patient owes a certain amount and u can charge them whatever that says

All guidance/opinions welcome and would be greatly appreciated! 

I’m a mobile physical therapist that owns my own mobile clinic and I’m the only employee…therefore, I am doing all the billing through my EMR system, scheduling patients, administrative work and of course, treating patients.
I started my clinic one month ago and already have a full schedule working 8-5 Monday through Thursday.

I am only in network with Medicare right now and do cash based for all other patients but provide them with a superbill upon their request.

I am trying to decide whether to become in network with Blue Cross Blue Shield or stay OON. 
How difficult are they to work with? (I’m in Kansas) 
Do you typically see better reimbursement from them than Medicare?
Almost all of my cash patients (about 3-4 patients) pays the full amount upfront… would I be chasing Payment down from patients or do you typically see that patients do a good job of paying their remaining balance whether insurance pays very much or not? 
Would I have to pay attention to an amount that I would need to write off if BCBS does not pay the fullamount or do my patients pay the difference between the billed amount and what Blue Cross Blue Shield pays?

Thank you for any insight and your opinions on whether I should become in-network or stay OON with BCBS. I am very new to this and don’t want to get in over my head as I don’t want to feel like I can’t keep up with the billing side as well as treating patients. 

P.S. thank you to everyone for all your posts which helped encourage me to step out on my own… I’m absolutely loving it and it is the best thing for our growing family now and in the future 😃￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** OON /cash.  Best combo

> **Response 2:** Came here to say if you’re full at one month. Then every insurance gets the finger.  Stay out.

This is the decision from United Seniors Association, Inc. v. Shalala and used as a major reason for why Cash PT to Medicare patients is not allowed.

Chevron was overturned by SCOTUS yesterday. The entire conversation around cash PT has changed. What exactly this means… who knows. But the conversation has changed, bigly.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** What is the source for his comment "used as a major reason for why Cash PT to Medicare patients is not allowed." 

From my perspective the cart may be before the horse - as during the time when the PT rumors starting flying around about "cash and PT" when the HITECH law was put in play........ (not true - no secret clause" - that invokes Medicare and cash).

> **Response 2:** Hope this discussion isn’t limited to just PT and includes all therapies.

Hello. Now that I am credentialed with Medicare, will I need to be credentialed with each separate Medicare advantage plan such as Aetna Medicare in order to fully be paid?Thank you.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi. Crucial clarification here: Is the Aetna plan a supplemental? (I think it'll say so on their insurance card.)

You only ever need to be in network with the primary payer -- the primary payer will automatically send the remainder of the (approved) bill to the supplemental. You'll get a check in the mail from the supplemental later; timing varies. 

If the Aetna plan is their primary plan, then it's a Medicare replacement. Don't bother going in network with those, generally speaking, unless you have really good reasons. If their plan has OON benefits for PT, they reimburse at the same rates as Medicare would have. 

Please feel free to set up a call with me if you need more guidance -- since we've chatted about some of these things already.

> **Response 2:** understabd Medicare (dis)Advantage plans are NOT MEDICARE.  They are commercial insurance.  So if you are going to hassle with them then yes you will have to credential with each one.  Unless they have OON BENEFITS and you want to hassle witg that!  Good luck.  Sorry for my negative bias regarding said Disadvantage plans.  🤣

Will anyone share with me the form they give patients to sign if they have Medicare but are using you for cash pay? 
Thanks so much!
Edited to add: they already use medicare services but want extra hours of cash PT each week outside of their medicare services

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You must bill Medicare for medically necessary skilled therapy services. Clients are not allowed to pay cash for these services. If they are received wellness services (be clear on how you define this) that are not covered by Medicare then there is no form that they need to sign.  If the services might normally be covered but do not meet the skilled therapy medically necessary code outlined in Section 220.2 of CMS Chapter 15 then  you will need to have the client sign an ABN. Here is the link to Chapter 15 https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/bp102c15.pdf   Here is a link on how to correctly complete an ABN. https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/BNI/Downloads/ABN-Form-Instructions.pdf

> **Response 2:** Its a complete scam that medicare specificly names professions that can't opt out while saying others can for no reason at all. It's completely discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Hey everyone!
I’ve done mobile pelvic floor therapy as well as leased space as needed from a chiro office over the last 3 years. I’m ready to have my own space, especially as I can only see clients when the chiropractors are not in the office which is very limiting. 

After looking for the last couple of months (while turning away clients who wanted office visits when their schedules didn’t match my availability there), I have found a great option in my budget ($900 for 550 sq ft with waiting room, gym area and private treatment room, and bathroom, lease 2 yrs). This location is 5 min from my house which is amazing bc I have a 4mo old and 2 y/o.

The only catch: the space is on the second floor, no elevator. I’m currently only in network with BCBS, the rest of clients are cash pay. I was considering going in network with Medicare down the road but this would make that very challenging in the next 2 years in this space. I do home visits for newly postpartum moms. With my current population I don’t think this will be an issue, aside from moms who can’t bring their stroller in. I can always offer a home visit for anyone who is mobility impaired or postop, etc. I also don’t mind helping people carry anything up the stairs if needed.

Thoughts?? Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Second floor space with out an elevator would be a deal breaker for me. My first office space was on the second floor but it did have an elevator. I actually had a few that were fearful of the wk are and requested to take the stairs.  I decided with my second space I absolutely wanted to be on the main floor and I’ve had so many people remark about how much better they like it.

> **Response 2:** Oof that’s tough because it seems perfect in every other way! This was a dealbreaker for me because I didn’t want moms to have to worry about carrying car seats or strollers up the stairs (I’m also pelvic).

I work in a private practice that accepts insurance and also have my own cash business that is out of network. 

My question is am I legally able to provide super bills to my clients through my buisness since I am technically “in network” with insurance companies through the private practice

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can if you have a different LLC at different location

> **Response 2:** I don’t think so. I believe you still need the Npi of the treating clinician, which in your case is in network. So they would probably process it as in network or it might get denied

My understanding is when starting my own cash based PT practice, I will need an NPI type 2.

Pelvic PTs!! 
For those of you performing internal pelvic floor exams, how are you handling disposal of used gloves, chux, and other items that may come into contact with bodily fluids?

Are you treating these as regulated medical waste in your clinic, and do you use a dedicated biohazard receptacle and pickup service?

A fellow business owner asked me about this, and I want to make sure my setup aligns with New York’s requirements. Curious how others are managing it!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thank you!!

> **Response 2:** Every clinic I’ve worked in just threw the stuff in the trash. This is the same for working in acute care - if I patient had a BM on the floor or their chux were soiled with urine, it all just went in the trash. Even my gynecologist just throws stuff in the trash. It’s not the same as sharps as the risk of a stick and blood born pathogen spreading are so incredibly low.

Calling Scoliosis certified therapists! 

I'm looking to get certified either this year or next. 

Opinions on Schroth method or BSPTS- North America/Rigo method????

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Which one is Schroth vs BSPTS? I couldnt find it! Link please 🙂

> **Response 2:** I’m doing Rigo and it’s based on the Schroth method (I believe Dr Rigo worked with Katerina Schroth), they’ve just made some updates over time based on research and experience which is of course a good thing. I don’t know how different they are, I’d say do whichever is easiest based on travel for courses and cost.
My patients still come to me for “Schroth”.

Best advice for soccer cleat fitting? Any key points? Patient with plantar fasciitis.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Don't go cheap. There are literally zero support in those. Some of the higher end shoes have much better support on the bottom and in the inserts.

> **Response 2:** The stud pattern can make a big difference. Soft ground for wet fields, AG or round studs for turf. 

If they need wide fit, new balance usually has more options. Every brand will have several models that fit differently. Some insoles are really cheaply designed even on the high end cleats.

I'm considering red light therapy to add to my wellness business.  I currently have limited space due to the business being part time while working for a physician group.  I would like to use for multiple types of conditions.  Also, considering  esthetics in regards to anti-aging. There are numerous at home FDA approved devices and medical units as well. 
What has been successful in your clinics or mobile practices?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t find red light is a big money maker… more of an add on. Red light units aren’t that expensive and are best for regular use so most people will just purchase on their own. I have patients try it in session and then I recommend one for them to purchase

> **Response 2:** Following because I just got one that is somewhat new technology and can let you know how it goes once I actually get it set up and implemented. I'm going to have the same space problem so hopefully it'll work out till my least is up in May

Just sharing a feel-good story, because it made me think of this group!

My daughter (1st grade) gave her first class presentation this morning, and parents got to go watch. She presented on the Barn own and made a 3-D model to go along with the presentation. She did GREAT - but the best part was, after her presentation, the teacher asked for Compliments and Questions. A few kids asked questions, but pretty much every kid in the class raised their hand to give her a compliment - on her model, her presentation, her performance. 
It was SO COOL seeing these kids lift her up - she's normally very quiet in school, so this was a big deal for her to use her voice in front of the whole class. 
One older girl even told her 'You should be an entrepreneur'!  
Huge realization for me - how important it is for us to recognize our peers who are putting themselves out there, to acknowledge their efforts not just when they meet the greatest goals, but just the showing up! And to encourage each other!
It made me think of this awesome UC FB Group! - just wanted to say Great Job, You've Got This, I see you and you're killing it! to all of us putting in the grind every day, and especially those of us who are newer to entrepreneurship and just finding our voices!

Hey y’all quick question! I’m in the VERY beginnings of a mobile OP and wellness clinic. I’m in Texas so for PT I will need to obtain MD orders within 10 days. How do y’all go about this? Do you actually get a fax so it can be easier sent? And so you can fax documents to MD’s? I’ll be enrolling with Medicare so wondering if it’s needed. 

Also, am I allowed to charge a travel fee for Medicare patients? Or should I keep my territory for Medicare smaller? Thanks y’all! Figuring out overhead costs and territories right now.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Same boat as you… plan to start with Google Workspace templates until I get Medicare figured out… would love to get rolling with Ray Berardinelli’s system!

> **Response 2:** Most of Mars have faxing built in.  The best ones have POC tracking in place to help you manage it all.

I’m seeing a new patient who is in-network, but they have a high deductible. Since the deductible hasn’t been met, the patient will likely be responsible for the full amount. Although I’d like to charge them as self-pay, I understand that because I’m in-network, I must bill insurance according to the contracted rates.

For a typical session involving 4–5 units, how should I bill this appropriately?
This is only my third patient as a new practice owner, so I want to make sure I’m doing everything correctly.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You should have a fee schedule for what you charge per unit for each CPT codes. The amount they pay would be based upon your fee schedule and the units billed.

> **Response 2:** Ah ok, so their deductible hasn't been met, the clinic will charge based on their insurance carrier, that goes towards their deductible, say for instance $160 for the first visit and $130-70 the 2nd, until the deductible is met, then the co-pay kicks in.

How much does Cigna and United (PPOs) reimbursement for PT in FL? Wondering if it's worth it to go in network...
And how do you bill Out of Network? Just send the claim?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think at my last clinic UHC was like 50 bucks flat rate and I don’t remember Cigna but it was a little better. 

Out of network you just give them a super bill and they submit themselves. Don’t waste your time dealing with it

Hello! I am new here. I am currently working on starting a private pay outpatient clinic on my own. I live in colorado so wanted to avoid insurance due to the capped reimbursement with commercial insurances, but was curious what people’s thoughts are on being in-network with Medicare?? Is it worth it at all?

> **Response 1:** I did that prior to switching to health and wellness. Medicare was pretty easy to navigate and I was paid within 3 weeks and never had issues. I had one instance of a denial and I threw in a code to go over cap and was paid for those visits. Wasn’t my favorite but my location had a great deal of geriatric referrals. I did that a year and decided I despise all the rules, tracking down docs to sign notes, etc so moved to wellness instead. I’m also in CO. You can look up the par provider reimbursement rates online using the novitas online portal. If doing Medicare, I highly recommend signing up for this Portal, esp for any insurance verifications. I also heard that legally you can’t bill Medicare private pay for PT services so that was another reason I got in network

> **Response 2:** What type of clients/practice? If geriatrics.. yes!!

Hello colleagues, 
I recently applied with Blue Shield as an individual out-of-network provider so that my clients can be reimbursed through the super bill I provide them with. Since I operate as a mobile PT, I provided them with my virtual office address . However, my application was not processed because it is not a physical address. As a mobile PT, I do not have a physical address. If any of you have faced a similar situation, how did you resolve it? Did you provide a different address or find another solution? I was hoping not to provide my home address.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** There are businesses set up where their actual business is to act as a physical address for this purpose. I’m trying to recall what they are called. I’m also wondering though why apply to be OON. As a cash based therapist I’m just automatically out of network. I give super bills and then families submit them if they’d like to but their reimbursement as to do with if their plan offers OON benefits or not. Not me applying to be an OON provider.

> **Response 2:** I am in-network with BCBS so I could be wrong here, however it is strange that you would need to apply as an OON provider.

I work with many insurances OON and there way no application. Submit claims (or have the patient do it) and they will respond to the claims with era/payment if applicable. They may ask for a W9.

Called BCBS to find out why a claim was paid at $0 (no reason given on Ability). Tried typing claim number several times, no luck.. tried speaking it very clearly 10 times and it kept getting it wrong…. On the 11th try it finally repeated it back correctly and said it would connect me 🥳….. then it disconnected me 🤬

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have had multiple claims denied by BCBS recently and we have prior authorization for all CPT codes requested… so mad

> **Response 2:** Update: 30 minutes on hold finally got someone.  Was told that the correct status of the claim is being displayed in Availity (we use Ability as our clearinghouse) and they cannot give out the information over the phone and I will need to look on Availity

ROM and force measurement tools: 

I’ve been looking at the Meloq tools to give more accurate ROM and strength measurements, but they are expensive as all hell.

**Original Post:**
I've always offered complimentary discovery calls, but I'm going to hire an admin soon so I'll be shifting that responsibility to them. For other people who have made that transition, do you still call them discovery calls? I don't want to misrepresent anything and make patients think that they'll be speaking to the PT if they'll be on the phone with an admin, but I do want to keep the calls. I like to use them as a screening call to make sure they're appropriate for my practice and use them to review logistics ahead of time. Thanks for your thoughts!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** How are you currently wording it on your site? Could you possibly switch to a booking link that blocks out when you’re treating but allows for scheduled calls when you’re free?

If you’re wording it as “schedule free consult” or something similar I think you’d want it to be a therapist for at least the first part and then possibly transfer over to admin for the logistics piece.

> **Response 2:** Just a thought, that discovery phone call is a two way street. Clients are likely using it to determine if your personality, approaches, and expertise are a good match for them before they invest further. Personally, if I were going to seek out concierge style care (assuming you’re cash pay), I would want that person to spend a little time on the phone with me.  Just something to consider!

I recently hired 3 PTAs, which was very exciting. Two have been great. 1 is showing concerning behavior. She is lying her head down and napping in the clinic when she does not have patients while other therapists are treating. She will sit for 2-3 hours and not pitch in to clean the clinic if she does not have patients scheduled. We have a policy of no overtime unless approved yet she is the only therapists that goes into overtime. I was just told by another therapist that she fell alsleep while treating a patient. And the one day I left before her this week she stayed clocked in to get paid additional time when her patient left the clinic 25 minutes prior and the front desk said she "disappeared" for that time and waited to clock out late. How do you handle this? We just had a meeting last week on what therapists should do during down time, making sure therapist are clocking out on time, etc?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Document incidents, talk to the PT and set up clear objections to correct the behavior (if you want her to stick around 🤔) and check that she’s doing it. If she is in the probationary period and you don’t want her to stick around, fire her.

> **Response 2:** Tell her bye

I've owned a home health staffing company for about 7 years now and I'm feeling burnt-out.  I really don't want to go back to being a full time clinician but I'd really love to be getting a regular paycheck, PTO, regular business hours. The stress of being a business owner is getting to me. Going back to school is out if the question.  I'm not really sure what to do with myself.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Maybe a rep at a company that markets and sells equipment such as X10 or Lite Gait depending on where your interest lie.

> **Response 2:** I also own a home health staffing company and have been right there with you. It forced me to make some changes and now I’m barely involved in it and started another business. Stress is still high, but not like it was before. DM if you want to vent.

**Original Post:**
Wondering if anyone has ever continuously used ChatGPT to treat a patient? I have a PI patient whose attorney is refusing to seek translator services because “technology is enough.”
This patient had a consult with an ortho that refers to me and he said it was a disaster with communication because nothing was translating over correctly (Korean to English and vice versa). He actually told the attorney he cannot see this patient unless an actual interpreter is present and has not heard back.
Wondering if I should do the same or if anyone has had success utilizing it?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is a title VI issue. 

You are actually required by law to provide a qualified translator for this patient. Google translate it chat GPT or even a family member of the patient would not meet the requirement. In the event a translator is not provided, the patient could sue for discrimination. In the event of a poor outcome or injury, the patient could sue claiming negligence... which makes sense really. You can't treat without an eval and you can't really evaluate properly f you can't communicate.

The big sticker here is who pays for the translator. I've had to eat the cost when the Medicare is the payer since they won't reimburse for it.

You can Google and see some legal precedent. Off the top of my mind I can recall a case where an OBGYN was sued for discrimination for not providing an interpreter and another where an ER doctor was sued because a family member of the patient mistranslated something which led to delayed treatment and poor outcome.

> **Response 2:** Comprehend Health is an AI medical scribe that works with over 57 languages. It can listen to the conversation and input the transcript from the conversation into English. There are quite a few PTs in AZ using it now with their Spanish speaking clients and having good success. Plus it autofills in your EMR based on the transcript so you can truly focus on just treating. 

Like someone said above though, as a medical provider, I believe you have to offer interpreter services.

Would you like to know the secret to how people are getting ahead by making more money?

It comes down to how many hours they are working.

It's easy to think that wealthier people work crazy hours - more than we may want to do ourselves.

However, this isn't necessarily the truth.

One of the primary factors is that "richer" people have figured out how to "work" 24/7 instead of 40 hours/week.

In other words, they have created ways to make money while they sleep.

And they still aren't putting any more "man hours" into the week than you or I.

Want to learn ways to create this for yourself?

Our mentor, Greg Todd, will be hosting a FREE 5 day Challenge this coming week on **Building Invincible Income Streams**.

And we want to invite you to take advantage of his expertise!

It all starts Monday, March 6th.

***It's FREE to register!  The link is in the comments below.***

Why are we inviting you to this incredible challenge?

Because...

Your Success is our success!

The UNCAGED team.

Hello, my friend who is a female in her 30s had a stroke. She's located in Dallas and we are trying to find her the best inpatient rehab facility possible in Dallas or Houston to regain as much motor function as possible. Please advise. I'm an outpatient PT and am only familiar with TIRR in Houston. I am grateful for any facility recommendations or PT/OT connections in these cities.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** BIR Dallas (Baylor institute for Rehab) for IP in Dallas
Just my two cents but if she lives in Dallas…I would stay in Dallas for many reasons.  While TIRR is awesome, that’s a lot to transport someone all that way and then also friends and family not being there.  BIR is a great facility.  
Pate has an awesome day neuro program but that would only be appropriate once she’s able to be at home.

I am looking to possibly hire someone to lead various exercise classes. I am mobile, so the classes will be outside in a public park (there are SOOO many around here). 

I'm assuming I would pay the instructor as a contractor correct? Do I need them to sign a contract of any sort? If so, does anyone have an example of one I could use?

Also, how much cut should I give the instructor? 

Is there any other advice I should know about?

Yesterday, we shared Zach Schmucker’s story — a clinician who walked away from comfort to build a faith-led practice that reflects his true calling.

Today, we want to remind you of this:
➡️ You don’t need to have it all figured out.
➡️ You just need the courage to take the first step.

Fear doesn’t go away.

But *faith gets louder* when you start moving toward what you’re called to do. 🙌

If you’ve been sitting on the edge of *“Can I really do this?”* — Zach’s story will speak to you.

Hi everyone, I have given notice at my corporate job and in the process of creating an LLC to branch off on my own! I have a couple business names in mind, however, when searching online to see if they are available, there are a ton of different websites to check. Does anyone know of a legit website that will allow me to check if the name is available for use? Also, Does the name need to be available in my state (AZ) or nation wide? Thank you for any information!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Like most people here have said definitely check with the state when filing. Then once you have the name and logo try to trademark it or at least run a search before creating a ton of marketing materials.

> **Response 2:** When you apply for your LLC the site should have an option to see if the name is available in that state or it likely won’t allow you to create the LLC with that name. That’s how colorados was. Made life easy

Hi everyone, as a mountain bike coach now, (quit the PT corporate world 3 years ago!) I'm starting to prep for some down-time during the winter season.  A couple years ago I got some online fitness programs up on the Everfit app, but I'm having trouble with selling these.  My coaching business does very well, as I run a very large women's mountain bike club here in Denver, and get a lot of clients from the club and now word-of-mouth.  Trying to figure out how to now tap into the fitness market.  There's just so much out there to compete with, not sure what to do next to make my members and other athletes, more aware of the great programs I can offer!   Thanks!  I'm also about to finish a nutrition coaching certification with Precision Nutrition.  Anything to not have to be a PT anymore! 🤣

**Community Responses:**

This will be a podcast-style LIVE ***right here in the FB group*** to celebrate our 300th UNCAGED CLINICIAN Podcast episode!! 

***Post your question here below in advance!!***

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You spell it out with the words ailment vs wellness. It's uncanny how many "ailments" clear up when you simply work on the "wellness" areas of strength and mobility.

> **Response 2:** I’m a new grad PT in MN where PTs cannot treat “human ailments” direct access until at least 1 year of licensure, OR 1) I obtain referral from a physician 2) I collaborate with a PT thats been licensed >1 year.

I have an amazing opportunity to provide both physical therapy and wellness services at a local fitness studio on a cash basis. My plan is to request all clients to provide a referral by their first visit if they’re seeing me for physical therapy evaluation, but I also want to provide a la carte wellness services (taping, cupping, injury screenings) for clients after workouts without needing a referral. 

My question is the following: “Where do I draw the line between what’s skilled physical therapy and what’s wellness?”

I won’t be a year licensed until November. I want my services to accessible, but I also don’t want the board to come for my throat 😓

Hey Friends! Got my mobile cash business all set up and rolling and need a little input. Most of my clients are runners and cyclists, and I have quickly been approached by a local Triathlon team (100ish members) about becoming a partner with them as their “team PT”. It’s a super awesome opportunity, but has anyone done this before? Curious if you recommend any contracts or anything. Plan is to just offer a team discount for services to improve quantity of business and overall networking. Not 100% sure on numbers yet, but curious if anyone has input.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You could do a contract.  But, honestly, focus on building the relationship built on mutual trust and shared goals.  This will be a more authentic and fruitful partnership

> **Response 2:** I think the fair trade is discount for exclusivity. They would have to commit to that as a team then you'd have a deal if I were you

**Original Post:**
Reason #1154 of why I love working for myself and providing quality care and avoiding a big hospital…

After my client with Parkinson’s has been hospitalized for over a week with limited PT due to “short staffed”, the family paid me cash to come and get her sitting at EOB to finally get her in a position other than supine. 

Checking in at the hospital entrance for Covid screening consisting of a question, “Do you have any Covid symptoms?” was none other than… a Doctorate of Physical Therapy. 

I can’t imagine being part of a system that prioritizes physical therapists covering the check in desk over providing crucial healthcare services for which we have doctorate level education. I can’t imagine seeing a physician covering that desk. 

To top it off, they refuse to allow me to transfer into her power chair for prolonged sitting after I leave because of the liability of transferring her back to bed. 

Thank you to this group and its leaders for showing a better way forward. Change can happen. Keep pushing!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If this were my hospital, it would have been an OP therapist who refuses to do any acute care, but was flexed in the OP clinic and wanted the hours.Not very professional of a DPT, right? Or the manager who allows this. True story.

> **Response 2:** When COVID hit my husband, a physician, was a great team member of the hospital staff at times helping with Cna coverage. He didn't not contribute to his healthcare team because of his degree. He went where he was needed. I own my own mobile therapy practice. I help my clients if they need help doing things above and beyond my therapy goals if they ask and it's reasonable. I don't say "well I have a masters degree so I'm over qualified to....."I can understand your post against a "big hospital" but there's always ways in helping out for the greater good.

One of my favorite parts of the Uncaged Pathway and the leadership of Josh Payne, David Bayliff, and Kevin DeGroot is how they stress (and demonstrate) **serve first**.  I have taken this advice to heart and it has helped my business grow in completely unexpected ways!  If you have been on the fence about talking to one of them about joining the pathway, do it!  It might be the best step you take for your business 

Thanks for all of your amazing leadership gentlemen!

**Do you want to be let in on a secret?**

We were saving this for *UNCAGEDLIVE*, but it's just too good to keep bottled up any longer.

***We are making a ridiculous offer to new business owners*** attending *UNCAGEDLIVE*.

And, to be honest, we don't want you to miss out just because you couldn't be there.

In fact, *we are spilling the beans to you ahead of time!*

**So, what's the secret?**

As a special *UNCAGEDLIVE* offer, we are reducing the barrier to getting started in your own practice SIGNIFICANTLY.

How significant?

*Like, $2500 reduction significant.*

Why are we doing this?

In honor of Labor Day, we want to help more business owners to be able to get started in their own journeys.

And, since we are starting the 4th Quarter of the year, let's *BRING IT HOME STRONG! *

However, this offer isn't available to everyone for the taking.  

We are opening up **only 10 spots** at this *UNCAGEDLIVE* special pricing.

If you are ready to KICK IT UP, click on the link in the comments below to take the first step towards creating your dreams.

**Original Post:**
Seeking advice. Long story, any advice is appreciated. 11 year PT, home health and snf experience. 

This Coming January I'm going to need to take some fmla to be home with my son who is fighting leukemia (all is going as well, but it's a 2.5 year tx). My wife has to go back to work as a teacher in January to keep her job after taking an extended 1 year leave for our sons treatments. Fortunately, if all goes to plan, I should only have to take 3-4 full months off, then he can start going back to school. I'm in nevada, have my llc, type 1 and 2 npi and have dabbled in cash pay in home private services but home health has kept me more than busy and i havent pursued cash pay much. I'm looking at maybe trying to do some cash pay or considerin what it would take to do cash pay/ insurance hybrid while I'm off on fmla after my wife gets home from work. I live in a semi rural area but live 30-45 min from larger areas. How hard was it for everyone to build up a cash clientele and how hard was it for others to break into the referral/insurance realm? Any suggestions on where to start. I have some ideas but thought ideas from like minded individuals could be beneficial. I would like to just supplement my wife's income initially and return to home health ,but if things took off I'd not be opposed. These are just my initial brainstorming thoughts. I may opt to do a long overdue shoulder labrum repair and use some short term disability as well during that time. Please feel free to ask me any pertinent questions and any advice or good vibes to our little guy is appreciated! Picture of us added for fun at one of the local cancer foundation fundraisers!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good luck, prayers for you and the family 🙏

> **Response 2:** For me, word of mouth is HUGE. Most of my Clients have come from someone they know working with me. I would also use local FB groups to advertise your business and expertise. 

I have found the best medical providers to appeal to have been pain management doctors, and other PTs honestly. Many outpatient facilities could refer to you if someone who maybe has difficulty getting to PT comes their way, or maybe has some insurance difficulties, etc. 

Another idea maybe could be to host an event/ fundraiser on your son’s behalf and to raise awareness and maybe provide services or have a booth there? Maybe even provide edu on PT as it relates to CA? Just a thought I had. 

I wish you the best of luck and hugs to your little guy! ❤️

Hi! I became uncaged about 2.5 years ago and started delving deep into helping those with osteoarthritis particularly knee and hip osteoarthritis 🦵🏽

I started focusing on online education for both patients and clinicians and just created a CEU course that's available for both PTs and PTAs. 

The opportunities are truly endless! The course is 5 CEUs and is on sale through the Labor Day Weekend. If you're looking for CEUs and want to gain a different perspective for treatments in those with knee OA- sign up link is in the comments 👇

***I literally just had a conversation with a PT friend who is considering starting his own practice because of the direction that the traditional world is going.***

His main concern? 

He said: "I'm sure you hear this all the time: Can I do it? Will this work? I know it's just self doubt."

Truthfully, I - and we - DO get that question.

 *ALL THE TIME*.

Here was my response:

"You are wanting to perform a magic trick - build something from nothing - and you've never done a magic trick in your life.  So, you're wondering if it's really possible to pull a rabbit out of a hat."

He giggled and said: "You're right"

And, like most people, he was also concerned about being able to provide for his family sooner rather than later.

My question is this:

If you are wanting to do something you have never done before and your livelihood depended on it, wouldn't you feel better about the journey going with someone who has already done it?

***With hundreds of others?***

I know I would be.

Come, Launch with us.  

We take off **Thursday, Jan 11th. **

Sounds like the Momentum Model Kevin DeGroot talked about in one of the semi-recent podcasts. Even taking a bigger break to step away, similar to the Mastermind retreats.

## Plans succeed with many advisors...

**Looking to have your plans succeed in 2024? **

**It would be wise to get around many advisors.**

Many advisory groups have been started by the APTA and other organizations, but to be honest, they seem to miss the mark of what a practice owner actually needs.

That is why we created Success Council's - A council of 6-8 practice owners across the country that are in similar revenue range and size to grow in connection and trust with. We say #ironsharpensiron, but the question is - Are you putting yourself around iron?

When you start to run a business, you start to quickly realize that the game that you are playing is vastly different than most people around you, and most of the time...family and friends simply can't relate.

This can be frustrating and isolating. We have created the community where you can grow your own personal board of directors as you grow your company. Other entrepreneurs that you can rely upon for counsel, accountability, collaboration, and support.

If you are interested, comment "Success Council" below! And then, we will get you all of the details.

**Community Responses:**

Now that you are uncaged, how are you all making your business a place where it’s not like these corporate corporations? How do you show appreciation for your employees? How are your processes and procedure tailored to your employees having a good work/life balance? 
Asking for myself and my company. 

Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** First of all, I am grateful daily for every single person that works WITH me (I don't say FOR me). I once heard, "it is a virtual miracle that your employees show up to work. They don't have to". So I make sure to say "thanks" a LOT.
#2 I ASK them if they can take patients. I don't do their scheduling. I treat them like the intelligent, competent, adults they are. No one likes to be micromanaged.
#3 I don't believe in productivity. In this field, it is absolutely unwarranted and ruining healthcare. 
#4 I ask how I can be of service to them. It is my belief that as admin, my job is supporting the staff in the field. (I own a home health staffing company). It's not easy to drive from patient to patient, call doctors, communicate with the care team. If I can make their day easier by doing a menial task, I do it!
(I should add that everyone who works with me is an independent contractor and has complete choice over their schedule. As a 1099, I'm able to offer them more freedom)

> **Response 2:** Ooooh this is such a great question 👏🏼 
I’m a solopreneur, but I’m excited to hear everyone’s answers! 

I take hikes, work outside, say no to businesses that don’t align, and strive to eventually be “a job maker, not a job taker”

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hello dear fellow PT’s and businessowners!!
I have been a PT since last 13 years in United States. However due to restrictions on my Visa I could never own a business 😞 
To run my own clinic has been my dream ever since I graduated from school. I am finally at a point where I could start my own clinic (have authorization from Immigration) 
My Challenge - I feel I have lost my skill set especially manual therapy since I worked with geriatrics in the same setting (CCRC) last 13 years.
I feel I still have the passion in me but I’m very nervous to leave the comfort of a regular paycheck and also having less time with my 2 little kids. 
Thank you for the support and guidance from this group.

> **Response 2:** Hello everyone! I’m at the beginning of this journey and am excited. I am a physical therapist in NJ (central/northern) with orthopedic background and recently pursued a certification for pregnancy and postpartum exercise correction. I have registered my business and working through the preliminary legal and background items. I plan to be mobile until I can have a location. My biggest challenge right now is getting over my own fears and self- limitations. And also making sure I understand all the practice act and legal/business side of things so I’m completely covered. I’ve already learned so much from reading through some of the posts. So looking forward to all the knowledge I can gain from this group as well as offer anything I learn along the way.

I’ve been hesitant to share this but i want someone to feel inspired and get the drive that YOU CAN DO IT!! 
I am coming up on my 1 year anniversary of taking the leap of faith on quitting my very safe and steady job to pursue my dream of opening a brick and mortar practice of Grow With Me Pediatric Therapy LLC  Before I did this I listened to almost EVERY Uncaged podcast and had a brief talk with David Bayliff. I knew my area needed a pediatric practice, but man was the thought of me doing it scary and daunting. This group along with support from families and friends  gave me the motivation and determination that I could do it. Honestly, that 5 min talk with David was a huge boost for me. I’m so thankful for this group!! 
In 1 month we will have our first anniversary. We just won “Best in Bulverde for rehabilitative services” in my small town and my clinic is equipped with the best providers (5+)  I could dream of 🥹. 
It has grown faster than I could have imagined, the Lord is good y’all! 
I’m not going to lie, today I was in actual tears from the hard work - it is blood, sweat and tears. It is not easy but IT IS WORTH IT!  
I owe so much to this group, even from being behind the scenes and learning from everyone else. Read every post you can and listen to the insightful podcasts!
So if anything, take this post as your drive to DO THE HARD THINGS! 
Here was my motivational thought process the entire time: “my area needs it and someone is going to do it, so it better be ME!!”
Thank you Uncaged Clinician and David, I’m growing the dream!  💚

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Melissa! I am smiling so big for you right now!! So happy for you that you displayed the courage, the boldness, and grabbed hold of faith to do this!  And NOW look at you!! UNCAGED!!! AAAAANNNND winning "Best of" ... and to think that you doubted if you could even do this.  Bravo! BRAVO!!!

> **Response 1:** Please share and help if you can. One of my PT professors and business mentor had to evacuate and left his home without anything. His clinic also burned down. He is such a kind and selfless person. I checked in on him and he said despite everything that happened he considers himself lucky and wants to go out and help as soon as he can to help rebuild. This week has been so heavy. His words brought some light. But it’s still so difficult. So much devastation.  And also so much community. Thank you for the love and prayers. LA still needs it 💔♥️💗

> **Response 2:** There should be a general pt
Disaster fund. Blew out my knee last year volunteering, havent been able to work bc of the severity of the injury. Plus the amount Ive had to pay out or pocket for rehab, what id there was a pt swap service or bank

Has anyone built out a facility for your business?  We just got property to build an indoor mountain bike training facility in Denver! 😃🙌🏼 Will be doing mountain bike coaching, as well as putting a gym in it to do personal training, group fitness classes, maybe some cash-based PT.  

Does anyone have resources for blueprints on building a small sports complex/training facility?  We aren’t quite sure yet what’s the most cost-efficient way to start.

**Community Responses:**

I have zero experience here but I hope you find the right person, and I’ll be cheering you on!

**Original Post:**
I am currently a Medicare/ cash mobile PT in Florida.  I have been growing for the last few years, but exploded this January when I started to take Medicare (even though that is only about 30-40% of my business).  

I have a PTA starting in July, and will ramp up my marketing in the next week or so to get her schedule filled. So far my growth has been word of mouth.  

I have found a brick and mortar that is near our small town’s downtown, and I have fallen in love with the space. But, I have no idea where I would start to figure out if I can make it happen financially, and fill it.

How do I go about projecting numbers/ financials for a new hire and a space.  Also, things like.. is it a good size, a good price (i have looked at other listings nearby and it is comparable)? Is there a way to objectively figure out if it will be profitable enough to incur this new overhead and possible headahces associated with leasing?

Also is there a magic formula to determine when I am able to “afford it.”.  I.E. 3-6 month emergency fund (dave ramsey style), have a wait list, have a certain % in savings, etc. 

Thanks so much.  I am super comfortable with being mobile, and it is working very well. However, I am a dreamer and this space has me thinking of ALL the possibilities for growth.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Cautionary tale here. I overestimated how many non insured or OON clients I would have and have ended up with 95% Medicare. I am not even close to covering all of my expenses and am now trying to break my lease after only 2 of 5 committed years w/o declaring bankruptcy so I can shift to a less expensive location. Covid really changed building occupancy. I was told my building was 95% leased. The building is practically empty because entire floors are empty. I don’t get the young professionals in I was anticipating. Construction started across 2 streets and took all of the parking I thought I would have. I should have fought harder for a true break lease clause.

> **Response 2:** You really just have to run the numbers. Come up with your average reimbursement per visit (and I always low ball this). Come up with what your expenses will be once you hire (and I always overestimate this). You can also underestimate how many visits you and the PTA will have total per week. If the numbers still work, then you’re good.

Distraction- the first of the great killers of your business. 

There's an amazing phenomenon that happens as you start to see opportunity around you. Similar to how you start to see the car you want to buy all over, opportunity starts to show up all over the place as well. 

As a staff PT, there's no reason to see opportunity so we often close off our minds to the possibility that there are opportunities outside the traditional staff PT position. 

More and more people are starting to see that this isn't the only option and that they can become "UNCAGED." Then they start a practice and hear all the different things that everyone in this and other groups are doing and there's a level of FOMO that happens that makes us think that we need to pursue every opportunity around us. 

One of the most important things that you can do as a business owner is figure out what's working, find the opportunity (not generally the opportunities) that you want to pursue and then focus and be engaged in that and not let yourself get distracted. 

People often think coaching is only for people who need help figuring out opportunities and strategy but one of the less valued but extremely important aspects of a coach is to help keep you focused on what's the most important.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** SO TRUE!! Many recognize that the greatest value in having a coach is to keep them focused! 🙌

> **Response 2:** When I did Uncaged Bootcamp in May, I was very worried about competing with a large corporate group in my area. Josh Payne told me not to worry about about it and that there was still a market for me. Well, three weeks into being full-time at my own practice and I hit my goal of 20 patient visits/week. Thank you, Josh, for the encouragement. I was very surprised and impressed that you spent so much time messaging with us individually.

**Original Post:**
We just got back from rafting the Grand Canyon and I had one of the most resonating experiences I've had in a very long time. Spilling my guts here but I think this group will appreciate the sentiment as well as anyone. 

When I was in college, I had the amazing fortune of working as a river guide for 5 years on the Colorado River, mostly in the Grand Canyon. That job prepared me for working as a PT and especially as a small business owner better than almost any other life experience. 

Rafting the Grand Canyon requires traversing a nearly 300 mile long stretch of river that includes some of the biggest whitewater in North America. We use these huge 37 foot, 4 ton, motorized rafts that can carry up to 20 people at a time. 

I applied for my permit to do this in 1997(!), which was the last year I guided and when I was first starting PT school. It's safe to say that I was going into this a bit rusty because there I was, 25 years later, piloting one of those huge motorized rafts, carrying 16 of my family and friends for 10 days, through historically low water.

As intimidated as I was going into this, one of the best things was how awesome it was to  F E E L the Support and Camaraderie from the other boaters down there, both private and commercial. Mistakes are going to happen and we need each other. Everyone has to camp somewhere at night and we have to unofficially coordinate who is staying where. 

The private trips were smaller and scattered around, most of them hadn't really done it before. The big commercial outfitters were pushing through with their huge groups, either in their motor rigs or with groups of up to 6 smaller rafts. But everyone is a part of the community. Everyone has to work together.

That feeling of support and camaraderie I felt in the Grand Canyon is extremely similar to what I feel in this user group. 
It's the feeling I get when I work with other practice owners who are trying to make their way. 
It's the feeling I get when I volunteer with the Private Practice Section of the APTA. 
And it's the feeling I get when I volunteer for our Home Health and Hospice Association or our local Climbing Advocacy Group.

With so many people running through the Grand Canyon at any given time, things could be a lot more competitive. Fortunately, it was absolutely refreshing and impressive to be a part of a community in which the guides and boatmen from each company and private trip work together to look out for each other. This was true for helping each other through the low water runs as well as for coordinating who was camping where each night.

I'd never seen water that low. Somehow, at every turn, another boatman had my back. This stuff is not easy. 
It's very technical. 
Sometimes it's extremely hot. 
Sometimes there are storms that bring thundering flash floods. 
Sometimes other people get stuck on the rocks and we have to help pull them off.

All of that feels extremely similar when I have random employment questions or regulatory or billing questions. The other 'guides' on our trip are incredibly positive as they rally with each other so we all get down safely.

There is an amazing community experience down in the Grand Canyon! There are also amazing communities here in Uncaged, with the Private Practice Section and with the other associations we have out there.  

Thanks to everyone for looking out for each other! What a cool thing to be a part of!

🔥🔥🔥Perspective🔥🔥🔥 so yesterday my back driver side (gas tank on passenger side) of my car was smashed while parked on the street. It’s prob totaled (it’s old w a lot of miles) but still drivable. So we were able to go out of town for the weekend as planned without a rental. I told me girls we were so lucky we were still able to leave without a hitch. One of my girls said “mom… did you forget the bad part where your car is smashed and you need to get a new one?” 🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠 well… no. That’s just life 🫠🫠

I can't believe I have a new car but sadly I totaled my 08 coming back from an ice age trail trip last year on poorly marked rural roads 🙁 cars are the new luxury item. if you can order new, it'll save you over buying cert pre-owned which I had to bc I was in a crunch and it was months to wait for a new car. You can also buy back totaled cars if the damage isn't too horrible or involving airbags ( I blew front and side, ouch that hurt but it saved my life against  1 ton work truck) .I hope you can keep yours running but by gosh, if you can't try to order a new one and not buy used...the used are more expensive

Hey everyone!

I own Atomic Physical Therapy in Boulder and Broomfield CO. We are expanding our team and looking for a running specific PT. The clientele is more than runners but we want someone who has an interest and experience with running to take over for my share of that caseload and grow into their own. If anyone is interested or knows of an interested party I can pass along the official job listing. 

Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

Motivating post… Was contacted by patient’s family member who is looking to hire a private practice PT. After talking with her, it became apparent she actually was never taught foundational knowledge of caring from a functional mobility standpoint (She had an extensive exercise packet that included ankle pumps, though). They owned equipment, hired caregivers, had two other family members and patient was being seen by home health intermittently previously. When I went over and met them, I was able to teach them how to do a two person transfer of the patient safely with a slide board from the hospital bed to their custom wheelchair. First time up in it in a year. It opened the world to them to know that they would be able to take her outside, tilt her back or do her hair, and it was really more about their piece of mine as well as the parent. In case you need to know why it’s so important that you all open good common sense, clinical practices, this is why! If there is anyone in the Fremont California area available to take on a lower level patient, DM me.

This journey has been so surreal - it’s truly a blessing on where Launch has arrived and what it is becoming.   It’s  hard to fathom what has transpired from the moment we spoke over 4 years ago to  now.  You have been there from the beginning and have seen this unfold from its inception.   You, Kevin, Josh and the Uncaged Crew have been all an essential part of the process.  Through all the ebbs and flows of learning to run a thriving business we have both grown and are transforming into something greater!  I have no words that can express how thankful I am for you  being in my life❣️

I truly cherish and love you like a surrogate brother - looking forward in what’s to come 🙏🏻

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Had one of my first patients offer to “help me get more patients” by referring her friends (she lived 90 min from my clinic) but wanted to trade her art for her insurance’s pre-set copay rate. Her art was not my taste, let’s just say. I also tried to explain to her I didn’t set the copay- her insurance company did and if she wanted lower copays she could just pay higher premiums. She did not like that. We parted ways after a few sessions when it became clear we were not matching well….

I just met a realtor who partners with other businesses. She meets the owners or managers and asks if she can pay for something like a danish at a local coffee shop. Then, she puts their logo and free danish on the front of the card and her info on the back. Easy way to refer someone and for them to see you did it. She’s built relationships with several businesses this way. Last week, I met a concierge pharmacist. She has “natural” pain spray in her pharmacy that costs $10. She agreed for me to partner with her. I’m going to purchase a pain spray for my clients who want to stop by her pharmacy. This way, I send her people who are customem to paying cash and she can do the same for me!  Just wanted to share.

I’m pretty sure I just made a referral source for patients w/ TMD chatting up the dentist at my appointment. The dentist seemed really interested in what I had to say and asked me to drop off a stack of my business cards for them to hand out to patients so unless he was blowing smoke at me I think I made a good connection. 

This is exciting since it will only be my second outside provider referral source I’ve made. I’m building slowly, but I’m steadily building. #BuildingBridges

I FINALLY made the first steps, created LLC, got a tax ID and got a type II NPI for Medicare. I’m now beginning the process of enrolling to be a Medicare provider. Do I have to do anything different if I want to offer PT and OT services? Thanks for any help

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** CONGRATS!! LETS GOOOO!! 💪🦁

Sue Doyle brought up the excellent points 👌👌

> **Response 2:** yes. You need to make sure this is the correct business structure in your state to offer both. Then your business NPI needs to be updated to note both. Then you can go ahead and apply for Medicare credentialing.  Make sure you have a compliance plan and policies and procedures in place.

2 positives yesterday 
A patient told her friend about our clinic…
1. “My friend is going to come to you because the place she goes now puts her on machines and walks away.”  “You stay with me the whole time’”

2. The  people at that other place are not very nice.

Times have changed significantly since 2016…

That is the year I started my practice - Freedom Physical Therapy.

I remember buying an ebook titled “12 things to do to start your practice” for $50 because I couldn’t find much information online about what to do. It was similar in nature to the free 10 step checklist we give out in this group, but that’s all there was at the time 🤷🏼‍♂️

Now, fast forward to 2023, and we have more information than we know what to do with at our fingertips!

This is GREAT, but it also presents a new problem: information overload. 

Information overload can be paralyzing, in fact, it actually inhibits us in most cases from taking action.

Last year, we saw this problem growing and growing, and decided to launch Uncaged Bootcamp 🥾. 

We saw the problem of a) new practice owners needed access to the RIGHT information, b) new practice owners needed access to the RIGHT AMOUNT of information, and c) new practice owners needed it at a price that they could afford to get the information and guidance they need.

That’s why we launched Bootcamp. 

And the first one of the year is kicking off on Tuesday, January 24th!

Myself, Kevin DeGroot, and David Bayliff will be coaching and teaching you how to set up your practice for success over the course of 4 weeks.

If you are interested, comment “Bootcamp” or 🥾 and we will send you the link to get registered!

This has been a long-time coming for us at Uncaged...

We have known since the beginning of this group that practice owners NEED community, and need support as you run a business.

Many advisory groups have been started by the APTA and other organizations, but to be honest, they seem to miss the mark of what a practice owner actually needs.

That is why we created Success Council's - A council of 6-8 practice owners across the country that are in similar revenue range and size to grow in connection and trust with. We say #ironsharpensiron, but the question is - Are you putting yourself around iron?

When you start to run a business, you start to quickly realize that the game that you are playing is vastly different than most people around you, and most of the time...family and friends simply can't relate.

This can be frustrating and isolating. We have created the community where you can grow your own personal board of directors as you grow your company. Other entrepreneurs that you can rely upon for counsel, accountability, collaboration, and support.

If you are interested, comment "Success Council" below and we will get you all of the details!

Hi everyone!
I am collaborating with a family-friendly gym to provide a workshop and then an 8 week class focused on pelvic floor and returning to the gym postpartum. The goal being that at the end of the 8 weeks, participants feel comfortable joining the regular group classes without discomfort, leaking, or doubting that they can keep up because they will know how to modify movements. The workshop will be one hour and used to draw interest to get people to sign up for the class. 
I would love your thoughts and ideas on what should be included in either the workshop or the class itself. This is my first time partnering in the community like this!
Thank you so much in advance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Try to offer it at a time of day where moms are most likely to be able to find coverage for the baby (e.g., evenings) - this was a huge barrier for me postpartum if classes were mid day

> **Response 2:** Fellow PFPT here. I think in the workshop I’d hit the what’s common vs normal piece first (leaking, pain, hyper mobility, etc). I just took a class where we talked about teaching people how to palpate sit bones and pubic and tail bone to help visualize and feel for a pelvic floor contraction. I like that since you obviously can’t do a real PF exam in a group setting. 
I’d focus on teaching some general recruitment, coordination, and relaxation activities focusing on breath, TA, and PF (canister). Then you can build on that with functional movement in your actual class. 
This sounds like such a fun opportunity for you!

Just in case …. I stocked up on needles … I’m assuming most are made is China? Never know what could happen with tariffs  Nov 1 (not a political post.. just logistical)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I order through and support idryneedle. It is PT owned, Paul taught kinetacore classes too! He has a variety of types to order. Idryneedle themselves I think are made in the US. Many options, I get a combo of idryneedle and APS.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Personally, success has been when I can disconnect from work and give my family my 100% attention. 

For the business, success has been when people tell others about me and how I was able to help them in ways the traditional healthcare model didn't.

> **Response 2:** I was a family wedding this weekend and everybody was asking me how the business was going. 
It brought up a conversation about success and how everybody’s definition of success is different.  
It used to be a purely financially defined word.  I think it’s so different nowadays.
For me, I feel my business is successful if it is bringing in enough financially to support me and my family, allow us to do some travel and go out for meals and buy gifts and things like that.  And if it is supporting me in that way without me treating patients every hour, then I consider that a big success!
I’m currently doing about 1% of my businesses’ treatments and the rest of the time I’m spending working ON my business.

Giving my notice next week. my “side” business is consistently averaging 13-16 (never less than 13) sessions a week (15 is my max availability for the week currently and sometimes I add an extra session).
My financial budget is 19. So I plan on staying PRN on my current HH job until I get there and feel comfortable. Currently there are 2 openings in my company already, so I expect they will need help, but my area is the most desired and likely will fill faster, and I am not interested in driving far. Trying to decide if (for safety) I should apply as PRN to additional agencies in the area…. 
Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Go all in!! You can always apply PRN later if you need it

> **Response 2:** I wouldn’t add another. Think 2x the competencies, learning modules, etc. You got this 💪🏻

**Original Post:**
Food for thought... 

I would have NEVER (successfully) been able to run 100 miles without two things...

TRAINING, and HELP FROM OTHERS!

Why is this important? Because running an ultramarathon is analogous to running a business. 

🏃‍♀️You will experience many highs 

🏃‍♀️ You will experience many lows

🏃‍♀️ You will have extreme moments of self-doubt 

🏃‍♀️ You will have seasons (or miles) of asking yourself, "why did I do this in the first place"?

🏃‍♀️ You will be gifted moments of triumph - unlike any you could get from doing anything less challenging

🏃‍♀️ You will prove to yourself that you can withstand the storms and be strengthened in the face of adversity

In my 8 years as an Ultratunner, I've learned a powerful truth: 

The best race-day performances come when I've invested the proper time into training, and put my trust in others (i.e. coaches, and people who have done it before me). 

Running a business is no different. 

You want the most enjoyable race? Or you want to enjoy your journey to business ownership? DO THESE TWO THINGS...

1. Invest in the time it takes to PREPARE for the hurdles you will inevitably face. 
1. AND for heavens sake - INVEST IN PROFESSIONALS who have BEEN THERE to help you! 

Looking for some guides who have been where you stand? Link in comments...

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** So sooo true !! That’s why I hired run coach ( even I am one ☝️) and business coaches  without them I will be lost 😞!! Thank you #uncaged family !! Love you guys !!!!

> **Response 2:** I’m running a marathon this year…the first thing I did was hire a run coach for the first time. Such simple and powerful advice here for anyone to take and find true success in life and in business. Thanks Kalyca Jin Zarich!

So, a crane fell on my building during Hurricane Milton and the fire sprinklers went off, apparently for many hours. Most of my electronic equipment and anything cloth or particle board is destroyed. Looks like this is me giving up on the brick and mortar side of the business. I will let the lawyers do their lawyer thing to get me out of this lease. I need to know specifically where in PCOS I remove my brick and mortar practice location and add "mobile" instead. Maybe I'm just exhausted but I'm not finding that in the tutorials. Thank you for your assistance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m so sorry

> **Response 2:** I’m so sorry you are going thru this!  I heard a crane fell up there.  So terrible 😢 my understanding with Medicare is that you just change the place of service to 12 if you are going to peoples home.  When you signed up in PECOS it was either mobile only or it was brick and mortar but that included mobile.  If I’m remembering from Tony’s class correctly.  I would also call the Florida Mac.  866-454-9007

We want 10 new business owners who are serious about Revitalizing Healthcare to work with us.

**Original Post:**
Here is an entrepreneurial story that I believe all of us can learn from:

There once were two bakery’s next to each other in my town. Nothing Bundt Cakes and Swirl Bakery. They sit less than 50 feet away from each other.

If any of you know Nothing Bundt Cakes, you know what you are getting when you walk in: Delicious cakes, ready to go, and a great experience. Everyone who works there is always so kind and ready to serve.  Ever notice how they even come around from the counter to greet you when you walk in?

Then there is Swirl Bakery: a fantastic bakery. They had cakes, cookies, cupcakes, scones, breads…everything you could possibly imagine. Everything was really good there. It was just an okay experience when you walk in, depending on who was working. 

So, what can we get from this?

Two things:

1) The power that comes from being EXCEPTIONAL at one thing. What is that for you and your company?

2) The difference it truly makes when you are greeted with a smile EVERY TIME you come in.

Now, I don’t know why they actually closed down. But, they were in our town for more than 10 years and I would be led to believe as a customer than 1 (or both) of the above reasons led to them closing up shop.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have Nothing bundt cakes here in Downingtown.  Love the cakes.

Today’s 3 Minute LION’s ROAR… 
Mission vs Metrics

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Good tip. The metrics emphasized should paint the picture of mission success/failure.

> **Response 2:** I like what you say Captain ! It’s a great reminder to always focus on the Mission of your business. I describe the acronym m.i.s.s.i.o.n.  for your business as to : mobilize, innovate, strategize, serve, inspire, optimize, and navigate! ￼Yes, there’s a lot of distractions with the availability of different systems that say they want to help increase your sales, etc. but I believe they would have to really know what your mission is and understand it as well as you begin to understand it in order to deliver the level of quality of service that you aspire to deliver to your customers! So I believe the metrics can come in later in your business when you have developed a solid foundation of principles in place to help you stay authentic and have good clarity!

Hi All!  I am so excited!  I was invited to be a speaker at my state chapter of an international woman’s organization for high achieving woman. When I said yes, they asked me what my speaker fee was. I said I’d have to get back to them 😳 This is my first time being compensated for a speaking engagement 🥳

Anyone comfortable sharing what they charge for a 30-40 minute talk?  

Do you charge your hourly fee? Do you include prep time?

Thanks in advance!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don’t have a set number in mind so I don’t know how helpful this will be, but I would consider both what you charge for your time to lecture and also how many hours of prep time will have to going into the lecture. So if you’re going to make a PowerPoint presentation and do a little research and think it’s going to take 3 hours to prep the lecture, perhaps consider that in your fee.

> **Response 2:** Following. I have the same question 🙋🏻‍♀️

Just spent an hour creating a virtual business card. Necessary? Meh, probably not. Super cool, with a bonus of touchless and eco friendly? You betcha!

There’s a great tutorial on YouTube, but basically it’s a free canva creation and it eliminates paper business cards 👍🏻

It’s TIME for you to find the community that you have been looking for. 

We are going to make waves 🌊 of change together in 23 days in Denver. 

This is not your normal “Here is a list of all of our amazing speakers” type of event, but so so so much more than that. 

It’s an experience that will provide you with TRUE momentum in your life and business.

Not the fluffy momentum that fades within a week after leaving the event.

Motivation is fleeting, but deep inspiration can last forever. 

You will meet a community that will be with you for life. 

There is an energy and momentum that God is building within this community that you really can only experience in person. 

23 days…LET’S GO!!!!

(Again…I tagged as many as I could based on what Facebook prompted me)

2023 Appropriations bill text released. Congress proposing to only offset 4.47% conversion factor decrease by 2.5% in 2023. This means we will have a 1.97% decrease in 2023.   

In addition, Congress is proposing to extend outpatient therapy delivered via telehealth through December 31, 2024.   

Congress did not insert any language regarding changes in supervision requirements of an assistant in the private practice setting.

Is anyone here all online with their business? 

 If so, and you used someone you are happy with to guide you through the process,  help you get your systems up and running,  and teach you the best ways to promote your business that have actually worked,  I'd love to know who you used!

I'm considering transitioning my mobile physical therapy  into the world of online fitness/wellness/nutrition coaching.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I haven’t taken my business fully online, but I’ve worked with a few people who were super helpful in streamlining my systems and improving my marketing. If you’re heading into online coaching, I’d definitely recommend finding someone who understands the wellness and fitness space specifically—it makes a huge difference. Also, having reliable automation and scheduling tools in place will save you tons of time. Happy to share a couple of names if you’re interested!

Question:  I'm an OT who recently launched a website, www.allplacesrehab.com, that allows therapists and therapy centers to list their services for free.  There is also an option to be featured for a small monthly fee.  I'm excited about the idea of having a platform for therapists and clients to connect.  I think it is a much needed resource.  As therapists and clinics owners, what would entice you to sign up?

**Community Responses:**

In fact, when I started my practice, the individuals themselves found me on their own and came with a physician referral-all legit. As an OT in my state it was required to have one.I had private insur & cash based clients .  👍🏼

There was a fascinating study that looked at the longevity of humans called “Blue Zones” by Dan Buettner and his team.

They looked at the highest concentration of areas of the world where people lives the longest.

Want to know the highest determining factor?

…

Yes, diet played a part 🍎, but wasn’t the biggest factor.

Yes, exercise 🚶‍♂️played a part, but wasn’t the biggest factor.

The biggest determining factor was…HUMAN CONNECTION and RELATIONSHIPS. 

The study deemed that being part of the RIGHT TRIBE was possibly the most powerful thing you could do for your health.

And Healthy people build healthy businesses.

So, who is your tribe?

And are you surrounding yourselves with other business owners who are where you are at and also further along than you?

Well, Uncaged Live is the beginning of finding your tribe. I haven’t met or experienced a more supportive, loving, caring group of individuals in the healthcare space.

It’s time to change healthcare through creating a tribe that helps us to make the change that we want to see.

Will you be there? 👇

October 6-9th - Denver, CO ⛰

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** your tribe affects your vibe 😉

Speaking of BEST OF.... Christina Marie Ramirez and her business partner, Camaron Chide Burney earned 1ST PLACE in PHYSICAL THERAPY in Galveston County (Texas) ...

How long have you been saying, “I’m *going* to launch my practice soon”? 

Weeks? Months? Maybe… longer?

Excited, but stuck. Dreaming, but not doing.

That’s exactly why we built **Uncaged Business Launchpad** — to help healthcare pros finally *do the thing.*

👉 The right mindset
👉 Simple systems
👉 Marketing and sales that *actually work*
👉 Confidence to launch your business the right way

We’ve got a few spots opening as our current students graduate 🎓

Time to KICK IT UP A NOTCH! 🕺
Congrats to Cindy Carron Weinberger who is becoming a grandmother!! 🥳
Dan Gallagher has passed on some smart cookie genes.  His son, Brayden, was the salutatorian at Colony High School and one of 43 out of 800 applicants to win the prestigious Davidson's Honors College, Univ. of Montana Presidential Scholarship! 🎓
We ain't done with Dan Gallagher's sons.  His other son, Nolan (twin to Brayden) committed to Carroll College for football! CONGRATS TO THE WHOLE FAMILY, DAN! 🎉
If you play golf and you a betting person, watch yourself if you are playing with Dan Kickel, father of Katie Kickel Hernandez. The man hit YET ANOTHER hole-in-one from 166 yards out! Oh, and that's after recovering from shoulder surgery! STUD. 💪
BTW, why do we highlight family stuff also? 
Because FAMILY is an important part of our lives!
Love how Lesli Jenkins, Irina Stiasny, Lindsay Rush, Jordan Fred, and Sweet D David Herzberg are kicking it up this week... by gathering in Breckenridge, CO along with Kevin DeGroot for an UNCAGED CLINICIAN Success Council Small Group retreat! 🙌
Stoked for Brandon Williams! He officially gave notice to the J.O.B., clearing space for him to start to grow HIS dream! LET'S GOOOO!!! 👊

Who is it for?
* UNCAGED Business Owners 🦁

I don't want to offer PT anymore. Only wellness and coaching. How do I stop accepting medicare, BCBS and aetna? These are the three insurances I accept.

Edited to add: is it necessary that I terminate or can I just stop delivering services therefore no more billing?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Looks like an "affidavit" has to be submitted to Medicare. I think I'm reach out to my MAC monday to get specifics. I hope getting out isn't as laborious as getting in. Medicare was easy, BCBS took over a year.

> **Response 2:** If you have a contract with them you need to terminate it. If it’s just out of network then you don’t have a contractual obligation.

Business owners…

1) Know your identity. 
2) Carry that into relationships with your clients. 
3) it will sharpen your purpose.

It all starts with identity. If you don’t know what values you or your business has, you will never be able to create a culture that lives out those values.

Despite all the rage online about different diets, what I love about nutrition is the basic rules for success always stay the same. 🥩 🍎 🥦 🍚 

You see, what I love about the truth is it stays steady. It’s unwavering. Always. Anything that is not truthful comes and goes, and eventually fades away. 🌊 

The rules for success in business also don’t change nearly as much as it seems. Sure, changes in the market can change different factors…but at its core, it stays the same. 

This is my second post for a second day in a row to remind you to keep it simple 😀.

21 days until Uncaged LIVE…Uncaged is a family.

And there is a reason why we don’t have a live streaming option…it’s a culture that you can only truly experience in person. 

My guarantee: There hasn’t been an event for Uncaged clinicians in our field like this one, not even close. 

It’s an experience that will have you walking away filled with inspiration, proof, knowledge, friends for life, and the understanding of how to build a business that is actually sustainable 💯 

It’s an environment that the person next to you, even though they may not know you, actually wants to get to know you and see you win 🥇 

We invest in eachother, we guide eachother, we mentor eachother, we build eachother up. 

Denver, CO October 6-9th ⛰ The mountains are calling for more therapists to join the movement that is changing healthcare…

Business can be simple.

We have been talking a lot at Uncaged about what it looks like to have a “boring” business.

A business that:
- 1) has a way to manage your money properly
- 2) brings in leads efficiently
- 3) Has a sales process that works
- 4) Delivers an exceptional service and is able to measure how effective the delivery is

We should be focusing on building simple, effective, and “boring” businesses.

Nothing flashy, which isn’t always sexy to business owners, but rather something that is truly sustainable for your business and your life. 

Which area above (1-4) do you need to work on becoming more simple, effective, and “boring”?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** ....all of these. 😅

> **Response 2:** 1. Part of the problem is getting reimbursed in a timely manner (HH therapy staffing. I bill the HH agency). As of right now I have $17,000 outstanding.

Ok…I took the plunge April 1!! And I’m to the point of needing to hire some help!! I’m mobile outpatient!! Can I get some advice…pay per visit? Drive time? Mileage? 

W-2 vs ICC? I’m a non profit not sure if that matters….

I have my own malpractice insurance with hpso, should I purchase his malpractice insurance or is there something else I should get? I’m sorry…please help!! I need help much faster than I anticipated. Thank you in advance and feel free to DM.

🎃 **Halloween isn’t just for the kids — it’s also our anniversary!**
Today marks **15 years** of Concierge Physical Therapists!

When I left my full-time PT job to start this journey, I could never have imagined it would grow into what it is today. Looking back, I’m not sure I could summon the same energy and long hours it took in those early years — but it’s all been worth it.

What truly makes this milestone special are the incredible partnerships we’ve built with like-minded physical therapists who share our mission:
💪 *“Your body deserves better.”*
Thank you to all our PTs that have been part of this along the way!
Here’s to 15 years of helping people move, feel, and live better — and to many more ahead! 🧡

Clarence “Kelly” Johnson coined the principle “Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)” in World War II when he helped his skunk works team to keep it simple when it came to the design of their top-secret stealth jets.

And much more.

The longer I am in business, the more I’m reminded to “Keep it simple, stupid”. 😃

**AW RITE! AW RITE! AW RITE!**

It's the First Friday of 2025!

Let's *KICK IT UP A NOTCH!!* 🥳

First, I want to acknowledge that I've been a little absent the past two weeks.  

Lesson: It's OK to not GO-GO-GO allllll the tiiiiime.  

That being said, today's list might be a little shorter than usual. 

But let's give ourselves some grace.  It was the Holidays!!

I hope you all enjoyed them!

Here we go....

Someone posted a couple of days ago if it really was viable to start a cash based practice.  Let's roll the tape on UNCAGED PATHWAY student, Matt Davis.  He is 7 months into the program and he just hired his SECOND person (one is a trainer, the new hire is a PT)! WAY TO KICK IT UP, MATT!! LET'S GOOOOO!!

Perseverance and trusting the process.  That's what Jessica Kerr did in 2024.  The result? In 2023 her practice, Allied Therapy Partners saw 138 patients.  That number jumped in 2024 to 914 patients served!! KICKING IT UP A NOTCH!!!

Also growing her practice, **NeuroAxis Rehabilitation Services**, is Kelsey Harris!  This Beast of Western PA is hiring both PT and OT to add to her already amazing team!!

Matt Bonander grew his Famousity AND his practice!  He appeared in the local *The Cross Timbers Gazette* about his practice, **Focused Care PT**, opening a new location! CONGRATS!

Also growing a big dose of Famousity was Jeremy Sutton! He appeared on a KSLA News 12 (Shreveport - Bossier City, LA) segment talking about the second edition of his book, *Neck Pain Solutions*! But, WAIT! THERE's MORE!  Jeremy appeared on the show a week or so earlier talking about ***Senior Day*** - a day that he founded where he treats senior citizens in the area to gifts, etc.! This physical therapy owner of **Healthy SBC** is going places!!

This MAY have been announced a while back, but Ashley Tunquist is going to be expecting her 1st baby in about 2-4 weeks!! 

Lots of people are growing, and I love it!! Eric Otero is growing his team at **Pinnacle Movement and Performance **in Delray, FL, and his looking to hire a PT!! LET'S GOOO!

In the Austin, TX area? My man, Stephen Dunn, is looking for a unique therapist to work in his manual therapy, Pilates, and Gyrotonic clinic!  

Shana Yap Townsend is a proud momma.  Her son, Jack, earned his Communications degree from San Jose State University!

Jackie Raymond DeLuca is riding high going into 2025. She got married!! CONGRATS!!!

Speaking of babies.... CONGRATS to Michelina Richardson Baker who welcomed her little man, Archer Michael, into the world!

Remember, unless you change something - a habit, a behavior, etc., then this New Year will be just another year! LET'S GROW in 2025!!

Make it a *fantawesome* weekend, everyone!

I'm excited to get back in the saddle!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks boss!

> **Response 2:** Hahahaha! I wanna see you in a saddle! 😂😂😂

Nothing like the feeling of handing in that "Bye, Felicia" letter to the J.O.B.  Big loud RRRROAR to Matt Davis who did that this week and is now fully UNCAGED!!! PUMPED for this UNCAGED PATHWAY member!! 💪🦁

Adding to his Famousity was Sarvar Pathan who appeared on the local radio station to do an interview about his practice, Personalized Physical Therapy and Wellness!! NNNICE! 👊

Jeremy Sutton, new owner of Healthy SBC (Shreveport, LA area) has also partnered up with Clint Davis Counseling & Integrative Wellness.  Bro, I love where you are going!! 🙌👊

How about Sherrill Williams launching her new podcast, *CHOOSE JOY Podcast*!!! BOOOM!!! 🎉

Susan Singer Langston is a proud momma.  Her son's Bentonville Wrestling Club received 2nd place in the State (Arkansas) for small clubs!! WOO! HOO! 🤼‍♀️🥈

Arlianne Scott is Kicking Up her team, Artistry in Motion (ABQ, NM).  She's looking to hire! LOVE THE GROWTH!! 🥳

Duane Scotti is feeling joyful.  He just ran a race alongside his daughter.  AWESOME, no doubt!! ❤

Folks, this is just a small sample!  No doubt there are many many more amazing stories from the week!!

I am so. Amped. UP! 

I know you all already download and listen to my podcast (Strength For Your Purpose Podcast for anyone who’s slackin) but next week’s episode will be with the CEO of Hancock Lumber (local to Maine). He’s so inspiring and as a business owner and leader I can’t wait to share this with people. 

Hancock Lumber is one of the oldest companies in all the US. It Started in 1843. And with his leadership principles that changed around 2010 they made more money from 2012-2022 than they did from 1843-2010

He also wrote a book we should all read. 

Go subscribe to my pod now so you make sure you get the episode next Wednesday! Can’t wait to see the Arizona crew Thursday!

"I lost 10 pounds in a week! Looking to lose weight before the holidays? Message me "fit for the holidays" and I'll give you information."

True store.  I really have lost 10 pounds over the last week stuck in bed with the flu.

Does this type of hook (attractive statement) sound familiar? We've all seen it. I've done something remarkable and want to share with others how they too can have the unprecedented success they've had. 

Does it seem too good to be true? 

Does it make sense to lose 10# in a week? Is that healthy? 

We want your business to grow and we want you to do it in as healthy a way as possible.

Fast growth can happen. We've had seasons of ridiculous growth in the past and some has been healthy but a lot of our fast growth hasn't been that healthy. 

It's not sexy to tell people to grow in a healthy way but that's what we're going to continue shouting from the rooftops.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sustainable growth and laying a rock solid foundation are key! 

Keep teaching the right methods, your reputation and client outcomes will (and do) speak on your behalf. 👏🏼

> **Response 2:** Hope you are feeling better

Hey everyone! Pretty excited - I just got an opportunity to have a booth up at a 5k race to offer free injury screens and short post-race stretching sessions. All I had to do was look up local races and ask! This will be my first event - any suggestions or ideas for me to bring or do? I will obviously have my table, sign-in/consent and business cards with me. Anything other ideas? Thank you in advance!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** People love show and tell. So any of your ‘gadgets’ that you can let them touch/ explore, they will be enticed to that. Freebies if they fit in your budget. You’ll be surprised to see how many stop by just for a free pen! But make them earn it. Let them do a few stretches to earn a certain freebie! I did a booth a while ago and the person next to me literally had people play the ‘operation’ game and then have them ‘spin the wheel’ to get a free hand lotion that they purchased from dollar store! People were lining up to their booth 😂

Hello Uncaged Familia! 👋🙏🦁 The past few days the theme of fear has come up and felt I had to share this with the group. It can serve as a motivation as we go into the second half of the year and use it in different areas of our life. How are you going to level up and/or find the courage to finally take that leap of faith? 

During today’s episode of Despierta America they spoke about how to conquer your fear when starting off as an entrepreneur and guess what they mentioned?!? It might sound familiar 🤔
👇👇
1. Imposter Syndrome 
2. Live outside your comfort zone
3. Accept setbacks and failures because it’s part of the journey of your growth 
4. Patience
5. Writing down your fears on a piece of paper so you can come to terms with them and then throw it away. This helps you to acknowledge them and to reset your mind.
6. Use your imagination to achieve a positive outlook in your life

**Original Post:**
Almost all of us have thoughts of “What would happen if I had to miss extensive work to take care of my family?”

The unfortunate reality is that very few jobs afford one the time or the ability to be absent for prolonged periods.

Such a situation typically would require the employee to exhaust their PTO (paid time off).

But, what if there is no PTO to take?  Or, what if there is enough to cover only a couple of days?

This can create quite the dilemma and a lot of stress, particularly if that person is the primary caretaker.

I.S. is dealing with this challenge today.

Her daughter and her husband are both battling COVID.  Her husband is rather ill.

That’s not all.  I.S.’s mother has been diagnosed with stage I cancer.  Her father is not in a position to care for her mom.

Thus, tending to the needs of three family members falls on I.S.

Having to care for her own immediate family consumes enough of her time.  Caring for her mother who is attending various appointments for her cancer is a huge heaping pile on top of it all.

It is pretty easy to see how I.S. could be stretched beyond too thin; particularly with a job that shows little empathy for her situation, and demands that she give her time to work.

How would you handle this?

Would you be frazzled? Stressed? Mad? Resentful? 

Probably so.

You know how I.S feels?

She’s grateful.

That’s right. Grateful.

Why?

After sharing the details of her current situation, I.S. concluded with this statement:

“*Thank God I have my own business so that I can have the time to take care of everyone*.”

She makes the rules.

Furthermore, she has attracted a clientele who serves *her*.  They do so in two ways.

First, her clients are who she enjoys helping.  Working with them is fun for her.  She doesn’t view her business as “being work”.

Secondly, they serve her by understanding that family comes first.  They are supportive of her during this time.

In other words, her clients fill *her* cup.

Wouldn’t it be fantawesome if we all could be so lucky as to have clients like I.S.’s?!

Guess what?

We - and *YOU* - can.

The only thing standing in the way of this utopia being a reality is you making the decision to make it happen.

And, you can.

Do you want to be able to create your own job where you can have the same time freedom and flexibility as I.S?

Do you want to work with clients who serve *you* rather than giving of yourself to your limits for seemingly… nothing?

We are here to help you to get started.

YOU having the control begins by clicking on the link in the comments below. 👇

WHY IS SEO IMPORTANT FOR YOUR BUSINESS?

I have to be honest, I used to be one of those people that never really trusted SEO or thought it was a scam, merely due to the fact that I didn't know what it actually was. But after going down the SEO rabbit hole, learning all the ins and outs, and now offering it as a service at Nogn, I've realized just how crucial it is for businesses.

But here are a few top reasons:
* Increased traffic from ORGANIC searches
* Best tool for local businesses to get seen - utilize Google My Business
* Builds Brand Authority - creates trust and credibility for your business
* Cost Effective Solution - relatively cheap compared to other marketing tactics
* Strong Long Term Strategy - more effective than PPC ads

You can read through the full blog on why SEO is important here: https://www.nognstudio.com/blog/why-seo-is-important-for-businesses 

Hope this helps clarify the reasoning for SEO campaigns, feel free to hit me up with any questions you have!

Uncaged PTs!! I would love your support and encouragement! I’m really putting myself out there and trying to provide a unique ConEd course! The course is a fundraiser, and all profits will benefit the Long Beach South Bay district of the CPTA. I’m attempting a neuroanatomy course with prosected brain specimens, looking at clinically relevant structures and pathways. How many times have we looked at CTs or MRIs or read reports about different neurodiagnoses? Would you like the opportunity to see some of those structures on actual brains? How many times have you tested smooth pursuit? Would you like to see the visual pathways beautifully dissected? That’s what I’m hoping to provide! Basal ganglia anyone? Limbic system? Cerebellum? I’d appreciate your encouragement…it’s a big undertaking for me. Thanks everyone!!!! https://web.cvent.com/event/3ec6d74f-b828-483b-ae39-2c0a37787226/websitePage:8c7824ea-808e-4723-8496-195f7370f21d

We’ve got the team for you, and the process, and have the room to be able to help a few more people this month. 

So much freedom comes from realizing that you don’t need to work for anyone else the rest of your life if you don’t wish to. 

If you or anyone you know is looking for a mentor to grow their practice, we would be happy to chat.

𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐚𝐲 🇺🇸

The unofficial start to summer. 😎 ☀️ 🏖 

A day that we pause and remember those who gave their lives and their freedom so that we may have ours. 🙏

We recognize those who currently serve for their bravery 🙌

It is also one of six days during the year that we look forward to because we get to have those days off!

Or, we hope to be lucky enough to get to have them off.

With the weather getting nice, today would definitely be one we would love to be able to spend it with our family and friends.

However, those days off are not always guaranteed. 

Question ☝️

Are you finding yourself looking forward to those six days out of the year when you can finally take a break - aside from the two weeks that you take off?

Do you feel defeated when you aren’t the one lucky enough to stay home and chill? 😖

Everyone else is enjoying the pool, a mid-day BBQ, playing cornhole or tossing the baseball ⚾️ around.

Except you.

You’re working.  Doing charts.  

Half of the patients will probably cancel - because they are celebrating the anticipation of summer’s start.

Meanwhile, you can literally hear the clock ⏰ as it goes TICK ……. TOCK…..

And you’re thinking “I just want to be home with my kids!”

If the clinic happens to be closed, it just means extra work for the rest of the week. 😩

I know. I was there.  For years.

Until I started my own practice. 

Exactly NINE YEARS AGO TODAY!

And my very first client?  I’ve been seeing her every Monday morning for those nine years!

Why did I start it?

For days like today.

I hated watching the calendar 🗓 and counting down the days until I could get that one extra day off.  

Now, I’m in control.  

My days off aren’t determined by government appointed Mondays. 

And, by NO means, am I minimizing the meanings of these days like today - Memorial Day 🇺🇸🙏

But I determine my days. 

And, you know what?

You can too. 

But I totally get how scared doing your own thing can be.  And, honestly, it’s NOT for everyone. 

But if you are having those itches, I’ll share these quotes with you:

“Failure is failing to try”

“Faith is willing to risk failure”

𝘿𝙤 𝙔𝙊𝙐 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙘𝙝𝙤𝙤𝙨𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙈𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝘿𝙖𝙮, 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙇𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙧 𝘿𝙖𝙮, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙮 𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙮 𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙨?

You can.

We have the 𝗣𝗔𝗧𝗛𝗪𝗔𝗬 𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗚𝗥𝗔𝗠 to get you started.

I heard a very powerful statement not too long ago...

"*The fastest way to not get to where you want to go is to try to get there on your own*."

That hit me like a charging elephant in the middle of the Serengeti.

You don't have to take my word for it, but I have seen it time and again those who try to go it alone struggle, burn out, or both.

Dreams and desires, when big enough, *are *challenging.

But even then, the journey should never leave you depleted.

The **UNCAGED PATHWAY Program** is the fastest way TO becoming *UNCAGED*.

Why? How?

Because we are with you the entire way. Giving you guidance, solving your problems, providing the knowledge that you need to create the practice that you want.

Chose to have our team around you now, and take advantage of $$$Savings.  ***The best price goes away Feb 1.***

*"From the core of who I am"*

*"God placed this mission in my heart."*

*"I do what I do because I see the potential in other people."*

*"To provide hope, because the world is filled with brokenness."*

*"To be a pillar of hope."*

*"To build something that serves the community and to move beyond myself."*

As Kevin DeGroot, Josh Payne, Kalyca Jin Zarich, and I have held board meetings with our mastermind students over the past two weeks, these are some of the amazing comments that these incredible people have stated when asked:

*Why do you do what you do?*

*Why is that important?*

We also ask them to rate how they are doing in the areas of the 5 F's:

*Faith *

*Family *

*Fitness *

*Finance *

*Fulfillment*

And what is interesting is that no one's level of fulfillment has been tied to their finance rating.

Perhaps because your business or your job should exist for you; not you existing for your job.

Maybe it is because, virtually, we have never had a student or prospective student tell us that they wanted to create their own practice in order to make more money.

Yes, making more money does happen to be a reason.  But it is never the first thing a person says.  It is usually at least 4th or 5th on their reason list.

In fact, one student even commented that:

*"Unless you are happy at your core, you will never be happy in your business."*

The 5 F's represent your core.

*So, I ask:*

*What is your Why? *

We would love to know.

Furthermore,* does your current vehicle *(i.e. your practice or your job)* have the ability to take you to where you want to be?*

If it needs to change, comment *"**vehicle**" *below 👇 Perhaps we can help.

"***Can't see the forest for the trees***" 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳

You've probably said this yourself hundreds of times.

Believe it or not, what can stand in the way of getting to where we want to be in our business is not being able to recognize in what cycle we are living.

Literally, we *can't see the forest for the trees*.

Understanding and seeing things clearly can make a huge difference.

Knowing which path to take will lead you to your destination faster.

The entire UNCAGED team is hosting a **FREE workshop Oct 3**.

We are going to help you to clear the smoke so that yo can identify your path to *Establishing Lifelong Fulfillment* and move ***Beyond Financial Success***.

Time truly flies! This was our SSHC Tennessee group, created and led by Greg Todd  back in 2018–2019.

We were just getting started back then — full of dreams, energy, and faith. And look at us now — still rocking it and winning in our own ways! 💪

Like we always say, “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” These were my above-average people, the ones who pushed me, inspired me, and believed in me.

We definitely need to catch up soon. Miss you all SSHC Tennessee! 🙌

Hello fellow therapists,

I just completed a telehealth consultation with a client who has dementia and is currently located in Edgewater Park, NJ.

I’m looking to connect with a high-level private practice that provides in-home Medicare Part B services. This client needs PT, OT, and SLP, and the expectation is truly skilled, evidence-based care—not just routine exercises, but thoughtful, intentional therapy that makes a real impact.

Their insurance is Medicare/Aetna.

If you know a clinician or practice that takes pride in delivering high-quality, patient-centered therapy, please reach out or tag them below. 

I want to make sure this patient gets the level of care they truly deserve.

Thank you in advance for your help and collaboration.

#PhysicalTherapy #OccupationalTherapy #SpeechTherapy #MedicarePartB #HomeHealthTherapy #DementiaCare #SkilledTherapy #GeriatricCare #TherapistsSupportingTherapists #EdgewaterParkNJ #PatientFirst

So if a hospital system can drop UHC and UHC Medicare Advantage, why do private practices struggle so much with doing the same?

Look what the CFO said:  "This has a huge negative community impact, a negative financial impact, and a negative patient care impact, **but at some point, UnitedHealth has to be held accountable**. We are trying to put our patients first," Katie Kucera, vice president and CFO at Carson Tahoe, told *Becker's.*

You've probably seen emails and posts regarding the ***UNCAGED CLINICIAN Launchpad*** program.

If so, we know that we've given a general overview of what the 10-week program entails.

Over the next few days we want to break it down for you even more to help you decide if Launchpad is right for you.

Week 1 is an introduction into leadership and business. We want to help you to establish the building blocks that create a solid foundation for your marketing. In other words, the little things that help to make marketing simpler.

Week 2 expands upon week 1 for creating a solid marketing foundation.

Here's the good news: you will hear more about marketing throughout the course. Why? Because a solid marketing strategy is a whole lot more than stopping by doctor's offices or running a Facebook ad.

Those things are side dishes. We want to give you the meat to marketing.

If you already know that our Launchpad is the right choice for you, sign up and get started today! (Link in Comments)

Have questions? Schedule a call with us. (Link in Comments)

Be a part of a community that is *Uncaging Clinicians & Revitalizing Healthcare!*

Just for fun I thought I'd ask ChatGPT to come up with a sales pitch and a marketing plan for cash services. These are the results I got:

"Invest in your health today and experience the benefits of physical therapy with cash payment. By paying with cash, you save time and money as there's no need to go through insurance claim processes. This means you can get started on your physical therapy journey right away without any delays. Moreover, cash payment gives you more control over your physical therapy sessions as you can choose the frequency and length of each session. So, why wait? Invest in your well-being and make the most of your physical therapy experience by paying with cash."

Marketing Plan for Cash-Pay Physical Therapy Services

Target Market: Our target market is individuals who are seeking physical therapy services and have the financial resources to pay out of pocket. This could include individuals who do not have insurance, have high deductibles or out of pocket maximums, or do not want to go through the hassle of insurance claim submissions and pre-authorizations.

Unique Selling Proposition: Our unique selling proposition is that by paying cash, clients will have access to more personalized and comprehensive physical therapy services without the restrictions and limitations imposed by insurance. This includes a personalized treatment plan, longer appointment times, and a more hands-on approach to treatment.

Marketing Channel: Our marketing channels will include social media platforms, email marketing, and direct mail. We will also reach out to local gyms and fitness studios to build partnerships and offer promotions for their members.

Social Media Marketing: We will utilize social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to reach our target market and showcase our physical therapy services. We will post informative articles and videos about physical therapy, share testimonials from satisfied clients, and offer promotions for cash-pay services.

Email Marketing: We will create an email marketing campaign to reach out to past and current clients who have expressed interest in our physical therapy services. The email will highlight the benefits of cash-pay services, including personalized treatment plans, longer appointment times, and a more hands-on approach to treatment.

Direct Mail: We will create a direct mail campaign that targets individuals who live in the area and have recently been diagnosed with a condition that would benefit from physical therapy. The direct mail will highlight the benefits of cash-pay services and offer a special promotion for new clients.

Partnership with Local Gyms and Fitness Studios: We will reach out to local gyms and fitness studios to build partnerships and offer promotions for their members. We will provide informational flyers and posters to be displayed in the gym or studio, and offer a discount on cash-pay services for members who sign up.

Promotion: We will offer a special promotion for new clients who choose cash-pay services. This could include a discount on their first appointment or a complimentary consultation.

Measuring Success: We will measure the success of our marketing plan by tracking the number of new cash-pay clients, the growth of our email marketing list, and the number of social media followers. We will also track the success of our partnerships with local gyms and fitness studios by tracking the number of members who take advantage of our promotions.

Adjustments: Based on the results of our marketing plan, we will make adjustments as needed to ensure the success of our cash-pay physical therapy services. This could include adjusting our marketing channels, refining our promotions, or expanding our partnerships with local gyms and fitness studios.

⚡ **UNCAGED HACK** ⚡

“Resentment is truly one of the best signals to potential long-term burnout.” – *Hannah DeGroot*

Resentment isn’t just frustration. It’s your body and mind signaling that something’s out of alignment—whether it’s crossed boundaries, unrealistic expectations, or carrying too much without support. 🚨

Instead of pushing it down, use resentment as a **warning system**:
✔ Pause and ask what’s fueling it
✔ Reset your boundaries before they crumble
✔ Take small steps to protect your energy
✔ Have honest conversations with your team or loved ones

Catch our latest podcast episode on how to recognize resentment for what it is, reset your nervous system during the day, and reclaim your joy in both work and life.

👉 Listen to the full episode: [links in comments below]

👥 Share this with a colleague or friend who might need this reminder.

Your success is our success. Let’s thrive UNCAGED together. 💪

Being a leader doesn't mean you stand on top of a mountain and yell down to those hiking and say "YOU CAN DO IT" 
Being a leader means leaving the mountain top to help those on the journey. Because ultimately leadership isn't about you. 
Which is why so few people really want to become better leaders. They want the benefits that often-time are accompanied by being in a leadership position but they don't want the messy-ness and challenges of actually leading. 
Our professions (PT, OT, SLP, Chiro, Massage, etc) and honestly the world needs more leaders. We have terrible examples all around us of "leaders" who are simply using their place of power for their own gain or are afraid to actually implement important and meaningful change. 
We need people to step up. 
Which is why I'm hosting the 6 week leadership intensive starting next Wednesday morning and want you to be a part of it. 
If you're ready to lead comment "READY" below and I'll reach out with more information.

I think this might help people understand the importance of a niche.   

My car (Nissan) was having issues so I decided to look for a mechanic.   During my search I found the following with good reviews: 

1. General mechanics who service all automobiles. 

2. Mechanics who specializes in servicing Nissans.  

Guess which mechanics I will be placing a call with? 

Happy Friday the 13th!

**AW RITE! AW RITE! AW RITE!**

It's FRIDAY! HECK YEAH!

Time to **KICK IT UP A NOTCH!** 🕺

*First and foremost, on behalf of the UNCAGED CLINICIAN team, I want to extend prayers out to all of those who are being or have been impacted by the hurricane.* 🙏

How about Lindsay Rush going out and crrrrushing her first RAGNAR race! YOU GO GIRL!! 

My dude, Howie Barrett, keeps growing his practice, *Get Set*.  He just added his second PT to the team! LET'S GOOO!

A couple of weeks ago we announced that Bill Johnson had added his first PT to his team at *Advantage Results Physical Therapy* (Harrisonburg, VA). Believe it or not, my man has kicked it up again by adding *another* PT to the team! BOOM SHAKALAKA!

Also growing her most amazing team at NeuroAxis Rehabilitation Services has been Kelsey Harris! She's added new peeps! DESTROYING IT!!!

First, Ashley Tunquist kicked up the relationship game by getting married a couple of weekends ago.  BUT THAT AIN'T ALL!! She has gone NEXT LEVEL by announcing that she and hubby Brandon are EXPECTING!! CONGRATS!!!

As parents, we should be the heroes and influencers in our kids' lives.  That is exactly what Kyle Womack and his wife are.  As the owners of *TheMuvCo* on Kauai, HI, they love movement and and training.  Their daughter, Linley just completed her first kids "showcase", doing what mom and dad love to do! FABULOUS!

One of the most important and valuable ways we can grow is through Education. Giving a big 'ol hand slap to Jocelyn Besa White!! Her application has been accepted for admission into the AAMT Fellowship for Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy! HUGE!!! CONGRATS!!

Last week we were stoked to announce that Christina Marie Ramirez and biz partner Camaron Chide Burney won BEST Physical Therapy in Galveston County (TX) in just their first year of operations.  Well, the honors didn't stop there. They earned the BEST award for League City, TX also!! BAMTASTIC for these recent UNCAGED CLINICIAN PATHWAY students!! (plug for the program? what plug?)

We pray for those in the path of Helene 🙏

Clinical Mentorship. 

We all want(ed) it when we first got started and let's be real... if you're on your own as a clinician in a practice you miss being able to bounce ideas off of others. 

Residencies have their place but the reality for most residents is they work way more hours and get paid less than their worth for the HOPE that they actually get mentorship that may or may not ever happen. 

Image having access to pick the clinical brains of some of the brightest minds in PT, OT, SLP, etc. 

That's another PART of what we're building at Uncaged Clinician and want you to be a part of.

It's hard to fix bad habits once you've created them but it's also hard to invest in coaching proactively so people try doing things on their own until they have a major problem. Just another reason that I'm so excited for the Uncaged Community and App launch party this Wednesday. We're changing the game so that people can have the tools and resources to do it right the first time without a large initial investment. We want to see healthcare providers equipped with the resources to not feel stuck in the grind. Join us this Wednesday to find out more!

I made a 10 minute video of stretches to do with one of my patients so she would have a short video to follow at home.  Follow it along and make these breathing and stretching exercises part of your morning. 
For you or the patients you treat.

Thought I’d share it because it can be a great little work out covering many muscles in the entire body. 
Some of the motions are good for nerve gliding, and overalll joint stretching.
Enjoy!

Someone asked recently:

"*How do I build a cash-based practice and not compromise patient care or violate any (rules)?*"  .... paraphrased somewhat

If you are wondering that yourself, you're in the right place.

At UNCAGED CLINICIAN, we go counter cultural to the standard norm.

With our LAUNCHPAD - PATHWAY combo, we help you to build your patient-focused practice while upholding the values that are important to you.

*We also show you how to crush it*.

Are you ready to go counter-culture?
