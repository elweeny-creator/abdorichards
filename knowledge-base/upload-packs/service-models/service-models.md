This is a random question, but is anyone hiring a remote person with PT background? 

Some of you may remember me as I asked for prayer after my 23 weeker twins were born in 2023. They are doing so well! 🙏I was eager to get my practice up and going this year and now I’m pregnant with twins again so that dream will be on hold for a while. 

From a financial and mental standpoint, I’d love to get back to practicing PT in some capacity while the babies are little, but I know I would probably need to be remote with part-time/prn hours. 

Any ideas or people hiring?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Have you looked into Remote Therapeutic monitoring? All of it is done at home! I know someone looking for therapist

Just wanted to share a little success. I started my mobile cash based practice as a side gig at the end of July. Still have a full time job in home health but squeeze in what I can, where I can, while keeping work life balance. In two months I’m now averaging around $800/week just on the side which is incredible. I was having trouble valuing myself in the beginning, but I had 3 new evaluations this week at $175 and have had really good positive feedback. Was told it was “worth every penny” just this morning. 
So just go for it. Provide good service and produce some results and you will be successful. The most positive feedback I have received is the value in educating your clients on what is going on, and what the recovery process looks like so they understand what they are getting into. Good luck to you all!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Congratulations 💕💕way to go!

> **Response 2:** I am a PT in Arkansas and do home health too. I’m not seeing cash based clients myself but would love to know your location and if I could refer anyone to you. Feel free to message me. Congrats!

Hoping this encourages someone!
I started my mobile cash business in March. Had a couple patients. Average 1-4 visits a week for the longest time. I was still doing full time home health. 

I resigned from full time HH on October 18th and started doing 5-10 prn visits for them a week and have been focusing on my business. 

This week, I have 12 visits with 1 client out of state who would have made this week 14. I have been consistently seeing 8-10 weekly for a month. 

I only need 15 a week @ $150 to replace my home health pay. (They cut my pay 20% in January)

I have paid for ads, done a couple spots on the news, and done a few other things for marketing that cost a little. 

Didn’t get much from that. 

I’ve been mostly focusing on building relationships with other business owners and local providers through podcast interviews, spending time with them when I can, going to business open house events, using a local business bartering service (Moxey). 

I know we are all different and in different locations, but be patient with yourself and  focus on a couple things with as big return as you can get. 

Be clear what you do for people and don’t sheepishly quote your price when people ask! Be confident! 

I haven’t made it yet and I don’t have it all together, but I’m moving in the right direction and SO CAN YOU! 

For context, there are at least 4 other therapists doing cash PT where I am in Shreveport, LA. Only about 180,000 people.  There’s plenty of business for us all! 

Most people are blue collar workers just like my dad was. People value being taken care of and I’m finding that out the more I push! 

Keep your head up and keep moving forward! 

Don’t waste time being busy, but be busy doing the things that work!

Forgot this originally. Even though I am still doing prn HH; the mindset shift if I’m now working on my business and doing part time for them vs part time in my business and HH as my main source WAS HUGE!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Jeremy Sutton Love watching your testimony unfold.  Keep up the great work and thank you for being a light

> **Response 2:** Nice work!! 🙌🏽 Are you charging for drive time or just writing it off? I’m doing this as well (combo of HH prn and cash mobile) but some of my mobile pts are more than a half hour drive away… it definitely cuts down on how many patients I can see if I’m doing those long drives.

So I have a dream of owning my own small ALF with a functioning farm as part of it, along with some hippotherapy treatments. 

I have no idea where to begin on getting loans, business grants, etc. Where does a person even start when setting out to own their own business? 

I don’t come from “much”, so I have no general life knowledge about this sort of thing. Having to research it all myself. Going to be a challenge but I’m ready to take it on. 💪🏽

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** This is such wonderful idea. I have always wanted to do something similar but with a pond for fishing, gardens, walk ways and a hippy vibe. Alternative medicines permitted. 😉

> **Response 2:** There in an alf that is exactly like this.  We see patients there for home health.  They have fresh eggs from chickens on the property every morning 😍

Hello! I am a mobile PT in central Wisconsin looking for advice from other mobile PTs on a vehicle they would recommend or don't recommend for the job?

Does anyone lease?

I currently have a 2017 Jeep Cherokee Limited with about 180k miles on it. Love it but have heard some issues with the newer ones.

My problem is my vehicle has been in the shop too many times with issues that it's now impacting business too often and costing me more money to have a rental since it takes weeks to get in and at least a week to fix. I'd like to fix this one as a back up but have a more reliable one.

Thank you!
Amanda

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** 163k miles on my 2008 Toyota 4Runner. I’ve owned it for 5 years now and turned in a 2013 Volkswagen Passat for it (absolute lemon of a car)

I’ll always be a Toyota fan! Never any problems and fixes are cheap and easy to handle. Most reliable cars and trucks on the market

> **Response 2:** My 2015 crv is at 300k and traded it to a new crv and gave it to my daughter. Then bought a little Honda civic 2017 at 160k running strong. Mileage is mileage. It's how you take care of it my friend. Good luck!!!

If ur a PT going into others homes, how do you ensure safety? Especially as a women?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Home care can be that way . I’ve had friends that have had their cars stolen, robbed multiple times while in patient homes. Those therapists all say do the worst neighborhoods in the am … drug addicts wake in afternoon looking for money or merchandise to steal.

> **Response 2:** I have worked for more than 20 years in home care, never felt unsafe inside a patient's home but I have used body guards to go with me in bad neighborhoods or bad buildings. I have one instance only when I got to the building door and did not trust people outside so I did not do the visit

If you are a mobile PT who brings a portable table with you and it fits in the trunk of your vehicle, what kind of vehicle do you drive?  After a year of making it work, I need a vehicle that can fit my table in the trunk so I don’t have to put it in the back seat where my kids sit!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Toyota RAV4 Hybrid
Which I bought almost a year ago and LOVE the gas mileage and that I fill up every 2-3 weeks).  But for your concerns, before my RAV4, I had a Subaru Outback and my table easily fit in there as well.

> **Response 2:** VW Atlas. The table fits perfectly & can still fit in a double jogging stroller in 3rd row with 2 kids in carseats in the 2nd row.

I’m seriously considering leaving the hospital setting and starting my own practice by myself. I’m hesitant to do it because of all the energy and time starting a new company takes with small kids at home. I feel I don’t have much more time or energy to give to something else but I want a change in schedule and more flexibility. I’m a person that needs to know numbers. How do I find out what the private practice- self employed (1 clinician) makes in a year and how many hours they work?  And have this related to my geographic location? I need a comparison locally. Also need to look at other benefits- what does insurance cost and where would you go through for medical benefits as I would loose good medica benefits, PTO, retirement matching, etc.
Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am currently starting my own mobile outpatient practice. Been working on it since about May of this year, and just launched my website last weekend looking to start taking patients in January. My kids are 3, 5, and 6. I did the uncaged boot camp classes in the evenings, and I took a course to become certified in my specialty by waking up at 5am to do the coursework while everyone else slept. I developed my own website in the evenings or on weekends until it was ready to launch, and now I don’t have to mess with it. My sister also started her own mobile outpatient practice with four kids at home. It’s definitely do-able, but you have to look at how you’re spending your time and give yourself grace to develop it slowly if it’s really what’s best for your family life. In the meantime, I still work full time in home health. If you went just PRN with a HH agency, you would probably have better pay and more flexibility. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** When my kids were little I really enjoyed working PRN,  because when I was working I could focus on work but when I came home I was present for them. 

Now that they are a bit older I recently started my own mobile PT practice. Not gonna lie, I feel like it was a lot of work to get everything in place. But I'm a bit OCD lol...This might just be me but when my kids were little I would not have wanted that responsibility. The other thing is I don't need the benefits as my husband's are good.

Pay in my area...outpt PRN 40ish per hour, Home Health PRN 55-60 per visit plus wear and tear on your car. A lot more paperwork especially if you have to do start of cares, I find they are not worth it being PRN.

If you can find somewhere that does mobile outpatient PT in the home much easier on paperwork. 55 a visit in my area. The best way to do this is to sign on with a few companies and keep your area very  very small. Drive time is everything. 

For reference with Medicare and the supplement I get about 105 a visit, with my mobile PT practice and I am doing my own billing and pay for my own equipment car,  gas, all that. But look at the pay difference...I feel like it's worth doing it on my own. 105 vs 55...no brainer.
Another good option if you're not ready to take the leap is look into Luna in my area they pay about 70 a visit mobile outpatient PT in the home. I know people give them a lot of shade but I love working for them too. I'm an independent contractor with them so they help fill in my schedule a bit. Plus guaranteed pay on the spot
Super easy paperwork and you can just focus on treating.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have more questions

Any ideas for “parallel bars” for mobile PT

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I love the answers above about walkers. Especially four wheeled walkers. But I also love kitchen sinks, counters and stair railings. 

Can’t always be accomplished, but there is a certain elegance to finding solutions, inherent in peoples homes/living environments.￼

**Community Responses:**

Hey y’all. This is a question for everyone who has started their own mobile practice.

What was the main reason you started it?

Looking back at that reason specifically, has it lived up to your expectations?

Also, looking at it now, what are YOUR biggest pros and cons of starting your own mobile practice?

Thank you in advance for your responses.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Less overhead, getting out of my W2 job, being able to provide exceptional care without having insurance dictating what we could do (cash pay practice). Better income potential than W2. And yes would never go back

Pros: flexible schedule, not paying rent for a clinic, pts love the concierge level experience vs what they get with HH

Cons: driving to other pts but isn't that big of a deal

> **Response 2:** Pro: flexibility, time to research best/updated practices, spending time with patients rather than documenting for the insurance companies, I found a new passion for business operations. 

Con: time that goes into start up, marketing takes $, balancing a job with benefits and slowly decreasing that caseload so I can slowly increase my private pay caseload.

How do you create breaks in your day?

When I was in my mobile practice, I got my breaks driving from client to client. 

Doing so gave me the opportunity to “get outside”.

Now that I spend my days mostly on zooms, I find that I have to be intentional about grabbing a mental refresher. 

No matter the weather, I love to get out in the sun if but a few minutes.

Yes, even in the summer when it’s 115 degrees. 

I’d love to hear what your favorite thing to do is as a “break” in your day.

I’d love to say I’m just nosy but I’m really just curious. What are your clinic’s (or clinics’) average units billed per session?? Mine from 2022 Mobile 3.44 brick and mortar 3.42

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Right at 4 mobile. 3.9 I think. 

Some 5 unit visits (evals, longer tx times for higher level pts) get offset by 1-2 unit visits when tolerance is low, pt having an off day, etc when tx cut short.

> **Response 2:** I’m pretty consistently billing 4 units for standard treatment. I cant justify driving out to a clients home to do 3 units. I do 55/60 min treatments because i can only do time math by 5 mins LOL obviously it will vary. sometimes it’s 3 units, really really rarely is it 2 units and at that point I’m telling the pt to cancel if they can’t do a full session of therapy (24+ hour notice). I have some maintenance Geris but mostly younger athletic groups though.

First take of my social media intro video and photos of my new location:

Please if you are willing to watch the video give me some feedback. Also if you have anything positive or helpful criticism to say about the photos that’s great too.

Update: Thanks for all the feedback everyone. I’m going to get some branded shirts made and make a series of videos instead like some people have suggested. My goal will be to limit the main intro video to 5 min or less and each follow-up side video to 2.5 min or less.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would be a little more upbeat during the video, especially at the very beginning—you want to exude excitement right off the bat and get people interested. Nice place! Looks great. A few other suggestions: make the video more concise/short 11 mins is long for a potential patient to watch all the way through, wear something branded to showcase your business. Good luck!

> **Response 2:** Thank you for your service! 🇺🇸I love your mindset on exercise, inclusivity🏳️‍🌈, reaching goals of your clients! The clinic looks great! Shorter video, have a couple 1 min videos to highlight treatment areas and large gym. Hire a professional to film. Need a mic for better audio and filming needs editing. Fill the gym up with clients, friends working out, need music too. Will you have other staff? Add special effects/text in video to drive home key points, visual impact. You want to invoke emotion for action, I think most people only have attention of 1 min to get your message then they swipe. You are very brave to put yourself out there for feedback. Good luck!! 👊🏾👊🏼👊🏿

I have a question I hope someone can answer for me. My parents recently moved to Florida from North Carolina. My mom was in the hospital & was discharged home. She will be getting home health PT & skilled nursing (Med A). She needs therapy badly. They will then be traveling back to NC in 2 weeks for 10 days. I don’t want her to go 10 days without PT-she can’t afford to lose any more function. I’d like her to get PT through my Med B mobile business. Can her MD in Florida write her a script for PT & I would be able to provide her with therapy while she was here?  I live in NC & am licensed here as well as the other therapists that work for me. I realize the home health company in Florida would have to discharge her from her home health episode of care before she would be eligible to receive PT through Med B. But is a script from her Florida doctor sufficient? Or does it have to come from a NC doctor?  Thank you for any insight!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Out of state referrals are fine but you or your company cannot treat your parents and bill Medicare.

> **Response 2:** You can treat your mom for free and not bill any insurance. Why go through all that?

Mobile PTs- what do you do to keep your equipment organized and not run in/out of your car a million times every session? 

I’ve got adjustable dumbbells, physioball, therabands, TRX, massage table.

Just scheduled my first cash-only mobile client this week!!! Any advice on flow, organization, documentation, etc is welcome!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I use two car organizers and bags...I just place what I need for that patient in a bag. If I really need something mod session I will run to go get it. Also, I try to ask patients what they already have in their home and use what they have more than anything. This also helps with HEP carryover when they know exactly how to do it with their stuff.

Thinking about a mobile PT niche to provide more flexibility for my family. Anyone out there a mobile PT? If so, what are advantages and disadvantages? Private pay ? Thanks for any info.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’ve been doing it for about 6 months and love it! I treat a lot of pregnancy and postpartum folks so it’s super convenient for them. I also love having the break of drive time in between patients, especially as an introvert, to recharge. I treat out of my home for some folks too and that has worked out really well! 

Cons: like others said, drive time, but I limit my driving to 20 min radius. Also limited in how much equipment you can use

> **Response 2:** Possibly dumb question but do you accept pts in only certain areas? Thinking of safety nowadays 🥹

I have a patient with orders to start outpatient services S/P Reverse TSA. He is already seeing a nurse from Home Health for the same. Home Heath PT evaluated and DC’d after saying he needs Outpatient. Can I see him for O/P PT when he is already receiving services from Home Health?As per my understanding one can not seek outpatient services when receiving Home Health, due to billing concerns. Is that true or false as he is not receiving PT from Home Health? 

Please advise.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Always ask about home health on your discovery call before setting up the appointments. Patients think since it’s different disciplines they don’t understand 2 different payment models can’t be covered simultaneously

> **Response 2:** Has to be an AGENCY discharge from home health to bill part B services, not just PT discharge. Home health part A services is paying the agency to provide all nursing and therapy needs. Whether or not they’re actually providing the therapy services or just nursing, a part B therapy claim will still get rejected - or paid now and you’ll get a recoupment letter later.

Hello!

Curious as to everyone who is NOT uncaged (still working as a staff PT), what is your comfort level with taking patients who your clinic has discharged (totally done with them) and offering them wellness services/coaching/performance services, privately (not associated with your clinic)?

If not comfortable, why?

Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m in home health, even if we dc our patients I would not feel ok taking them on as part b or wellness because as a home care patient they still have the option to private pay if their insurance does not cover continued services. It’s tricky, I would love to be able to follow my joint replacement patients with outpatient rehab, but even then I’d be self referring with PHI from the company’s EMR.

> **Response 2:** I think it depends, does your clinic offer these services? I’m in home health so they don’t offer any type of wellness, so I’m 100% comfortable offering it to people, and I have let all my agencies know I do part B PT and wellness.

Scenario- your mobile neuro cash/Medicare practice has been steadily growing for 3 years. You've vaguely contemplated opening a clinic in the distant, far off, aways away future. 
Suddenly the ONLY outpatient neuro clinic in the south half of your town (which happens to be the third largest city in your state) is abruptly closing. 
Now all you can think about is what color to paint the walls, office locations, how many hi-low tables you need, structured mentoring programs, and what songs to put on the clinic playlist.
What would you do? 
Also, you hate waking up early...
OK, go.

PSA. This text message was a follow-up to a phone conversation. I had with an owner of a fairly large home health agency in Chicago. She explained she just got out of some big meeting where they discussed. The home health payment cuts for 2024. If there was ever a time to break away. If there was ever a time to start your own gig. The time is now. The best time was yesterday and the next best time is now.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Fill us in when she texts you the numbers.

> **Response 2:** I don't think the proposed rule for home health has been released yet, so I will be curious to see what number she gives you.  Over the past few years they've actually received increases, small amounts but still an increase.

**A big THANK YOU to everyone who posted their take, this was really helpful to navigate this situation. I am unable to respond to each one, but it was great to see the different perspectives. They helped me build a plan of action for how to proceed with my potential patients. Thanks again!!

Advice please: I run a small mobile private pay PT business and I’m still trying to build my caseload. There’s a potential patient who is asking for me to come meet him and his wife (also potential patient) at their home, ~30 min drive away.
This couple owns several restaurants in my city and are fairly well-off. This could be a good boost for my company, both as income and referral sources.
What I’m trying to decide is if I should go drive out to meet this couple (something I never do for free for other patients) or should I ask for a zoom meeting, instead?
I really want and need the business, but I don’t want my *desperation* to cloud my judgement. 
What makes the most sense to do?

Thanks, in advance!

Edit to clarify: I only mentioned 30 minute drive to highlight it’s not an easy drop-in for a free consultation. The drive to see this patient is not the issue, as it’s built into the session price.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Last year I drove 15.5 hours for FREE to see a patient at a large company just for the opportunity to gain their business. One year later, I might be looking at a whole region of locations because of this feat. Could it have been a $600 loss? Sure. 

BUT, I would rather spend that money with a direct face to face marketing opportunity then spending $100 on indirect marketing that likely won't work. These face to face opportunities are worth their weight in gold!

Go the extra mile, be THAT therapist. In a world of people kinda going for it, just go for it. Hold nothing back. ♥️

> **Response 2:** If you are building your business and you have the time, that is all it will cost you. The benefits sound like they far at weigh your time used. If you are great at what you do, you will not only gain 2 paying clients, but also a terrific future referral stream that could be HUGE for your business. I would highly recommend taking the time and going for that consult. People talking about it being offered as “free” need to understand that free consults should be priced into your visit costs and focus on having a high conversion rate. That is a great model for a successful business! Don’t get deterred by the drive or the “free” part, or anything else. Focus on giving a high quality service and letting that lead to future business growth! Big picture! Goodluck!

Before I look it up… I have a request by a daughter of a potential mobile PT patient if I can do her weekly fasting glucose during my visit. I’m not asking if I can BILL for it. Just asking about the act of doing it. Illinois here.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Pretty sure no. 

I remember learning to do the glucose tests (super easy) in school and then they were like oh btw don’t do this with patients lol.

> **Response 2:** Isn’t the weekly fasting glucose usually a blood draw for labs?  I’ve never seen a fasting glucose reading from a finger prick.  I have seen PTs do glucose monitoring before, but fasting glucose reading she would probably have to have a nurse or go to a lab.

What is the logistics of starting a Home Health Company?  We are an outpatient neuro clinic and was wondering how feasible is it to start a home health company that is neuro specific? 😝

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** We have 7 outpatient physical therapy clinics. We opened a home health agency 14 years ago too. 

We are independent in both and have so many experienced clinicians.  I am the director of therapy for the outpatient and Administrator for the home health company.  

It’s a lot harder to open the home health company.  You have to so much money in an account to show and basically treat the first 10 Medicare patients for free (it was 14 years ago). A lot more regulations for licensing.  Must have a Director of Nursing and the policies and procedures are totally different.  I been through 4 state surveys for both.  Nothing is the same except the emergency preparedness plan we have to maintain for both. We have two 
separate companies and two separate EMRS and billing.  

I feel home health is not patient generated and driven only by discharge planners.  I’m not sure how much a specialist would do as visits could be limited.  People generally do not have freedom of choice.  The hospitals dictate agencies then if they go to a SNF, they tend to dictate who is picked.  

I personally feel the best way to be a specialist and be sought out is only through outpatient at home.  Not home health. If you want to get into home health , contract with a home health agency first.  

We have so many outpatient therapists that specialize that also do home health, and it does not generate additional business in home health. We are a top provider in outpatient in our area but it never has helped us in home health.

My wife worked in home health for years  and was a Parkinson’s specialist.  She left her home health company (different than the one I’m in charge of and it was owned by a hospital) and started a separate outpatient at home business.  She does so much more business as an outpatient provider using her specialty.  

So, basically I have seen outpatient, outpatient at home, and home health through 3 different companies.

Winning formula = contract yourself out to home health agency, see patients for the plan of care. Once the agency discharges, go in as outpatient provider with through indoor self pay. Agencies are limiting home-health visits and patients have such a need after discharge.

> **Response 2:** I don't think neuro patients would be as profitable because they will require a lot more intensity of care, more visits and likely more disciplines involved. Majority of the time our neuro patients were getting PT, OT, ST, MSW, nursing, and HHA.

For those of you who went from mobile ➡️ brick and mortar 🏣do you have any regrets?  Why did you make the switch?  Any other words of advice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Approx 90% of my practice is still mobile but I have a brick and mortar space that I rent from a prosthetist colleague. Like others said, it fulfilled a mission to collaborate on patients with limb loss and offer a space for older adults. The caseload hasn't grown in the brick and mortar ad I had hoped but I smile every time I put my key in the door and see my logo on the wall so I'm gonna keep it going for a while and see if I can make it work!

> **Response 2:** I still provide mobile visits but also wanted to have a brick n mortar space to fully live out the vision I have.   I think it’s important to really think out what you want to do with your business and if having a clinic space helps move you toward that goal.  For me I envisioned having a space that I could host workshops and education seminars to help the community and I wanted to be able to offer other services that can’t be provided in a mobile setting.

I also think it’s important not to rush into a space, make sure it’s the best fit for you before taking the leap.

Hi.  What is the difference between Mobile PT and home health?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** A lot less documentation

> **Response 2:** Home Health is billed under Medicare part A, physicians have to sign orders and patients have to be home bound , usually only lasting a couple of weeks, falls under PDGM, must have qualifying verbage in clinical notes for medical necessity.  Mobile PT is OP PT in home, billed under Medicare PArt B, only needs a script, pt does not need to be home bound, treatments are closer to an hr and duration can be longer than HH.

Currently sitting in my "morning office" before I migrate up to my "productive office" (dress code is knit booties)

Hanging out in this group over the last few months, I've noticed a big trend:

A lot of you spend tons of **time, energy and money on patient acquisition** on the front end and then basically do next to nothing for them when they are done with care.

Sure there are some folks to "never discharge", but how can we turn an industry inside joke into a way to make **more money, in less time?**

Can a mobile provider offer multiple services (OT, PT,ST) without being considered a home health agency? 

I’ve been a mobile provider providing services in TX for over 2 years now taking both commercial and medicaid insurance. I am wanting to expand but I do not want to go down the route of being classified as a home health agency. Does anyway have any advice or laws about this specific to Texas. 

I appreciate any input!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes. Why not. We provide all 3 services both for mobile and our clinics. Good luck!!!!

Instead of mobile outpatient PT can we be a home health business owner/PT? Reimbursement is higher this way…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** The reimbursement is higher but the start up and operations cost id also exponentially higher. And a ton of regulations by the state and conditions of participation by CMS.

> **Response 2:** Having done both and having my own solo practice but never having any experience managing home health I would think that there are a lot more home health guidelines that need to be followed as well as having to supply or contract with all of the disciplines. You also need to think about the area you want to cover. 
I know the reimbursement is higher it probably also requires a lot more manpower to run

Anybody buy a new car under their business? I'm thinking of trading in my car and upgrading - wondering what the benefits / cons are of paying for the new car under my business

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Dustin Howard bought himself a SUHWEET ride through his biz

> **Response 2:** I believe that the full tax credit only applies to new vehicles. (Not sure if it’s still over a certain gross vehicle weight anymore?)

Here is a thought in case you wanted a “less expensive than brand new” option:
If you buy a diesel or a hybrid, the mileage rate more than offsets the costs of the car.

That also lets you dip your toe into something really fun or quirky like a German diesel or a more torquey hybrid.

I currently have a mobile practice in Texas and have decided to credential with BCBS TX. When I try to fill out the credentialing application via Availity, I am asked about accreditation or when I expect accreditation to be completed. I know what accreditation is, but I'm mobile so I'm not sure how to proceed there. That next issue I have is the facility location, being mobile I assume that I put my home address. Has anyone had issues with BCBS TX with using their home address as the facility location? Any guidance is appreciated. TIA.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following… also in TX and starting up mobile practice. Not positive on BCBS…

> **Response 2:** I’m a mobile practice based in Fort Worth and I got credentialed with bcbs with no issues. However, I used an agency. It could have been done without their help either (I realized it afterwards) 
Gave home address as the business, and have treated couple of patients already. Patient’s home is the place of service.

I currently work in SNF. Corporate is reporting that the building is losing money on Medicare Part B (with Medicaid secondary) and Managed Part B due to the 20% write offs and reimbursement cuts by insurance. Is anyone currently uncaged and doing a mobile practice with this population? I would like to open a mobile practice with this population one day, but am concerned about the viability. Thoughts?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Yes, but typically SNFs won't allow you to see anyone in the facility. You could definitely work with them at home!

> **Response 2:** Just curious is the SNF that you work at￼ a contract therapy company ?

Anyone in North NJ on here? Specifically Morris, Passaic, Warren or Essex County? I'm mobile med B up in Sussex County and parts of Morris, but I've been getting more calls recently from patients in these other counties, would love to be able to throw business to other clinicians if possible.

**Community Responses:**

Has anyone purchased a really cool converted vehicle like school bus or RV for their mobile practice?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I’m dying to do it. For years I’ve wanted to get a C Class RV and convert it, and then just park by the big aerospace companies in my area so their employees can come out and not waste drive time to get work done.

> **Response 2:** There was an OT in Canada who converted a bus into a sensory gym. She did therapy and also rented it to moms groups, birthday parties, etc. 

I think she’s doing other stuff now, but her bus was awesome! 

Side note:
Make sure you have an electrician do the wiring… there have been a lot of bus fires in campgrounds from the DIYers.

**Community Responses:**

I bring a travel coffee cup with me so I only brew the coffee in the room and don't buy Starbucks all week (saves me tons of time as well because the lines are LONG!). You will get free registration for the day that you present as a speaker so I always encourage people to submit proposals for future CSM (home health academy is always looking for new content if you are mobile).

Our home health company is laying off half of its PTs come July. I’ve always liked the idea of owning my own business but being in home health have lost my ortho skill set and really don’t know how I could turn this into replacing my income anytime soon. Does anybody have any pearls of wisdom? Other positions in the area do not seem to pay as well or aren’t desirable to me.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I had been in the home health setting for nearly 8 years when I decided to start my own biz so I understand and had the same doubts of loosing some of my ortho skills but it comes back once you get into it! I’ve also taken several continuing Ed classes in all the areas that I found most interesting which has been so amazing!  I also did home health PRN until my own caseload was large enough to go all in on my business.   You can do so do it if it’s what you want! Jump on a call with the uncaged team! I went through their 5 month program in the beginning and it really helped me to over come some of the doubts I had and gave me a framework to build from.

Has anyone had success getting referrals from social workers who work in rehabs? Thought this would be a great idea. I’ve had good back and forth convos via e mail, met with some in person, brought pizza, but haven’t gotten much from them and it’s been 3 weeks. They make it seem like there’s such demand, but I’m sitting here like hello? Remmeber i said i can see your people ASAP?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It might be that the medical reason and need for multiple disciplines that qualified them for inpatient rehab means needing a nurse and OT and/or SLP post discharge and HH can do all of that. People also like that HH is paid at 100% by Medicare and they might not have a supplement to cover the Med B 20% so patients “pick” HH. I see that all the time in ALFs. The patient could easily be seen by Med B but HH is coming in instead.

> **Response 2:** Generally speaking most (not all) clients when they leave rehabs will qualify as homebound which under Medicare is paid 100% for a home health agency/ provider so most will go that route because there is no copay. Once they are no longer homebound they do not qualify for HH. Also transportation is NOT a qualifier under Medicare to make you homebound. You may have “no way” to get transportation but are physically able to leave the home, Medicare will not pay for home health that way. So I would for sure try to contact home health companies for referrals after HH. some advantage plans are getting super stingey and despite being homebound and needing more therapy won’t authorize anymore. Our home health company opened a part B at home service line to account for these issues, you potentially could be the solution to a HH companies clients who are out of payment through HH

I'm a solo, cash-pay/OON, mobile PT and primarily treat ortho. I have a very unique situation and took on an acute post-CVA. She needs OT and and SLP services, in home. I'm having trouble finding any that are cash-pay and will come to her home.

Can I hire an OT and SLP as an independent contactor? Can I do this quickly, or is this a big, lengthy process? How do I go about doing this?

I do not plan on adding these services to my business permanently, nor do I need this to be a money maker for me.  I just need to find someone for this one patient.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would connect her with a skilled home health agency that offers PT/OT/Speech. My 2 cents is that if she has Medicare, these are covered services and she sounds like she is homebound.

> **Response 2:** Does this patient have any caregiver support? Could they aid in a session delivered via telehealth for OT/SLP if you cannot find anyone in the area but could find a provider in state.

Wanted to get everybody’s feedback. ￼ I work for a home health agency that contracts home physical therapy visits to a local hospice. ￼ Usually ￼we only get four visits at most.￼ Our focus is home safety and fall prevention and a home exercise program. My home health company is sending me back to see ￼ a hospice patient that I just discharged, ￼ even though the hospice previously did not authorize any further visits. There is no skilled PT indicated as caregivers are already providing range of motion and the patient is bedbound. ￼ the home care company is asking me to do a full-blown Medicare Oasis assessment  even though the services are  through hospice and only 4 visits. ￼ The home health company is telling me it’s OK to see this patient even though I am not providing a skilled service. May be legal but is this ethical?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Sometimes the role in hospice is to provide services as the person declines. In the case of PT, perhaps positioning, cushion recommendations, etc. Hospice is a much different, more limited approach. What is the reason? Is family requesting assistance with something? Is there an increase in pain? If there is a new need, then an OASIS would be needed to establish POC if nursing has discharged? But, that seems unlikely. Assuming nursing is still seeing, wouldn't PT eval suffice? I am confused on these details. Is there a wound?

> **Response 2:** There was a change in federal law that went into effect Dec1 that all patients have an oasis regardless of payor. Often in situations like that, there are new caregivers or a complete change in caregiver and they require new education which is skilled.

Looking at reaching out to local assisted living facilities for mobile PT, but looking for feedback from those who already do this. 

1. I've heard from many that most of the advantage plans don't allow for mobile visits. Have you found this to be true? And if so, how do you go about explaining that to prospective patients/facility managers?

2. How did you go about contacting the facilities and marketing to patients?

3. Any other feedback/ advice/comments to offer

Thanks everyone!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hi Brooke Terilli. This is primarily what I do in my mobile practice. I’d be happy to talk with you about it :)

> **Response 2:** When I was working home healthcare in ALFs, I always wanted to know who the best mobile providers were so we could do a hand-off. 

Do you have relationships with the home health agencies? 

Their biggest concern is usually that they’ll get the patient back after the next hospitalization or adverse event. So I’d be sure to let them know your plans to refer back to them when the status changes and the client qualifies for home health again. 

Just my take from the HH side. It was all about trust and if we’d “get them back” or if the outpatient person would try to hold them on their caseload even after a fall/hospitalization/adverse event. 😊

🔥🔥🔥Perspective🔥🔥🔥 so yesterday my back driver side (gas tank on passenger side) of my car was smashed while parked on the street. It’s prob totaled (it’s old w a lot of miles) but still drivable. So we were able to go out of town for the weekend as planned without a rental. I told me girls we were so lucky we were still able to leave without a hitch. One of my girls said “mom… did you forget the bad part where your car is smashed and you need to get a new one?” 🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠 well… no. That’s just life 🫠🫠

I can't believe I have a new car but sadly I totaled my 08 coming back from an ice age trail trip last year on poorly marked rural roads 🙁 cars are the new luxury item. if you can order new, it'll save you over buying cert pre-owned which I had to bc I was in a crunch and it was months to wait for a new car. You can also buy back totaled cars if the damage isn't too horrible or involving airbags ( I blew front and side, ouch that hurt but it saved my life against  1 ton work truck) .I hope you can keep yours running but by gosh, if you can't try to order a new one and not buy used...the used are more expensive

Hi fellow uncagers, I’m looking for a company in South Florida (they can be located elswehere/national) who I can see my patients through for in home outpatient therapy. I don’t yet have the ability to bill insurances and all that fun stuff myself yet. I’m having a hard time finding a company (besides Luna) who can handle the admin side of our job while letting me see someone through their whole POC. So far everyone just wants me to do SUP visits while a PTA treats. I’ve already amassed a decent amount of patients over the last couple years, but due to recent changes I just need a new company to contract for to see my people. Any leads would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I'm in Vero Beach , FL feel free to reach out

> **Response 2:** I'm in Central Florida and there is also a company called LifeCare Home therapy which does that. I thought they also had a branch in South Florida, perhaps near West Palm? Give them a quick search online. They do mobile part b and they do contract with a few home care companies but I think that's a lot less now

Anyone else struggling to get their business verified with google? I have watched several videos, followed directions with street address, my house number( I am mobile and treat out of my home), showed my IRS forms and the room I treat and still no luck. (and under two minutes). Any suggestions  out there or success stories? Thanks

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you are mobile then choose service area ( if you have not done that)  and not a particular address , that’s when it will ask for a video verification. I did the mistake of first entering my address  & had to submit multiple videos. Then after I entered as service area business , it got verified in a day .. hope this helps

> **Response 2:** It's best to chat with support and they can help. They usually submit a ticket and it's fixed in about a week in most cases.

To those of you mobile PT/OT/SLP.. Looking for advice/proper auto coverage options (I am in NJ). 
Looking to insure a (personal) new vehicle that will be used for business (to/from each patient and carrying equipment).  My current carrier stated not covered under personal policy now that I disclosed that info- I am told I need a commercial policy.  To get a commercial policy vehicle needs to registered under business w commercial plates.  
Please advise thank you!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following this is a great question.  New private practice mobile pediatric OT here!

> **Response 2:** Why do you want coverage? I'd say you're just driving to work. You're not transporting clients. I recently changed my auto policy and my insurance broker changed my auto insurance and it says purpose pleasure and business/artisan. It actually saves me money compared to my old perspn Geico policy. 

Also I was in a car accident on my way to a client. When the police and insurance ask where you're going..I say I'm driving to work in a private home. They don't ask more questions. 

Now...for my employees driving their cars. I have coverage for them in my general liability.

I'm providing PT services in my home-treatment space as well as in-home visits. The only insurance I take is BC/BS and I do my own billing for this (for now).  Which code is appropriate for my mobile visits? Code 15 for mobile treatment or Code 12 for home visit? These are not folks who are unable to get out for a clinic visit, but prefer in-home. Also, any special authorizations or modifiers I need to use Code 15? I appreciate input from this group.

Starting travel physical therapy for the first time at the end of this month, and my first assignment I chose to do Home Health. Any advice/resources I can look at? I was an OP ortho PT the past 6.5 years. I have never done home health. Anything you’d like to share I’d so appreciate! My e-mail is Veramichellep@gmail.com

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It's basically the same my friend..instead of the patient going to you. You go to your patients home. Good luck! You got this!

> **Response 2:** I'm currently considering doing travel PT.  I have done home health, great way to see the new area on a daily basis.  Good one on one time with patients.  Excess documentation may be the only downfall depending on the agency, but you just have to get a good system down for it.  Enjoy!

This question is for a family member of mine. She is receiving PT through a mobile Medicare B provider. Family wants to have a nurse from local hospital home care agency come in to do an assessment. Her memory is not good amd she does not live alone but other person does not really want to be a care giver. They are hoping they could get a home health aide in as well as an OT. For some ADL/ cognitive work. I was told after speaking to the home care agency she can’t have the PT in while she is receiving services for Medicare part A. As Medicare will only cover one or the other. She is home bound as can’t drive. The part B provider thinks this only applies to days he would be in apartment. So on days he’s not in Medicare part A providers can come in amd bill. Does anyone know rules on this. Is it one vs the other or can it be mixed. She likes the PT already coming into home amd has been getting it for a few months from them. This is mainly about getting a home health aide to be covered for a period of time by Medicare and that has to go through a certified agency.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** She can not have Med Part B PT and Med Part A PT at the same time.  Meaning, only 1 plan of care can be carried out at once.  She will have to choose either staying with the Part B OR switching to home health to use Part A.

> **Response 2:** Once admitted to home health, the med B PT is giving visits for free until discharged completely from home health agency. Home health service has a certification period usually lasting 60 days but can be shorter or longer depending on patient needs. Med A pays for the period, not per visit.

Also, what’s a good cash rate for mobile PT?

In GEORGIA, btw.

Good luck!

I am seeing a private patient (cash) at their vacation home where I need to take a ferry. Travel is $27 and 2 hour round trip plus 1 hr treatment. They’re paying me $250. I cover travel. 

They are going back to their house in Manhattan at the end of summer. My patient and I have a great connection (he has severe dementia) and his wife asked if I would considering seeing him once/month in Manhattan. 4 hour round trip and about $75 travel costs. Plus one hour of treatment. she told me to think about it and about payment. Im not sure where to start or what to ask for. Advice/suggestions?

I’m thinking if it’s worth my while to ask for every other week. And amount???

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you able to get other patients in that area? Even one more patient might make it worth the travel. Otherwise, that one appointment is about 5 hours out of your day.

Looking for best recommendations for mobile hotspot/wifi? I have a mobile practice with 3 clinicians, so looking to get them to be able to do point of service documentation.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am mobile and actually just ask the patient to connect to their wi-fi on the first visit.  It takes a minute, but then it auto connects each time I go back.  If for some reason I can’t use their wi-fi (occasionally they can’t find their password), I use my phone as a hotspot.  It was just very unreliable for me when I was trying to use it consistently.  Patients are usually happy to let me connect.

> **Response 2:** I use Verizon mifi for our practice

Hi group!!! After basically 2 years of stalking this page, I am in the process of finally starting my own mobile PT practice. Any recommendations on lightweight portable treatment tables?? Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Following. I just purchased one on Amazon, but it’s about 33-34lbs, and I’m concerned about lugging it in/out of people’s homes. I’m wondering if I for sure need one and am curious how many are doing fine without it. I will be doing vestibular therapy, so wanted a 30 inch width, and the lightweight ones that wide are too expensive.

Hey y'all. I am exploring options to take my 100% mobile practice to partially at a physical location. Those who have done this- Did you change your price per session when you switched from mobile to physical location? Thanks!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't think changing locations necessitates a change in cost. Your time is still your time.

> **Response 2:** When I went to brick and mortar from mobile, I was planning to differentiate my costs, but didn't end up doing much mobile since people just came to me now. It worked out 🙂 

I do sometimes do in home/onsite/at hotel or temp residence for people that are coming through my city with performance groups/filming.  For that situation, if  i'm traveling outside of a 5 mile radius from my home or office, I add a $15 travel fee to my standard hourly. If they are staying near where I work or live, or filing at the studio 3 miles from my house, I don't charge that fee. 

So short answer, my treatment time fee is the same if they come to me or I go to them, but I do consider my time traveling to someone in my billing and will charge the travel fee as needed.  I'm completely cash based if that matter.

Hey 👋 all you mobile therapists!!! I had an idea come to me and I wanted to sound it off here… 

what about a mobile PT monthly subscription box filled with equipment that can be used with your patients (theraband, other small portable exercise equipment, massage creams, etc). 

Is this something that already exists? 

I’m not interested in creating because I already have too much on my plate 😩 but thought I’d leave the idea here for anyone else who might find it interesting!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Love the thinking!

> **Response 2:** My first reaction to this as a potential buyer is "not worth it." Because I get plenty of use out of stuff I bought a year ago, with no need to replenish. 🤷

But now I'm thinking, maybe if swag is included? T-shirts, to go mugs, stickers...

Or even lifestyle stuff, since I basically live in my car on workdays. Air fresheners, miniature hand sanitizer bottles, car-friendly packaged snacks...

Free trials or vouchers for grocery pickup...

Pens, notepads, etc...

And now I'm thinking.... You know.... I might just be tempted to subscribe to something like that. 🤣

Hello, edited to clarify for private pay as a concierge PT not using any insurance 

I’ve gotten a few requests lately to work with people while they are in a rehab facility or skilled nursing. They find their care (or their parents care) is insufficient and are asking me to come see them bedside for extra supplemental physical therapy. Any suggestions how to not “rock the boat“ with the facility.  Does hospital or nursing home have different rules for outside PT? 
I know the bigger picture overall is lack of funding, but patients are still sick and would benefit from additional intervention 
Thanks !￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think you have to make sure facility is okay with it.  Once they are home you should be good to go.

> **Response 2:** Worked in nursing home for last 12 years ,
Nursing home rehab reimbursement is through Med A Or Med B for long term care  patients .
You can get paid only private pay from the family for supplemental rehab…

Nursing home or ALF will not pay you …
Sorry but that’s how it is .

Looking for the good, bad, and the ugly of home health jobs. 

Considering leaving my FT outpatient (completely inflexible) position to a PT home health job (for flexibility) to progress into more full-time with my side.

What are things I need to ask or need to be aware of when interviewing? 

Anonymous for privacy from others in my immediate area.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I think it totally depends on how the company runs. I do HH and enjoy it and feel I’m compensated well. The pros are that you don’t have to take time off to go to an apt. I can really start and end my day whenever I want (to a degree). 
I would definitely ask if it’s PPV hourly or salary. How big of a territory do you cover. I do PPV buy territory is fairly small which is great for me. Ask what happens when there isn’t enough work. Sometimes it’s feast or famine so there are times it can get really slow. Mileage reimbursement. Do you get paid extra for going outside of your territory? Do they provide all the equipment you need like BP cuff, bag, etc. 
Some of the cons are non hygienic homes, smoking, paperwork somedays but that also gets easier, family dynamics, and at times I feel like I’m managing other things there isn’t much time for therapy. A lot of people who are appropriate for HH are very very sick so they tolerate so little and honestly a lot of them don’t get better so that can be tough. I really enjoy only seeing 1 person at a time and getting to know them and their family in their home.

> **Response 2:** The good is the flexibility for sure. The bad is the relentless paperwork and time spent on it that seriously when I was in it I think I made $5.00/hr. 
That might be not so true but the time with paperwork is insane esp with start of care.  Also some of the homes were questionable in terms of sanitation.  I went back to outpatient

Currently I just use my personal vehicle for my mobile business, I am a sole proprietor LLC. Does anyone have any advice on if I should just keep my vehicle separate from the business? I am in the growing phase and haven’t taken off financial yet. In other words I want the tax benefits but I also don’t wanna break the bank on insurance.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** When I consulted with a trusted insurance broker (close friend of mine…not scammy at all), she said if you plan to use your car to travel to and from your work, it’s strongly recommended to add non-hired auto to your malpractice bundle. If you get into an accident your personal auto insurance won’t cover damages. You can typically add non hired on to your business’ personal, professional, cyber etc for a reasonable annual fee. I wound up not using it (I live in an urban area and mainly use public transportation) but remember it not being a significant amount.

> **Response 2:** My accountant told me to buy under personal, but could still write off as business. I would check your state laws and with your accountant.

Hey guys, I’m in a season of life where I can no longer run my own practice. I ended up closing about 2 years ago to stay home with my kids. I was planning on going back to a PRN or part time position in the fall, however, my 8 month old has spina bifida so anything outside of the home is out since we will not be putting her in any sort of childcare. Does anyone know of any remote work I can do in the field other than telehealth visits?

Editing to add: I’m licensed in Texas.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Check with PT programs, esp the hybrid ones. They usually are looking for adjuncts and there are some roles that are completely remote.

Is this what other people have experienced? Is this so that it doesn't get confused with home health? Any input appreciated. Thank you 🙂

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** According to CMS chapter 15 section 220 therapists in private practice can see patients in their clinic or the patient's home. I would keep with patient's home to be accurate. Your business should have been credentialed with medicare to see patients in their homes.

They will be having a PT come to her home as part of their care plan. I was told by a Medicare rep that she can only see one PT at a time. Do I need to discontinue working with her once she starts with the company or just when she starts working with the PT?

I just started smart cuffs and it's not feasible to give the patient my pump to borrow. (Mobile PT).

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Research indicates no difference between elastic and pneumatic cuffs, so have them get the cheap ones on Amazon if you want them to do it at home

Any implications saying “concierge” instead of mobile PT? I’ve gotten some increased interest with the fancy word concierge. Just FYI!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I like concierge better because it implies cash pay. People know what they are getting into.  Mobile PT reads close to home PT in people's minds so often they are still expecting an insurance model.

For my mobile PTs- esp pelvic floor therapists who provide internal examinations and treatments, do you do an initial evaluation via telehealth to determine if the patient maybe a good fit?

Also for any mobile PT/OT, how did you get that feeling of being okay to go to a patient's home? I've always worked in an outpatient setting where patients came to me. But as I begin to venture off I just worry for my safety. How did you get past this hump? Looking for any advise/tips/tricks!?!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I do mobile pelvic health and I have never had any weird situations going into people's homes. We have them complete an intake form and oftentimes there is communication via email or via phone prior to their first session.  Maybe I'm naive, but I just really don't worry about it.  Prior to this I did early intervention in some sketch neighborhoods and even then I still was not nervous or afraid. It's just is what it is and as long as people know where you are, you can't live your life being afraid of every situation

> **Response 2:** I worked in home health for a decade before starting a mobile OP practice. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I felt a little sketched out in a home and I’ve never actually had an incident.

**Community Responses:**

You can set up rules to auto classify certain routes that are always business or always personal so you don’t have to manually touch every drive. It’s only around $50 for an annual fee.

Is there anyone in this group that maintains a mobile private practice as well as teaches part time?￼

I’m convinced that if I maintain working in the clinical sense, I want to try and get my own business going with some contract home health/outpatient coverage as needed while it builds up.

I have been entertaining the move to teaching for a bit but logistically couldn’t consider it as we don’t want to leave the area where we live. The nearest physical therapy program is about 1.5 hours away. ￼With the development of hybrid programs, it’s becoming a possibility to teach and not have to move.￼￼

I know a lot of faculty at PT programs treat on the side. Most of these are in clinic or outpatient rehab department settings. I’m trying to see if it’s feasible to do the same thing with my own mobile practice.￼

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** You can also check out PTA programs or even college courses like anatomy. I am a site supervisor for one university and hoping to get involved as a lab instructor at another school. But I'm not a full time PT rn. I can definitely see it working out and I think it would be a really unique experience for students to see you doing mobile outpatient

> **Response 2:** I do! My semester starts next week and I’m already anticipating lots of chaos! I teach a lecture and lab, so it’s 9 hours per week of standing in front of a class with 4 different presentations for 12 weeks. My mobile practice was muuuch smaller last time I was lead teacher (I assisted lab this spring and that was manageable as I didn’t have much out of class responsibilities). I’m at the PT program 2 days/week and squeezing my caseload into the other three days. Weekends and late nights are I guess when I’ll do notes and update course content/grade (after my own kids have worn me out). Sorry, I realize this might scare you! I really love teaching and love seeing the students turn into professionals!! Feel free to PM me if you have other questions.

Hello all, new to the group - I’m looking into starting my own company focusing exclusively on telehealth. I’m in Pennsylvania where some legislation was passed this year guaranteeing reimbursement for telehealth.  

Looking for any guidance or resources specific to telehealth and starting a company in Pennsylvania.  Thanks all!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Are you sure? I live in PA and received a notice saying telehealth reimbursement was terminated September 30

> **Response 2:** So what's the difference between telehealth out of network/cash vs PT Coaching? Think there's real opportunity. If truly following the insurance model, even if not using them for reimbursement, may be leaving money an options on the table.

Okay, it's time to see my first patient.. 

Mobile PT's - what equipment do you use the most? Would love some links to your fav equipment (portable table, lotions, etc). After creating my LLC months ago, I am officially going to begin marketing this week! LET'S GO!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** *Portable massage table
*Foam balance pad
Foldable portable stool
Cleaning wipes
*Set of resistance loops
*Set of resistance tubes that latch onto handles or ankle loops
*Masking or painter's tape 
*BP cuff and pulse ox
*3-4 foot PVC pipe (or a broomstick)
Manual/IASTM tools of your choice
Masks (if you plan to mask)
Loved my latching clipboard when I had it, but making do without
*Reliable device to do notes on and take pictures/video (no cloud uploading, though)

On my wishlist right now are:
Car compatible charging port for my laptop (mine requires a 🔌 outlet)
Adjustable agility hurdles

Also, since you're probably about to spend a lot more time in the car (congrats on getting things rolling!), a good lunch box for cold car snacks and drinks. 🙃

> **Response 2:** BP cuff, stethoscope & pulse ox, reflex hammer, goniometer, inclinometer, stop watch; cheap agility set with cones, ladder & hurdles, aerobic step, therabands (don’t leave them in sun/heat they melt), kinesiotape, foam roller, basic first aid kit. Adjustable crutches, collapsible straight cane. Painter’s tape to temporarily mark floor/walls. Travel massage table (too light = too narrow & flimsy), paper gowns (I put them on the table instead of a sheet). Pre-printed handouts with basic info re: managing acute conditions, favorite exercise routines. Good luck!!!

Can someone answer some questions about the PT Compact for me? 
If you want to practice in another state via telehealth, you pay the state’s compact fee and take whatever test they require, and you are good to practice, correct? What about maintaining requirements? Do you have to do specific CEUs for that state? Do you have to pay the compact fee every 2 years to relicense? Are there any stipulations on practicing via telehealth? Thanks!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** If you don’t live in the compact state, I don’t believe you can join the compact at all is my understanding? I’ll be following this to see if it’s different, but that would be fantastic.
I do not live in a compact state and yes, I have obtained licensure in multiple other states individually. You pay each fee for each state separately and each state has different requirements.

All mobile PTs: 
What are some must haves for working from your car? I’m a pediatric PT who just opened up my own mobile PT company, so I’m just wanting to optimize my time between patients as well as just making sure I’m not missing out on great things I could keep in my car!

**Community Responses:**

**Community Responses:**

I use H+ Cuffs and a Doppler so no iPhone App needed or power source. Can even use at the local park.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I am (S corp though, can't have LLCs in CA). I have a UPS box but I might swithc over to a "virtual mailbox" soon.

From an online search: A virtual mailbox for an LLC provides a real street address for receiving and managing business mail remotely, without the need for a physical office. It's a cost-effective way to maintain a professional presence, separate personal and business mail, and manage mail online. Several virtual mailbox providers, like Bizee, Anytime Mailbox, Planet Express, PostScan Mail, and iPostal1, offer this service.

> **Response 2:** I use iPostal1. It's $14.99/month and my address is at a Staples. It's been great for me going on almost 3 years now.

For those who provide part B services in the home or ALF, how does an insurance carrier (in this case a managed Medicare provider) differentiate services provided by a home health or part B provider? Is it a whole different claim form or lime item on a claim form? One of our regional insurances is no longer covering services from the outpatient part B provider I work for because “home visits “ need to be provided by a home health agency…

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** It’s because managed care companies don’t know the difference between home health and home outpatient. Medicare never has an issue with code 12 on place of service. I’d bill certain payors like these as code 11, because when you’re mobile you are taking the office to them. I know very prominent persons in billing that would say that as well

> **Response 2:** Thanks for your responses, I am not sure which code is on place of service, but can look into that further. I am in NY and the insurance company stating they will not cover additional therapy services in “ALF/home”because my employer is not a home health agency is CDPHP.

**Community Responses:**

I have a location and have HPSO business coverage.  It’s a different division of their company but still affordable.

For those of you that use a Cubii, with your patients what are your favorite uses?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I have my home patients buy their own    If they are sitting under desk or table.  Or a regular one for sitting on couch or chair   Mainly for circulatory issues or severe sedentary

> **Response 2:** Cubii go has wheels and a telescoping handle. I can transport it easily in and out of my car and into patients home. I’ve had several who have purchased one for themselves because they like it so much. Much sturdier than any of the dinky seated restorator “bikes” out there. I added Velcro straps

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Lesli Jenkins can you help here?  Thanks☺️

> **Response 2:** Hey there! What type of specialty are you thinking about doing? I'm an OT with my own mobile practice. We see oncology rehab and lymphedema patients and right now we only have OTs. We do not have any trouble with getting referrals but I can see if you had a specialty like neurology how you would need a PT OT and speech to be effective.

I currently have a mobile PT practice and work in home health. I was approached about leasing a space for my own clinic. I’m looking for any advice or tips for making the decision to switch from mobile to owning a clinic. It’s been my goal for down the road, but I’m very intrigued and excited about the thought of doing it now.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Feel free to DM me. I was HH contract for 8 years then added mobile outpatient (part B and cash) in 2019 and started renting space for brick and mortar in early 2023.

> **Response 2:** Do you think it will be more lucrative or are you sick of traveling? 

Operating cost is a lot lower if you don’t pay rent so I’m not sure how much of a pay hike you’d see unless you have a great business model to get clients in the door or referrals from providers.

Anyone in NJ practicing via Telehealth? If so, how many sessions do you perform in this forum? Are you in network ( if so with which insurances)? Out of network? 

I've read our practice act and see that it has to be reasonable as per clinician and wanted to see if this was a practical option to have in my clinic.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I offer both mobile and telehealth services. I'm private pay only. 
At one point all of my pts were virtual (and seeing great outcomes) but there has been a shift in the last 9 months and most have been looking for in person. 
The ones who have been open to telehealth have had reservations initially but quickly see how effective they can be... and then # of sessions will depend on their goals just like any in person session.  On average 5-12 sessions I'd estimate. 

Happy  to chat further!

> **Response 2:** Harsh Prajapati & Laurie Hutt Katz might be able to help

Does anyone have experience with Wix websites? I can’t figure out how to make one section of my website appear normally on the mobile screen. The desktop version is perfect but when I switch to mobile I can’t edit it to show everything from the desktop. Help!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Thanks guys! It’s a formatting issue that I can’t seem to fix even on the mobile editor; maybe a glitch on Wix’s end or user error because I’m learning! I’ll follow up with their help team too.

> **Response 2:** Yes I do! Just created a website. For some reason the web version isn’t completely compatible with the mobile version. You should be able to see everything carry over, it may just be in a different order or location. Edit the mobile however you desire, I always edit from my laptop. It’s okay if the web and mobile versions aren’t 100% the same, my mobile view is a bit more simple than the web.

I’ve worked in brick and mortar for 30 years and have decided to start a mobile practice. Ditch the overhead and see a few patients a week out of their homes. My only concern now is safety. How do mobile PTs mitigate risks?

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I wouldn't think its any different than bringing people into your own clinic. I always talk to patients (no online booking systems) to make sure I 1. feel like we are a good fit for each other and 2. make sure there are no red flags when booking

> **Response 2:** We use a telehealth model but occasionally do a mobile visit. When my OTs go to a home, I have them text me when they enter and leave so I know they are ok.

TAKING PAYMENTS

I'm looking for a service that will let me take payments:
- in person with a card
- online via invoice 
- online, as able (paying toward their balance as able)
- online, in a set payment plan for one total sum (must be able to set the repayment period options myself)
- online, with automatically recurring charges for subscription plans

I currently use Square and it's been just fine, but I want to offer folks more options and let them be able to see their remaining balance. I don't think there's a way to do that with Square, but I'm happy to be corrected!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Hey! I believe you can do all of this (with the exception of paying as able, which you may be able to) on square. I do almost all of it currently.

For those doing home visits...do you use any spray or other preventative measures to decrease the risk of bringing home bed bugs or other things??

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Look up home health bag technique on YouTube. It helps to prevent the spread of infestation and infection. 

I know my areas well and know when not to bring my bag in home and only bring in the bare essentials (based on area). If there is bed bugs you are required to follow contact precautions and wear the appropriate PPE. 

On your initial evaluation you need to assess the home for things like this. I suggest always carrying extra trash bags and clothing with you each day for your own safety. 

I’ve been doing HH for several years now. Hope this helps.

> **Response 2:** If I wear shoe booties, bring my own seat, and only bring in necessary items, am I ok? I plan to throw away the booties after I'm done. Should I bring a change of shoes? Changing clothes seems tricky to manage while keeping things clean. If I only sit on my own seat, and wipe things down with disinfectant wipes before putting them in my car, am I good?

I started with a new cash based mobile PT client in a Skilled  Nursing Facility this week and had plans to work with this individual a few times per week. However, the daughter has now informed the facility doesn't allow outside services, but can pay their PTs if additional services are needed. Does anyone know the rules on this and does that sound right for the family to not have a choice on who they use for PT Services? Any help is appreciated.

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Eric Avery -- yes, that is true (this is the same situation before in the place where I was a DOR). And it's because of liability issues. Also, all SNF staff in the nursing home needs to comply with AHCA & other regulations (such as facilities preparing for annual surveys). SNFs, however, do allow outside services. Still, there has to be an agreement “company to company” (for example of services like diagnostics) and the company has to show proof of malpractice insurance, etc., for the SNF administrator to sign the agreement. - for the situation you have.. the SNF has a rehab department, then the rehab staff in the SNF will provide the service.

**Edited to add one more question**

I’ve been seeing some posts/comments about contracting with home health companies. I’m exploring the idea of contracting with a home health company through my LLC. I would love to hear your insights as this is an avenue I have never explored. 

What do you think are the unique benefits for a home health company when they contract with a private practice physical therapist? Whether it’s specialized skills, flexibility, or something else? What are the unique benefits for the private practice owner or solo practitioner? 

I have minimal experience with the home health setting in general, so what are some pros/cons to consider? Any special considerations when developing a contract?

Is anyone comfortable sharing rates they’ve accepted with home health companies to help develop a realistic proposal?

What are the potential tax benefits (if any) working 1099 for a home health company contracting through your LLC as opposed to working PRN for home health and working under your LLC separately? 

Any thoughts and experiences you would like to share are greatly appreciated!!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I would encourage you to check out the resources on APTA Home Health- as a member of the practice committee, I can vouch for how useful this information is. Home health is very different from mobile OP in the home but it can be a great way to set up another revenue stream.

**If you think about it, do you know what makes you most nervous about new, inexperienced drivers?**  

Maybe you have one at home.

It's that they often *fail to check their blind spots*.  

They drive looking only at what's right in front of them -* literally, **right** in front of them*; unaware that a hazard may be lurking from the side.

Have you ever thought that, perhaps, this could be how your are "driving" your new vehicle - i.e. that new practice you are building?

You may find that the latest UNCAGED CLINICIAN Blog has a valuable thought to consider!

Hello! I have been sitting in the shadows but I think I’m finally ready to start my own online and travel business. I know treating across state boarders can be tricky but I have seen plenty of great approaches to achieving this. Would some of you mind sharing how you go about virtual treatment over state lines as well as how you word things for your evaluations/treatments. Do you call it coaching? Or training? Also what are you charging for evaluations and follow ups (currently located in New England area) and does this change for in person vs virtual? Fill me in please! 

Thank you :)

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I don't treat across state lines but I would keep your prices the same for in person or virtual. Your time is your time, period.

**Community Responses:**

Typically their rate offers are less than what we get from Medicare (or cash rates) and come with the burden of egregious documentation requirements.

Could be worthwhile if you have schedule gaps or working to build caseloads but otherwise didn’t make much sense to me.

I have an out of network practice & while I am building my business I also work prn for a home health agency. I am seeing a few patients in home health with Parkinson's that have exhausted their medicare benefits for home health & attending outpatient PT is not an option for them. 2 different families have recently  requested me to continue working with them privately. 

Is there a way to do this legally if I have them sign an ABN form & see them under my personal LLC? Thanks for the advice!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** Throwing it out there, may be a good idea to have Luna PT as another avenue since you can go through Medicare on the app. Might be less than what you charge but they take care of all the referral, POC, and billing issues which is amazing. I’ve done that with some of my HH patients

> **Response 2:** Have you thought about personal training for patients who don't meet the standards of skilled physical therapy services?

Please consider advocating for an extension of telehealth coverage for rehab services.  It is set to expire tomorrow at midnight.  APTA has a nice pre-filled form you can send to your representatives.

**Original Post:**
Has anyone run a drop in fitness session for a large group at a large venue... like where people are walking around and can try a few exercises by video to see if they want to join your online fitness class? With my regular online classes I have clients sign an exercise waiver, but can I just add a disclaimer at the beginning of the video or post it in my booth? I run an online pre-ski program and will be at the Boston Snowbound Expo that has already sold +23,000 tickets, so I want people to be able to try a few exercises by video while they stop by the booth without having to track down waiver while talking with others at the booth.

A lot of hospital clinics near me are halting their speech therapy telehealth offerings as of May 2023. I didn't anticipate a stoppage of coverage for my virtual SLP private practice. Can someone point me to a resource where I can look this up myself?
Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I imagine it has to do with Covid numbers dropping. Insurances/Medicare are stopping things like that

Has anyone switched to Netsmart for their EMR? The company I work for does mobile outpatient for PT and OT. I am hoping we can add a clinic in the upcoming year.  We have 9-10 clinicians and have used HelloNote for years. Overall the therapists have not been particularly impressed with the flow on Hellonote nor the scheduling for what we need as a mobile practice. I liked the demo with Netsmart, but I’m getting push back from a consultant we use that a lot of her clients have not liked Netsmart.

**Community Responses:**

I'm currently building up my mobile med B caseload, and in the meantime I do Med A homecare per diem as well. Have a Med A patient I recently discharged (less than 2 weeks ago) reach out to me and wanted to know if there was any way I can come back and see her more. She is wonderful and I'd love to. I am par with MC and she has traditional MC, so in theory I could. Am I opening myself up to trouble seeing patients under Med A and then med B? I don't want to expose myself to any problems being her therapist for both.  Thank you!

**Community Responses:**

> **Response 1:** I see clients in my ALF under med A and then under med B. I would just be cautious if there is something in your employment contract about independently working with any clients you’ve treated through your home care agency.

📢 ADVOCACY REQUEST!! 📢 

If you are a practicing PT, OT, or SLP you likely are aware that Medicare plans to eliminate our ability to provide services via telehealth starting 1/1/25. For the past four years, my team and I have been able to provide pain management services to underserved and rural populations in Maryland because of telehealth. In fact, an article in MedPage Today from Nov. 27th highlighted that the rates of chronic pain have INCREASED since the onset of the opioid epidemic--from about 20% to 24%--and that healthcare SHOULD be leveraging technology to reach those who cannot access effective and appropriate care. 

Unless Congress intervenes in the next couple of weeks, this Medicare mandate will become permanent. Today, I am asking all of my fellow PTs, OTs, and SLPs to consider advocating for the continuance of telehealth services. Your voice DOES matter, I promise! Please click/copy paste the link below associated with your respective area of practice, select the "Make Telehealth Access Permanent," and submit your request to your congressional representatives. This whole process should take about 2 minutes. Thank you!

One of the areas I  have really enjoyed working with workers comp cases in the past so I was wondering if it was possibly to work directly with company’s and providing mobile OT for the cases or if the insurance companies typically like to send to brick and mortar clinics.

This is excellent. Please take a look at this video regarding chronic pain. I am going to begin implementing this right away with my patients.  I don’t think the video will be up for too much longer for free so please try today.  Maybe we can start a dialogue here about if you have ever learned of tapping, do you use it with your patients and what results have you seen?  I look forward to some dialogue.

I Currently work for a home health agency. I also happen to have my own LLC formed and see cash based clients. 

My bosses want to integrate “outpatient in home services” but they’re already a home health agency. 

I was thinking to credential my LLC with the insurances and Medicare and contract myself (PT and PTA) from the home health agency for the outpatient visits. 
Patients typically already meet their acute episode but really have potential for more they only want myself and the PTA to treat them. We usually refer them out to outpatient with other therapists. 

Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated.

Took her off her memitine as thought was not helping but going to put her back on. I told my sister that she needs OT to work on cognitive rehab. She has speech come in by just confused her more. Do any private OTs come into these facilities to do this. They have hospital based PT in facility but I sometimes like a private therapist. She gets PT there from a th rapist who has his own mobile practice and she loves him.

Does anyone use some sort of automated system to check the home health status of multiple Medicare patients at a time? We’ve had issues lately where the patients have not told us that they have a home health case opened which resulted in our part B funds needing to be sent back to Medicare, which has been a big hit to our mobile practice. I know that we can check every individual patient’s home health status one at a time, but being that we are treating many patients, this is too tedious/time consuming to do on a daily basis. Does anyone use any special software for this? Or any system.

Hello!! Recommendation for EHR?? Looking for something that allows health information exchange (HIE) with surrounding hospitals. 

Tried AthenaHealth, they have HIE, but are not conducive to mobile practice. 

Currently with Advanced MD, great for mobile practice, HIE is only available when requested by receiving party, which does not help. No one will likely request records. 

I do not expect to get many answers, but worth a shot! TIA!

I'm looking to start seeing a couple Medicare patients at my own mobile practice but I also work for a company and I'm enrolled through Medicare through that company. What form(s) would I need to fill out to Add my own business info so that I can get signed up with Medicare for services rendered for my mobile practice? Is it still the 855I?

Hi everyone! I'm not yet uncaged, but looking for someone who is. I work in hospital based OP, and have a patient who really requires more supervision and tx than we can offer right now at my clinic. In addition, the pt doesn't drive, and her niece has had to cancel a ton of appointments because she can't drive her here every week. She's been coming in for balance and we've mostly been working on strengthening, with a little vestibular training thrown in. Even with comprehensive note -taking she just doesn't remember cues by the time she gets home, and sometimes doesn't remember having talked about an exercise at all. BUT she's really pleasant, and hilarious. 

All that to be said, she'd benefit from in-home care, but can't get it through the hospital system because she's not home bound.

Anyone mobile in the Portland, OR area who takes Medicare? I'd love to be able to offer her a name or two to contact. Seems like she's also willing to consider self-pay, but she's paid into Medicare her whole life and should be able to use it.

Thank you!
